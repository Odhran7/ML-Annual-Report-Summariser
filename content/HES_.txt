see item 1a risk factors for a discussion of competition and market conditions 

emergency preparedness and response plans and procedures 

we have in place a series of business and assetspecific emergency preparedness response and business continuity plans that detail procedures for rapid and effective emergency response and environmental mitigation activities these plans are maintained reviewed and updated as necessary to confirm their accuracy and suitability where applicable they are also reviewed and approved by the relevant host government authorities 

responder training and drills are routinely held worldwide to assess and continually improve the effectiveness of our plans our contractors service providers representatives from government agencies and where applicable joint venture partners participate in the drills to help ensure that emergency procedures are comprehensive and can be effectively implemented 

to complement internal capabilities and to help ensure coverage for our global operations we maintain membership contracts with a network of local regional and global oil spill response and emergency response organizations at the regional and global level these organizations include cga msrc mwcc wwcc and osrl cga and msrc are domestic spill response organizations 

and mwcc provides the equipment and personnel to contain underwater well control incidents in the gulf of mexico wwcc provides firefighting well control and engineering services globally osrl is a global response organization and is available when needed to assist us with any of our assets in addition to owning response assets in their own right the organization maintains business relationships that provide immediate access to additional critical response support services if required osrl’s response assets include nearly 300 recovery and storage vessels and barges more than 250 skimmers over 600000 feet of boom nine capping stacks and significant quantities of dispersants and other ancillary equipment including aircraft in addition to external well control and oil spill response support we have contracts with wildlife environmental meteorology incident management medical and security resources if we were to engage these organizations to obtain additional critical response support services we would fund such services and where appropriate seek reimbursement under our insurance coverage as described below in certain circumstances we pursue and enter into mutual aid agreements with other companies and government cooperatives to receive and provide oil spill response equipment and personnel support we maintain close associations with emergency response organizations through our representation on the executive committee and response network committee of mwcc technical operations committee of cga and oil spill and emergency response committee of api we also maintain regular voting membership in cga msrc and osrl 

we continue to participate in several industrywide task forces that are studying better ways to assess the risk of and prevent onshore and offshore incidents access and control blowouts in subsea environments and improve containment and recovery methods the task forces are working closely with the oil and gas industry and international government agencies to implement improvements and increase the effectiveness of oil spill prevention preparedness response and recovery processes 

insurance coverage and indemnification 

we maintain insurance coverage that includes coverage for physical damage to our property thirdparty liability workers’ compensation and employers’ liability general liability sudden and accidental pollution and other coverage this insurance coverage is subject to deductibles exclusions and limitations and there is no assurance that such coverage will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences and damages 

the amount of insurance covering physical damage to our property and liability related to negative environmental effects resulting from a sudden and accidental pollution event excluding windstorm coverage for which we are selfinsured varies by asset based on the assets estimated replacement value or the estimated maximum loss in the case of a catastrophic event first party coverage consists of two tiers of insurance the first 400 million of coverage is provided through an industry mutual insurance group above this 400 million threshold insurance is carried which ranges in value up to 535 million in total depending on the asset coverage level as described above the decrease in the total value of insurance above the 400 million threshold from december 31 2020 is primarily driven by the sale of our interests in denmark in august 2021 the insurance programs covering physical damage to our property exclude business interruption protection for our ep operations additionally we carry insurance that provides thirdparty coverage for general liability and sudden and accidental pollution up to 850 million which coverage under a standard joint operating arrangement would be reduced to our participating interest our insurance policies renew at various dates each year future insurance coverage could increase in cost and may include higher deductibles or retentions or additional exclusions or limitations in addition some forms of insurance may become unavailable in the future or unavailable on terms that are deemed economically acceptable 

generally our drilling contracts and most of our other offshore services contracts provide for a mutual hold harmless indemnity structure whereby each party to the contract the corporation and contractor indemnifies the other party for injuries or damages to their personnel and property and often those of its contractorssubcontractors regardless of fault variations may include indemnity exclusions to the extent a claim is attributable to the gross negligence andor willful misconduct of a party thirdparty claims on the other hand are generally allocated on a fault basis 

we are customarily responsible for and indemnify the contractor against all claims including those from third parties to the extent attributable to pollution or contamination by substances originating from our reservoirs or other property and the contractor is responsible for and indemnifies us for all claims attributable to pollution emanating from the contractor’s property variations may include indemnity exclusions to the extent a claim is attributable to the gross negligence andor willful misconduct of a party additionally we are generally liable for all of our own losses and most thirdparty claims associated with catastrophic losses such as damage to reservoirs blowouts cratering and loss of hole regardless of cause although exceptions for losses attributable to gross negligence andor willful misconduct do exist lastly some offshore services contracts include overall limitations of the contractor’s liability equal to a fixed negotiated amount variations may include exclusions of all contractual indemnities from the liability cap 

under a standard joa each party is liable for all claims arising under the joa to the extent of its participating interest operator or nonoperator variations include indemnity exclusions when the claim is based upon the gross negligence andor willful misconduct of the operator in which case the operator is solely liable the parties to the joa may continue to be jointly and severally liable for claims made by third parties in some jurisdictions further under some production sharing contracts between a governmental entity and commercial parties liability of the commercial parties to the government entity is joint and several 

government regulations 

the crude oil and natural gas industry is regulated at federal state local and foreign government levels regulations affecting elements of the energy sector are under continuous review for amendment or expansion over time which may result in incremental costs of doing business and affect our profitability see regulatory legal and environmental risks in item 1a risk factors  compliance with various existing environmental health and safety regulations is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations however increasingly stringent environmental regulations have resulted and will likely continue to result in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us and the oil and gas industry in general and may reduce demand for our products we spent approximately 16 million in 2021 for environmental remediation additionally we may be exposed to decommissioning liabilities including for divested assets for example in june 2021 the us bankruptcy court approved the bankruptcy plan for fieldwood energy llc fieldwood which includes transferring abandonment obligations of fieldwood to predecessors in title of certain of its assets including hess who are jointly and severally liable for the obligations as a result we recognized a charge of 147 million 147 million after income taxes in connection with total estimated abandonment obligations for seven leases in the west delta field in the gulf of mexico which we sold to a fieldwood predecessor in 2004 see item 3 legal proceedings and note 8 asset retirement obligations in the notes to consolidated financial statements  the level of other expenditures to comply with federal state local and foreign country regulations is difficult to quantify as such costs are captured as mostly indistinguishable components of our capital expenditures and operating expenses for further discussion of environmental health and safety regulations affecting our business see environment health and safety in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

 item 1a risk factors 

our business activities and the value of our securities are subject to significant risks including the risk factors described below these risk factors could negatively affect our operations financial condition liquidity and results of operations and as a result holders and purchasers of our securities could lose part or all of their investments it is possible that additional risks relating to our securities may be described in a prospectus supplement if we issue securities in the future 

market and thirdparty risks 

our business and operating results are highly dependent on the market prices of crude oil ngl and natural gas which can be very volatile our estimated proved reserves revenue operating cash flows operating margins liquidity financial condition and future earnings are highly dependent on the benchmark market prices of crude oil ngl and natural gas and our associated realized price differentials which are volatile and influenced by numerous factors beyond our control the major foreign oil producing countries including members of opec may exert considerable influence over the supply and price of crude oil and refined petroleum products their ability to agree on a common policy on rates of production and other matters may have a significant impact on the oil markets other factors include but are not limited to worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for crude oil ngl and natural gas political conditions and events including weather instability changes in governments armed conflict economic sanctions and outbreaks of infectious diseases such as covid19 around the world and in particular in crude oil or natural gas producing regions the cost of exploring for developing and producing crude oil ngl and natural gas the price and availability of alternative fuels or other forms of energy the effect of energy conservation and environmental protection efforts and overall economic conditions globally the sentiment of commodities trading markets as well as other supply and demand factors including covid19 may also influence the selling prices of crude oil ngl and natural gas average benchmark prices for 2021 were 6808 per barrel for wti 2020 3934 2019 5704 and 7095 per barrel for brent 2020 4321 2019 6416 in order to manage the potential volatility of cash flows and credit requirements we maintain significant bank credit facilities an inability to access renew or replace such credit facilities or access other sources of funding as they mature would negatively impact our liquidity furthermore from time to time we have entered into and may in the future enter into or modify commodity price hedging arrangements to manage commodity price volatility these arrangements may limit potential upside from commodity price increases or expose us to additional risks such as counterparty credit risk which could adversely impact our cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

our business and operations have been and may continue to be adversely affected by covid19 or other similar public health developments and related changes to demand for oil and natural gas since 2020 covid19 and related actions taken by governments and businesses including voluntary and mandatory quarantines and travel and other restrictions have significantly impacted economic activity as a result of covid19 our operations and those of our business partners service companies and suppliers have experienced and may continue to experience further adverse effects including but not limited to disruptions delays or temporary suspensions of operations including shutins of production temporary inaccessibility or closures of facilities supply chain issues and workforce impacts from illness school closures and other community response measures we have implemented a variety of health and safety measures including enhanced cleaning procedures and modified work practices such as travel restrictions health screenings vaccination policies reduced personnel at offshore platforms and onshore work sites wherever such reduction can be done safely and remote working arrangements for office workers there is no certainty that these or any other future measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus and its variants including the risk of infection of key employees and our ability to perform certain functions could be impaired by these new business practices for example our reliance on technology has necessarily increased due to our use of remote communications and other workfromhome practices which could make us more vulnerable to cyberattacks to the extent we or our business partners service companies or suppliers continue to experience restrictions or other effects our financial condition results of operations and future expansion projects may be adversely affected 

in addition to the global health concerns covid19 negatively affected the us and global economy and the demand for oil and natural gas the prolonged continuation or amplification of the outbreak of covid19 could result in further economic downturn that may affect our operating results in the longterm furthermore the effects of covid19 and concerns regarding the global spread of its variants negatively impacted the domestic and international demand for crude oil and natural gas which has contributed to price volatility and adversely affected the demand for and marketability of crude oil natural gas and ngl containment measures implemented to mitigate the spread of covid19 and its variants could continue to be widespread and lead to sustained adoption of certain behavioral changes such as reduced travel and enhanced workfromhome policies which could result in further reductions in demand for and consumption of energy commodities a reduction in consumer demand for crude oil natural gas and ngl could require further curtailments and shutins of production by the industry and further increase the costs of commercial storage and midstream contracts 

the timeline and potential magnitude of covid19 remains unknown and will depend on future developments including among others the global availability of vaccines the efficacy of vaccines against variants and the extent to which normal economic and operating conditions resume in the event one or more of our business partners is adversely affected by covid19 or the current market environment that may impact our costs and ability to conduct business with them in addition we may face an increased risk of changes in the regulation related to our business resulting from covid19 such as the imposition of limitations on our workforces ability to access our facilities we also are subject to litigation risk and possible loss contingencies related to covid19 including with respect to commercial contracts employee matters and insurance arrangements we may experience decreases in production and 

proved reserves additional asset impairments and other accounting charges if demand for crude oil natural gas and ngl decreases a sustained extension of the current market environment may make it more difficult to comply with covenants and other restrictions in agreements governing our debt and a lack of confidence in our industry on the part of the financial markets may result in a lack of access to capital any of which could lead to reduced liquidity 

as the impact from covid19 remains difficult to predict the extent to which it may negatively affect our operating results is uncertain any impact will depend on future developments and new information that may emerge regarding the severity and duration of covid19 and the actions taken by authorities to contain it or treat its impact all of which are beyond our control 

we do not always control decisions made under joint operating agreements and the parties under such agreements may fail to meet their obligations we conduct many of our ep operations through joint operating agreements with other parties under which we may not control decisions either because we do not have a controlling interest or are not operator under the agreement there is risk that these parties may at any time have economic business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours and therefore decisions may be made which are not what we believe is in our best interest moreover parties to these agreements may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone for example in june 2021 the us bankruptcy court approved the bankruptcy plan for fieldwood which includes transferring abandonment obligations of fieldwood to us and other predecessors in title of certain of its assets who are jointly and severally liable for the obligations see note 8 asset retirement obligations in the notes to consolidated financial statements  as a result actions of our contractual counterparties may adversely affect the value of our investments and result in increased costs or liabilities 

our industry is highly competitive and many of our competitors are larger and have greater resources and more diverse portfolios than we have the petroleum industry is highly competitive and very capital intensive we encounter competition from numerous companies including acquiring rights to explore for crude oil and natural gas to a lesser extent we are also in competition with producers of alternative fuels or other forms of energy including wind solar and electric power and in the future could face increasing competition due to the development and adoption of new technologies many competitors including national oil companies are larger and have substantially greater resources to acquire and develop oil and gas assets in addition competition for drilling services technical expertise and equipment may affect the availability of technical personnel and drilling rigs resulting in increased capital and operating costs many of our competitors have a more diverse portfolio of assets which may minimize the impact of adverse events occurring at any one location 

operational and strategic risks 

if we fail to successfully increase our reserves our future crude oil and natural gas production will be adversely impacted we own or have access to a finite amount of oil and gas reserves which will be depleted over time replacement of oil and gas production and reserves including proved undeveloped reserves is subject to successful exploration drilling development activities and enhanced recovery programs therefore future oil and gas production is dependent on technical success in finding and developing additional hydrocarbon reserves exploration activity involves the interpretation of seismic and other geological and geophysical data which does not always successfully predict the presence of commercial quantities of hydrocarbons drilling risks include unexpected adverse conditions irregularities in pressure or formations equipment failure blowouts and weather interruptions future developments may be affected by unforeseen reservoir conditions which negatively affect recovery factors or flow rates similar risks may be encountered in the production of oil and gas on properties acquired from others in addition replacing reserves and developing future production are also influenced by the price of crude oil and natural gas and costs of drilling and development activities lower crude oil and natural gas prices may reduce capital available for our exploration and development activities render certain development projects uneconomic or delay their completion and result in negative revisions to existing reserves while increasing drilling and development costs could negatively affect expected economic returns 

there are inherent uncertainties in estimating quantities of proved reserves and discounted future net cash flows and actual quantities may be lower than estimated numerous uncertainties exist in estimating quantities of proved reserves and future net revenues from those reserves actual future production oil and gas prices revenues taxes capital expenditures operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates and could materially affect the estimated quantities of our proved reserves and the related future net revenues in addition reserve estimates may be subject to downward or upward changes based on production performance purchases or sales of properties results of future development prevailing oil and gas prices production sharing contracts which may decrease reserves as crude oil and natural gas prices increase and other factors crude oil prices declined in 2020 and 2019 relative to comparative periods resulting in reductions to our reported proved reserves in contrast crude oil prices improved in 2021 relative to the preceding year resulting in increases to our proved reserves if crude oil prices in 2022 average below prices used to determine proved reserves at december 31 2021 it could have an adverse effect on our estimates of proved reserve volumes and on the value of our business see crude oil and natural gas reserves in critical accounting policies and estimates in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  

catastrophic and other events whether naturally occurring or manmade may materially affect our operations and financial condition our oil and gas operations are subject to numerous risks and hazards inherent to operating in the crude oil and natural gas industry including catastrophic events which may damage or destroy assets interrupt operations result in personal injury 

and have other significant adverse effects these events include unexpected drilling conditions pressure conditions or irregularities in reservoir formations equipment malfunctions or failures derailments fires explosions blowouts cratering pipeline interruptions and ruptures hurricanes severe weather geological events shortages in availability of skilled labor cyberattacks or health measures related to covid19 we maintain insurance coverage against many but not all potential losses and liabilities in amounts we deem prudent including for property and casualty losses there can be no assurance that such insurance will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences and damages for example we are selfinsured against physical damage to property and liability related to windstorms in 2021 and 2020 hurricanerelated downtime reduced net production by 4000 boepd and 8000 boepd respectively and hurricane related maintenance and repair costs were approximately 7 million in both 2021 and 2020 moreover some forms of insurance may be unavailable in the future or be available only on terms that are deemed economically unacceptable in addition the frequency and severity of weather conditions which impact our business activities may also be impacted by the effects of climate change energy needs could increase or decrease as a result of extreme weather conditions depending on the duration and magnitude of any such climate change increased energy use due to weather changes may require us to invest in order to serve increased demand a decrease in energy use due to weather changes may affect our financial condition through decreased revenues to the extent the frequency of extreme weather events increases this could adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

significant time delays between the estimated and actual occurrence of critical events associated with development projects may result in material negative economic consequences as part of our business we are involved in large development projects the completion of which may be delayed beyond what was originally planned such examples include but are not limited to delays in receiving necessary approvals from project members or regulatory or other government agencies timely access to necessary equipment availability of necessary personnel construction delays unfavorable weather conditions equipment failures and outbreaks of infectious diseases such as covid19 these delays could impact our future results of operations and cash flows 

an inability to secure personnel drilling rigs equipment supplies and other required services or to retain key employees may result in material negative economic consequences we are dependent on oilfield service companies for items including drilling rigs equipment supplies and skilled labor the availability and cost of drilling rigs equipment supplies and skilled labor will fluctuate over time given the cyclical nature of the ep industry as a result we may encounter difficulties in obtaining required services or could face an increase in cost including as a result of changes to our industry due to covid19 which may impact our ability to run our operations and deliver projects on time with the potential for material negative economic consequences in addition difficulty in recruiting and retaining adequate numbers of experienced technical personnel could negatively impact our ability to deliver on our strategic goals our future success also depends upon the continued service of key members of our senior management team who play an important role in developing and implementing our strategy an inability to recruit and retain adequate numbers of experienced technical and professional personnel in the necessary locations or the loss or departure of key members of senior management may prevent us from executing our strategy in full or in part which could negatively impact our business 

disruption failure or cyber security breaches affecting or targeting computer telecommunications systems and infrastructure used by the corporation or our business partners may materially impact our business and operations computers and telecommunication systems are an integral part of our exploration development and production activities and the activities of our business partners we use these systems to analyze and store financial and operating data and to communicate within our corporation and with outside business partners our reliance on technology has increased due to the increased use of remote communications and other workfromhome practices in response to covid19 technical system flaws power loss cyber security risks including cyber or phishingattacks unauthorized access malicious software data privacy breaches by employees or others with authorized access ransomware and other cyber security issues could compromise our computer and telecommunications systems or those of our business partners and result in disruptions to our business operations or the access disclosure or loss of our data and proprietary information in addition computers control oil and gas production processing equipment and distribution systems globally and are necessary to deliver our production to market a disruption failure or a cyber breach of these operating systems or of the networks and infrastructure on which they rely could damage critical production distribution andor storage assets delay or prevent delivery to markets and make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transactions as a result any such disruption failure or cyber breach and any resulting investigation or remediation costs litigation or regulatory action could have a material adverse impact on our cash flows and results of operations reputation and competitiveness we routinely experience attempts by external parties to penetrate and attack our networks and systems although such attempts to date have not resulted in any material breaches disruptions financial loss or loss of businesscritical information our systems and procedures for protecting against such attacks and mitigating such risks may prove to be insufficient in the future and such attacks could have an adverse impact on our business and operations including damage to our reputation and competitiveness remediation costs litigation or regulatory actions in addition as technologies evolve and these cyber security attacks become more sophisticated we may incur significant costs to upgrade or enhance our security measures to protect against such attacks and we may face difficulties in fully anticipating or implementing adequate preventive measures or mitigating potential harm 

financial risks 

we have substantial capital requirements and we may not be able to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms the exploration development and production of crude oil and natural gas involve substantial costs which may not be fully funded from operations two of the three major credit rating agencies that rate our debt have assigned an investment grade rating although currently we do not have any borrowings under our longterm credit facility a ratings downgrade continued weakness in the oil and gas industry or negative outcomes within commodity and financial markets could adversely impact our access to capital markets by increasing the costs of financing or by impacting our ability to obtain financing on satisfactory terms in addition a ratings downgrade may require that we issue letters of credit or provide other forms of collateral under certain contractual requirements environmental concerns and other factors have led to lower oil and gas representation in certain key equity market indices and may increase our costs to access the equity capital markets any inability to access capital markets could adversely impact our financial adaptability and our ability to execute our strategy 

we engage in risk management transactions designed to mitigate commodity price volatility and other risks that may impede our ability to benefit from commodity price increases and can expose us to similar potential counterparty credit risk as amounts due from the sale of hydrocarbons we may enter into commodity price hedging arrangements to protect us from commodity price declines these arrangements may depending on the instruments used and the level of additional hedges involved limit any potential upside from commodity price increases as with accounts receivable from the sale of hydrocarbons we may be exposed to potential economic loss should a counterparty be unable or unwilling to perform their obligations under the terms of a hedging agreement in addition we are exposed to risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency values and may engage in hedging activities to mitigate related volatility 

the alteration or discontinuation of libor may adversely affect our borrowing costs certain borrowings on our credit facilities may use libor as a benchmark for establishing the rate libor is the subject of recent national international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform these reforms and other pressures are expected to cause libor to be discontinued after june 30 2023 or to perform differently than in the past in the us the alternative reference rates committee which was convened by the federal reserve board and the federal reserve bank of new york has proposed sofr as an alternative to libor at this time the consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted but could include fluctuations in interest rates or an increase in the cost of our credit facility borrowings 

regulatory legal and environmental risks 

our oil and gas operations are subject to environmental risks and environmental health and safety laws and regulations that can result in significant costs and liabilities our oil and gas operations are subject to environmental risks such as oil spills produced water spills gas leaks and ruptures and discharges of substances or gases that could expose us to substantial liability for pollution or other environmental damage our operations are also subject to numerous us federal state local and foreign environmental health and safety laws and regulations noncompliance with these laws and regulations may subject us to administrative civil or criminal penalties remedial cleanups natural resource damages and other liabilities in addition increasingly stringent environmental regulations have resulted and will likely continue to result in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us similarly we have material legal obligations to dismantle remove and abandon production facilities and wells that will occur many years in the future in most cases these estimates may be impacted by future changes in regulations solvency of subsequent owners and partners and other uncertainties 

concerns have been raised in certain jurisdictions where we have operations concerning the safety and environmental impact of the drilling and development of shale oil and gas resources particularly hydraulic fracturing water usage flaring of associated natural gas and air emissions while we believe that these operations can be conducted safely and with minimal impact on the environment regulatory bodies are responding to these concerns and may impose moratoriums and new regulations on such drilling operations that would likely have the effect of prohibiting or delaying such operations and increasing their cost 

climate change and sustainability initiatives may result in significant operational changes and expenditures reduced demand for our products and adversely affect our business we recognize that climate change and sustainability is a growing global environmental concern continuing political and social attention to the issue of climate change and sustainability has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national regional or local legislation and regulatory measures to limit ghg emissions these agreements and measures may require or could result in future legislation and regulatory measures that require significant equipment modifications operational changes taxes or purchase of emission credits to reduce emission of ghgs from our operations which may result in substantial capital expenditures and compliance operating maintenance and remediation costs in addition our production is sold to third parties that produce petroleum fuels which through normal end user consumption result in the emission of ghgs 

we are prioritizing sustainable energy practices to further reduce our carbon footprint while at the same time remaining a successful operating public company however various key stakeholders including our stockholders employees suppliers customers local communities and others may have differing approaches to climate change initiatives if we do not successfully manage expectations across these varied stakeholder interests it could erode our stakeholders trust and thereby affect our reputation as a result of heightened public awareness and attention to climate change and sustainability as well as continued regulatory initiatives 

to reduce the use of petroleum fuels demand for crude oil and other hydrocarbons may be reduced which may have an adverse effect on our sales volumes revenues and margins the imposition and enforcement of stringent ghg emissions reduction requirements could severely and adversely impact the oil and gas industry and therefore significantly reduce the value of our business shareholder activism has been recently increasing in our industry and stockholders may attempt to effect changes to our business or governance whether by shareholder proposals public campaigns proxy solicitations or otherwise in addition certain financial institutions institutional investors and other sources of capital have begun to limit or eliminate their investment in oil and gas activities due to concerns about climate change which could make it more difficult to finance our business furthermore increasing attention to climate change risks and sustainability has resulted in governmental investigations and public and private litigation which could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business for example beginning in 2017 certain states municipalities and private associations in california delaware maryland rhode island and south carolina separately filed lawsuits against oil gas and coal producers including us for alleged damages purportedly caused by climate change such actions could adversely impact our business by distracting management and other personnel from their primary responsibilities require us to incur increased costs andor result in reputational harm 

we are subject to changing laws and regulations and other governmental actions that can significantly and adversely affect our business political or regulatory developments and governmental actions including federal state local territorial and foreign laws and regulations may adversely affect our operations and those of our counterparties with whom we have contracted which may affect our financial results these actions could result in tax increases retroactively through tax claims or prospectively through changes to applicable statutory tax rates modification of the tax base or imposition of new tax types additionally governmental actions could include postproduction deductions from royalty payments limitations or prohibitions on the sales of new oil and gas leases or extensions on existing oil and gas leases adverse court decisions with respect to the sale of new and existing oil and gas leases expropriation or nationalization of property mandatory government participation cancellation or amendment of contract rights imposition of capital controls or blocking of funds changes in import and export regulations the imposition of tariffs and antibribery or anticorruption laws in recent years proposals for limitations on access to oil and gas exploration and development opportunities and related litigation have grown in certain areas and may include efforts to reduce access to public and private lands restriction of exploration and production activities within governmentowned and other lands delaying or canceling permits for drilling or pipeline construction restrictions or changes to existing pipeline easements limiting or banning industry techniques such as hydraulic fracturing andor adding restrictions on the use of water and associated disposal imposition of setbacks on oil and gas sites reduction of sulfur content in bunker fuel delaying or denying airquality or siting permits advocating for increased regulations punitive taxation or citizen ballot initiatives or moratoriums on industry activity and the use of social media channels to cause reputational harm costs associated with responding to these antidevelopment efforts or complying with any new legal or regulatory requirements could significantly and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

political instability in areas where we operate can adversely affect our business some of the international areas in which we operate are politically less stable than other areas and may be subject to civil unrest conflict insurgency corruption security risks and labor unrest political instability and civil unrest in north africa south america and the middle east has affected and may continue to affect our interests in these areas as well as oil and gas markets generally in addition geographic territorial border disputes may affect our business in certain areas such as the border dispute between guyana and venezuela over a portion of the stabroek block political instability exposes our operations to increased risks including increased difficulty in obtaining required permits and government approvals enforcing our agreements in those jurisdictions and potential adverse actions by local government authorities the threat of terrorism around the world also poses additional risks to our operations and the operations of the oil and gas industry in general 

one of our subsidiaries is the general partner of a publicly traded limited partnership hess midstream lp the responsibilities associated with being a general partner expose us to a broader range of legal liabilities  our control of hess midstream lp bestows upon us additional duties and obligations including but not limited to the obligations associated with managing potential conflicts of interests and additional reporting requirements from the securities and exchange commission these heightened duties expose us to additional potential for legal claims that may have a material negative economic impact on our stockholders moreover these increased duties may lead to an increase in compliance costs

 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are subject to loss contingencies with respect to various claims lawsuits and other proceedings a liability is recognized in our consolidated financial statements when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated if the risk of loss is probable but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated or the risk of loss is only reasonably possible a liability is not accrued however we disclose the nature of those contingencies we cannot predict with certainty if how or when existing claims lawsuits and proceedings will be resolved or what the eventual relief if any may be particularly for proceedings that are in their early stages of development or where plaintiffs seek indeterminate damages 

we along with many companies that have been or continue to be engaged in refining and marketing of gasoline have been a party to lawsuits and claims related to the use of mtbe in gasoline a series of similar lawsuits many involving water utilities or governmental entities were filed in jurisdictions across the us against producers of mtbe and petroleum refiners who produced gasoline containing mtbe including us the principal allegation in all cases was that gasoline containing mtbe was a defective product and that these producers and refiners are strictly liable in proportion to their share of the gasoline market for damage to groundwater resources and are required to take remedial action to ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of releases of mtbe the majority of the cases asserted against us have been settled there are two remaining active cases filed by pennsylvania and maryland in june 2014 the commonwealth of pennsylvania filed a lawsuit alleging that we and all major oil companies with operations in pennsylvania have damaged the groundwater by introducing thereto gasoline with mtbe the pennsylvania suit has been forwarded to the existing mtbe multidistrict litigation pending in the southern district of new york in december 2017 the state of maryland filed a lawsuit alleging that we and other major oil companies damaged the groundwater in maryland by introducing thereto gasoline with mtbe the suit filed in maryland state court was served on us in january 2018 and has been removed to federal court by the defendants 

in september 2003 we received a directive from the njdep to remediate contamination in the sediments of the lower passaic river the njdep is also seeking natural resource damages the directive insofar as it affects us relates to alleged releases from a petroleum bulk storage terminal in newark new jersey we previously owned we and over 70 companies entered into an administrative order on consent with the epa to study the same contamination this work remains ongoing we and other parties settled a cost recovery claim by the state of new jersey and agreed with the epa to fund remediation of a portion of the site on march 4 2016 the epa issued a rod in respect of the lower eight miles of the lower passaic river selecting a remedy that includes banktobank dredging at an estimated cost of 138 billion the rod does not address the upper nine miles of the lower passaic river or the newark bay which may require additional remedial action in addition the federal trustees for natural resources have begun a separate assessment of damages to natural resources in the passaic river given that the epa has not selected a final remedy for the entirety of the lower passaic river or the newark bay total remedial costs cannot be reliably estimated at this time based on currently known facts and circumstances we do not believe that this matter will result in a significant liability to us because our former terminal did not store or use contaminants which are of concern in the river sediments and could not have contributed contamination along the river’s length further there are numerous other parties who we expect will bear the cost of remediation and damages 

in march 2014 we received an administrative order from the epa requiring us and 26 other parties to undertake the remedial design for the remedy selected by the epa for the gowanus canal superfund site in brooklyn new york our alleged liability derives from our former ownership and operation of a fuel oil terminal and connected shipbuilding and repair facility adjacent to the canal the remedy selected by the epa includes dredging of surface sediments and the placement of a cap over the deeper sediments throughout the canal and insitu stabilization of certain contaminated sediments that will remain in place below the cap the epa’s original estimate was that this remedy would cost 506 million however the ultimate costs that will be incurred in connection with the design and implementation of the remedy remain uncertain we have complied with the epa’s march 2014 administrative order and contributed funding for the remedial design based on an allocation of costs among the parties determined by a thirdparty expert in january 2020 we received an additional administrative order from the epa requiring us and several other parties to begin remedial action along the uppermost portion of the canal we intend to comply with this administrative order the remediation work began in the fourth quarter of 2020 based on currently known facts and circumstances we do not believe that this matter will result in a significant liability to us and the costs will continue to be allocated amongst the parties as they were for the remedial design 

from time to time we are involved in other judicial and administrative proceedings relating to environmental matters we periodically receive notices from the epa that we are a “potential responsible party” under the superfund legislation with respect to various waste disposal sites under this legislation all potentially responsible parties may be jointly and severally liable for any site for which we have received such a notice the epa’s claims or assertions of liability against us relating to these sites have not been fully developed or the epa’s claims have been settled or a settlement is under consideration in all cases for amounts that are not material beginning in 2017 certain states municipalities and private associations in california delaware maryland rhode island and south carolina separately filed lawsuits against oil gas and coal producers including us for alleged damages purportedly caused by climate change these proceedings include claims for monetary damages and injunctive relief beginning in 2013 various parishes in louisiana filed suit against approximately 100 oil and gas companies including us alleging that the companies’ operations and activities in certain fields violated the state and local coastal resource management act of 1978 as amended and caused 

contamination subsidence and other environmental damages to land and water bodies located in the coastal zone of louisiana the plaintiffs seek among other things the payment of the costs necessary to clear revegetate and otherwise restore the allegedly impacted areas the ultimate impact of such climate and other aforementioned environmental proceedings and of any related proceedings by private parties on our business or accounts cannot be predicted at this time due to the large number of other potentially responsible parties and the speculative nature of cleanup cost estimates 

in august 2020 fieldwood and related entities filed for bankruptcy relief under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code fieldwood’s bankruptcy plan which was approved by the us bankruptcy court in june 2021 includes the abandonment of certain assets including seven offshore gulf of mexico leases and related facilities in the west delta field that were formerly owned by us and sold to a fieldwood predecessor in 2004 and the discharge of fieldwood’s obligation to decommission these facilities as a result in october 2021 and february 2022 we received decommissioning orders from the bsee requiring us to decommission certain wells and related facilities located on six of the seven west delta leases we expect to receive additional orders covering the remainder of the west delta decommissioning obligations in the near future and are actively engaged with the bsee to agree on the scope and timing of decommissioning activities our decommissioning obligation derives from our former ownership of the facilities we are seeking contribution from other parties that owned an interest in the facilities as of december 31 2021 we have a liability of 147 million representing total estimated abandonment obligations in the west delta field potential recoveries from other parties that previously owned an interest in the west delta field have not been recognized as of december 31 2021 

we are also involved in other judicial and administrative proceedings from time to time in addition to the matters described above including claims related to postproduction deductions from royalty payments we may also be exposed to future decommissioning liabilities for divested assets in the event the current or future owners of facilities previously owned by us are determined to be unable to perform such actions whether due to bankruptcy or otherwise we cannot predict with certainty if how or when such proceedings will be resolved or what the eventual relief if any may be particularly for proceedings that are in their early stages of development or where plaintiffs seek indeterminate damages numerous issues may need to be resolved including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters before a loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated for any proceeding 

subject to the foregoing in management’s opinion based upon currently known facts and circumstances the outcome of lawsuits claims and proceedings including the matters disclosed above is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows however we could incur judgments enter into settlements or revise our opinion regarding the outcome of certain matters and such developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the amounts are accrued and our cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid

climate change energy transition and our strategy 

we believe climate risks can and should be addressed while at the same time providing safe affordable and reliable energy necessary to ensure human welfare and global economic development in the context of the united nations sustainable development goals the ieas 2021 world energy outlook provides four scenarios of global energy demand in 2040 based on varying levels of global response to climate change under all of the iea scenarios oil and natural gas are expected to be needed for decades to come and we expect that significant investment will be required to meet the world’s projected growing energy needs both in renewable energy sources and in oil and gas 

our strategy is to grow our resource base have a low cost of supply and sustain cash flow growth our strategy aligns with the energy transition needed to achieve the ieas sustainable development scenario which reflects the major changes that would be required to reach the energyrelated sustainable development goals of the united nations 

our commitment to sustainability starts with our board of directors and senior management and is reinforced throughout our organization our board of directors led by its environmental health and safety committee is actively engaged in overseeing hess’ sustainability practices so that sustainability risks and opportunities are taken into account when making strategic decisions our board’s compensation and management development committee has tied executive compensation to advancing our environmental health and safety goals we also have an executive led task force to consider our medium and longer term climate strategy 

in 2021 we announced our new five year ghg reduction targets for 2025 which are to reduce operated scope 1 and 2 ghg emissions intensity by approximately 44 and methane emissions intensity by approximately 52 from 2017 in january 2022 we announced our plan to reduce routine flaring at hess operated assets to zero by the end of 2025 our business planning includes actions we expect to undertake to continue reducing our carbon footprint consistent with our targets we also conduct annual scenario planning as a methodology to assess our portfolio’s resilience to differing scenarios of energy supply and demand over the longer term and to inform our understanding of future risks and opportunities in relation to the potential evolution of energy demand energy mix the emergence of new technologies and possible changes by policymakers with respect to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change

ep assets 

• in north dakota net production from the bakken shale play averaged 156000 boepd in 2021 2020 193000 boepd primarily due to the impact of lower drilling activity caused by a reduction in rig count from six to one during the first half of 2020 lower ngl and natural gas volumes received under percentage of proceeds contracts curtailed production related to the planned tioga gas plant maintenance turnaround completed in the third quarter of 2021 and the sale of our little knife and murphy creek nonstrategic acreage interests in the second quarter of 2021 which contributed net production of 2000 boepd in 2021 2020 6000 boepd net oil production was 80000 bopd in 2021 compared with 107000 bopd in 2020 ngl and natural gas volumes received under percentage of proceeds contracts were 11000 boepd in 2021 compared with 21000 boepd in 2020 as higher realized ngl prices in 2021 reduced the volumes received as consideration for gas processing fees

consolidated results of operations 

results by segment 

the aftertax income loss by major operating activity is summarized below 



a calculated as net income loss attributable to hess corporation less preferred stock dividends divided by weighted average number of diluted shares 

in the following discussion and elsewhere in this report the financial effects of certain transactions are disclosed on an aftertax basis management reviews segment earnings on an aftertax basis and uses aftertax amounts in its review of variances in segment earnings management believes that aftertax amounts are a preferable method of explaining variances in earnings since they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only the pretax amount aftertax amounts are determined by applying the income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pretax amounts 

items affecting comparability of earnings between periods 

the following table summarizes items of income expense that are included in net income loss and affect comparability of earnings between periods the items in the table below are explained on pages 37 through 40

adjusted net income loss attributable to hess corporation is a nongaap financial measure which we define as reported net income loss attributable to hess corporation excluding items identified as affecting comparability of earnings between periods which are summarized on pages 37 through 40 management uses adjusted net income loss to evaluate the corporation’s operating performance and believes that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this measure which excludes certain items that management believes are not directly related to ongoing operations and are not indicative of future business trends and operations 

net cash provided by used in operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities presented in this report is a nongaap measure which we define as reported net cash provided by used in operating activities excluding changes in operating assets and liabilities management uses net cash provided by used in operating activities before changes in operating assets and 

liabilities to evaluate the corporation’s ability to internally fund capital expenditures pay dividends and service debt and believes that investors’ understanding of our ability to generate cash to fund these items is enhanced by disclosing this measure which excludes working capital and other movements that may distort assessment of our performance between periods

comparison of results 

exploration and production 

following is a summarized statement of income for our ep operations 



excluding the ep items affecting comparability of earnings between periods in the table on page 37 the changes in ep results are primarily attributable to changes in selling prices production and sales volumes marketing expenses cash operating costs midstream tariffs dda expense exploration expenses and income taxes as discussed below 

selling prices average worldwide realized crude oil selling prices including hedging were 36 higher in 2021 compared with the prior year primarily due to the increase in brent and wti crude oil prices in addition realized worldwide selling prices for ngl increased in 2021 by 174 and worldwide natural gas prices increased in 2021 by 54 compared with the prior year in total higher realized selling prices improved aftertax results by approximately 1430 million compared with 2020 our average selling prices were as follows

united states north dakota net production was lower in 2021 primarily due to the impact of lower drilling activity caused by a reduction in rig count from six to one during the first half of 2020 lower ngl and natural gas volumes received under percentage of proceeds contracts due to higher commodity prices curtailed production related to the planned tioga gas plant maintenance turnaround completed in the third quarter of 2021 and the sale of our little knife and murphy creek nonstrategic acreage interests in the second quarter of 2021 total offshore net production was lower in 2021 primarily due to the sale of the shenzi field in november 2020 

international net crude oil production from guyana was higher in 2021 due to the production ramp up from the liza phase 1 development in 2020 net oil production in libya was higher in 2021 due to force majeure declared on production operations between january 2020 and october 2020 net natural gas production was higher at malaysia and jda reflecting higher natural gas nominations due to a recovery in economic activity which had been impacted by covid19

midstream tariffs expense tariffs expense increased from 2020 primarily due to higher tariff rates and minimum volume commitments in 2021 in 2022 we estimate midstream tariffs expense to be in the range of 1190 million to 1215 million 

dda expense dda expense was lower in 2021 primarily due to the impact to dda rates resulting from yearend 2020 revisions and additions to proved reserves lower production volumes in 2021 and the impact of impairment charges recognized in the first quarter of 2020

cash flows 

the following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows 



operating activities  net cash provided by operating activities was 2890 million in 2021 2020 1333 million while net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities was 2991 million in 2021 2020 1803 million net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities increased from 2020 primarily due to higher realized selling prices changes in operating assets and liabilities in 2021 reduced net cash provided by operating activities by 101 million primarily from higher receivables which includes premiums paid on crude oil hedge contracts and abandonment expenditures partially offset by accrued income taxes and royalties payable an increase in accrued liabilities and a decrease in crude oil inventory resulting from our vlcc transactions changes in operating assets and liabilities in 2020 reduced net cash provided by operating activities by 470 million primarily from a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities an increase in crude oil inventory resulting from our vlcc transactions and abandonment expenditures partially offset by lower receivables at december 31 2021 we have accrued income taxes and royalties payable of approximately 470 million in libya related to operations for the period december 2020 through november 2021 which we paid in january 2022 

investing activities total additions to property plant and equipment were 1747 million in 2021 2020 2197 million the decrease primarily reflects lower drilling activity proceeds from asset sales were 427 million in 2021 2020 493 million 

financing activities in 2021 we repaid 500 million of our 1 billion term loan maturing in march 2023 borrowings in 2021 related to the 750 million of 4250 fixedrate senior unsecured notes due 2030 issued by our midstream operating segment while borrowings in 2020 related to our 1 billion term loan common stock dividends paid were 311 million in 2021 2020 309 million and payments to noncontrolling interests were 664 million in 2021 2020 261 million which included 375 million paid to gip for the repurchase by hesm opco of approximately 156 million gipowned class b units in 2021 we received net proceeds of 178 million from two public offerings totaling approximately 78 million hessowned class a shares in hess midstream lp 

future capital requirements and resources 

at december 31 2021 we had 271 billion in cash and cash equivalents excluding midstream and total liquidity including available committed credit facilities of approximately 63 billion our fully undrawn 35 billion committed revolving credit facility matures in may 2024 in january 2022 we paid accrued libyan income tax and royalties of approximately 470 million related to operations for the period december 2020 through november 2021 in february 2022 we repaid the remaining 500 million outstanding under our 1 billion term loan 

net production in 2022 is forecast to be in the range of 325000 boepd to 330000 boepd excluding libya and we expect our 2022 ep capital and exploratory expenditures will be approximately 26 billion for calendar year 2022 we have wti collars with an average monthly floor price of 60 per barrel and an average monthly ceiling price of 100 per barrel for 90000 bopd and brent collars with an average monthly floor price of 65 per barrel and an average monthly ceiling price of 105 per barrel for 60000 bopd 

in 2022 based on current forward strip crude oil prices we expect cash flow from operating activities and cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2021 will be sufficient to fund our capital investment program dividends and the recent repayment of the remaining 500 million outstanding under our 1 billion term loan depending on market conditions we may take any of the following steps or a combination thereof to improve our liquidity and financial position reduce the planned capital program and other cash outlays including dividends pursue asset sales borrow against our committed revolving credit facility or issue debt or equity securities 

the table below summarizes the capacity usage and available capacity of our borrowing and letter of credit facilities at december 31 2021 



a committed and uncommitted lines have expiration dates through 2022 

b this credit facility may only be utilized by hesm opco and is nonrecourse to hess corporation 

hess corporation 

in april 2021 we amended the corporations fully undrawn 35 billion revolving credit facility that had an expiration date in may 2023 by extending the facility for one year to may 2024 and incorporating customary provisions for the eventual replacement of libor among other changes as set forth in the amended credit agreement this facility can be used for borrowings and letters of credit borrowings on the facility will generally bear interest at 140 above libor though the interest rate is subject to adjustment if the corporation’s credit rating changes at december 31 2021 hess corporation had no outstanding borrowings or letters of credit under its revolving credit facility 

in 2020 we entered into a 1 billion three year term loan agreement with a maturity date of march 16 2023 borrowings under the term loan generally bear interest at libor plus an initial applicable margin of 225 in july 2021 we repaid 500 million of the term loan and in february 2022 we repaid the remaining 500 million 

the revolving credit facility and term loan are subject to customary representations warranties customary events of default and covenants including a financial covenant limiting the ratio of total consolidated debt to total capitalization of the corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries to 65 and a financial covenant limiting the ratio of secured debt to consolidated net tangible assets of the corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries to 15 as these capitalized terms are defined in the credit agreement for the revolving credit facility and the term loan agreement the indentures for the corporations fixedrate public notes limit the ratio of 

secured debt to consolidated net tangible assets as that term is defined in the indentures to 15 as of december 31 2021 hess corporation was in compliance with these financial covenants the most restrictive of the financial covenants related to our fixedrate public notes and our term loan and revolving credit facility would allow us to borrow up to an additional 1843 million of secured debt at december 31 2021 for additional information regarding the alteration or discontinuation of libor on our borrowing costs see financial risks in item 1a risk factors  

we had 259 million in letters of credit outstanding at december 31 2021 2020 269 million which relate to our global business operations we have a shelf registration under which we may issue additional debt securities warrants common stock or preferred stock 

midstream 

at december 31 2021 hesm opco a consolidated subsidiary of hess midstream lp had 14 billion of senior secured syndicated credit facilities maturing december 16 2024 consisting of a 1 billion five year revolving credit facility and a fully drawn 400 million five year term loan a facility the revolving credit facility can be used for borrowings and letters of credit to fund hesm opco’s operating activities capital expenditures distributions and for other general corporate purposes borrowings under the five year term loan a facility will generally bear interest at libor plus an applicable margin ranging from 155 to 250 while the applicable margin for the five year syndicated revolving credit facility ranges from 1275 to 2000 pricing levels for the facility fee and interestrate margins are based on hesm opco’s ratio of total debt to ebitda as defined in the credit facilities if hesm opco obtains an investment grade credit rating the pricing levels will be based on hesm opco’s credit ratings in effect from time to time the credit facilities contain covenants that require hesm opco to maintain a ratio of total debt to ebitda as defined in the credit facilities for the prior four fiscal quarters of not greater than 500 to 100 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter 550 to 100 during the specified period following certain acquisitions and prior to hesm opco obtaining an investment grade credit rating a ratio of secured debt to ebitda for the prior four fiscal quarters of not greater than 400 to 100 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter hesm opco was in compliance with these financial covenants at december 31 2021 the credit facilities are secured by firstpriority perfected liens on substantially all of the assets of hesm opco and its direct and indirect wholly owned material domestic subsidiaries including equity interests directly owned by such entities subject to certain customary exclusions at december 31 2021 borrowings of 104 million were drawn under hesm opco’s revolving credit facility and borrowings of 390 million excluding deferred issuance costs were drawn under hesm opco’s term loan a facility borrowings under these credit facilities are nonrecourse to hess corporation 

credit ratings 

two of the three major credit rating agencies that rate our debt have assigned an investment grade rating in march 2021 standard and poor’s ratings services affirmed our credit rating at bbb and revised the outlook to stable from negative fitch ratings affirmed our bbb credit rating and revised the outlook from stable to positive in august 2021 and moody’s investors service affirmed our credit rating at ba1 which is below investment grade and revised the outlook from stable to positive in november 2021

foreign operations 

we conduct ep activities outside the us principally in guyana the joint development area of malaysiathailand malaysia libya suriname and canada therefore we are subject to the risks associated with foreign operations including political risk tax law changes currency risk corruption and acts of terrorism see item 1a risk factors for further details 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

accounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and revenues and expenses in the statement of consolidated income  the accounting methods used can affect net income equity and various financial statement ratios however our accounting policies generally do not change cash flows or liquidity 

accounting for exploration and development costs ep activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage including lease bonuses brokers’ fees and other related costs are capitalized annual lease rentals exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred costs of drilling and equipping productive wells including development dry holes and related production facilities are capitalized 

the costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if 1 the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and 2 sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operational viability of the project if either of those criteria is not met or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project the capitalized well costs are charged to expense indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves and the economic and operating viability of a project include commitment of project personnel active negotiations for sales contracts with customers negotiations with governments operators and contractors and firm plans for additional drilling and other factors 

crude oil and natural gas reserves the determination of estimated proved reserves is a significant element in arriving at the results of operations of ep activities the estimates of proved reserves affect well capitalizations the unit of production depreciation rates of proved properties and wells and equipment as well as impairment testing of oil and gas assets 

for reserves to be booked as proved they must be determined with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations in addition government and project operator approvals must be obtained and depending on the amount of the project cost senior management or the board of directors must commit to fund the project we maintain our own internal reserve estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work directly with the oil and gas properties our technical staff update reserve estimates throughout the year based on evaluations of new wells performance reviews new technical data and other studies to provide consistency throughout the corporation standard reserve estimation guidelines definitions reporting reviews and approval practices are used the internal reserve estimates are subject to internal technical audits and senior management review we also engage an independent thirdparty consulting firm to audit approximately 80 of our total proved reserves each year 

proved reserves are calculated using the average price during the twelvemonth period ending december 31 determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the price on the first day of each month within the year unless prices are defined by contractual agreements excluding escalations based on future conditions as discussed in item 1a risk factors  crude oil prices are volatile which can have an impact on our proved reserves crude oil prices used in the determination of proved reserves at december 31 2021 were 6634 per barrel for wti 2020 3977 and 6892 per barrel for brent 2020 4343 at december 31 2021 spot prices closed at 7521 per barrel for wti and 7702 per barrel for brent if crude oil prices in 2022 are at levels below that used in determining 2021 proved reserves we may recognize negative revisions to our december 31 2022 proved undeveloped reserves in addition we may recognize negative revisions to proved developed reserves which can vary significantly by asset due to differing operating cost structures conversely price increases in 2022 above those used in determining 2021 proved reserves could result in positive revisions to proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves at december 31 2022 it is difficult to estimate the magnitude of any potential net negative or positive change in proved reserves at december 31 2022 due to numerous currently unknown factors including 2022 crude oil prices the amount of any additions to proved reserves positive or negative revisions in 

proved reserves related to 2022 reservoir performance the levels to which industry costs will change in response to 2022 crude oil prices and management’s plans as of december 31 2022 for developing proved undeveloped reserves  a 10 change in proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves at december 31 2021 would result in an approximate 165 million pretax change in depreciation depletion and amortization expense for 2022 based on projected production volumes see the supplementary oil and gas data on pages 89 through 98 in the accompanying financial statements for additional information on our oil and gas reserves 

impairment of longlived assets we review long‑lived assets including oil and gas fields for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered long‑lived assets are tested based on identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities if the carrying amounts of the longlived assets are not expected to be recovered by estimated undiscounted future net cash flows the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded the amount of impairment is measured based on the estimated fair value of the assets generally determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows an income valuation approach or by a market‑based valuation approach which are level 3 fair value measurements 

in the case of oil and gas fields the present value of future net cash flows is based on management’s best estimate of future prices which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices applied to projected production volumes and discounted at a riskadjusted rate the projected production volumes represent reserves including probable reserves expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures the production volumes prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairment will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows since the standardized measure requires the use of historical twelvemonth average prices 

our impairment tests of longlived ep producing assets are based on our best estimates of future production volumes including recovery factors selling prices operating and capital costs the timing of future production and other factors which are updated each time an impairment test is performed we could experience an impairment in the future if one or a combination of the following occur the projected production volumes from oil and gas fields decrease crude oil and natural gas selling prices decline significantly for an extended period or future estimated capital and operating costs increase significantly 

as a result of the significant decline in crude oil prices due to the economic slowdown from covid19 we reviewed our oil and gas fields and midstream operating segment asset groups for impairment at march 31 2020 we impaired various oil and gas fields located in malaysia denmark and the gulf of mexico in the first quarter of 2020 primarily as a result of a lower longterm crude oil price outlook see note 12 impairment and other in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further details 

hess midstream lp we consolidate the activities of our interest in hess midstream lp  which qualifies as a variable interest entity vie under us generally accepted accounting principles we have concluded that we are the primary beneficiary of the vie as defined in the accounting standards since we have the power through hess corporation’s approximate 435 consolidated ownership interest in hess midstream lp to direct those activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of hess midstream lp  and are obligated to absorb losses or have the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to hess midstream lp  this conclusion was based on a qualitative analysis that considered hess midstream lp ’s governance structure the commercial agreements between hess midstream lp and us and the voting rights established between the members which provide us the ability to control the operations of hess midstream lp  

income taxes judgments are required in the determination and recognition of income tax assets and liabilities in the financial statements these judgments include the requirement to recognize the financial statement effect of a tax position only when management believes it is more likely than not based on the technical merits that the position will be sustained upon examination 

we have net operating loss carryforwards or credit carryforwards in multiple jurisdictions and have recorded deferred tax assets for those losses and credits additionally we have deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized if when tested under the relevant accounting standards it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized 

the accounting standards require the evaluation of all available positive and negative evidence giving weight based on the evidence’s relative objectivity in evaluating potential sources of positive evidence we consider the reversal of taxable temporary differences taxable income in carryback and carryforward periods the availability of tax planning strategies the existence of appreciated assets estimates of future taxable income and other factors estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas reserves selling prices and other subjective operating assumptions that are consistent with internal business forecasts in evaluating potential sources of negative evidence we consider a cumulative loss in recent years any history of operating losses or tax credit carryforwards expiring unused losses expected in early future years unsettled circumstances that if unfavorably resolved would adversely affect future operations and profit levels on a continuing basis in future years and any carryback or carryforward period so brief that a significant deductible temporary difference expected to reverse in a single year would limit realization of tax benefits due to a sustained low commodity price environment we remained in a threeyear cumulative loss 

position both on a consolidated basis and for certain jurisdictions at december 31 2021 a threeyear cumulative loss constitutes objective negative evidence to which the accounting standards require we assign significant weight relative to subjective evidence such as our estimates of future taxable income we are generally not recognizing deferred tax benefit or expense in certain countries primarily the us nonmidstream denmark sold in august 2021 and malaysia while we maintain valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets in these jurisdictions 

at december 31 2021 the consolidated balance sheet reflects a 3838 million valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets for multiple jurisdictions based on the evaluation of the accounting standards described above the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable however could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income change or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight is given to subjective evidence such as expected future growth 

asset retirement obligations we have material legal obligations to remove and dismantle long‑lived assets and to restore land or seabed at certain ep locations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we recognize a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations in addition the fair value of any legally required conditional asset retirement obligation is recorded if the liability can be reasonably estimated we capitalize such costs as a component of the carrying amount of the underlying assets in the period in which the liability is incurred in subsequent periods the liability is accreted and the asset is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset we estimate the fair value of these obligations by discounting projected future payments that will be required to satisfy the obligations in determining these estimates we are required to make several assumptions and judgments related to the scope of dismantlement timing of settlement interpretation of legal requirements inflationary factors and discount rate in addition there are other external factors which could significantly affect the ultimate settlement costs or timing for these obligations including changes in environmental regulations and other statutory requirements fluctuations in industry costs and foreign currency exchange rates and advances in technology as a result our estimates of asset retirement obligations are subject to revision due to the factors described above changes in estimates prior to settlement result in adjustments to both the liability and related asset values unless the field has ceased production in which case changes are recognized in our consolidated statement of income  see note 8 asset retirement obligations  

retirement plans we have funded noncontributory defined benefit pension plans an unfunded supplemental pension plan and an unfunded postretirement medical plan we recognize the net change in the funded status of the projected benefit obligation for these plans in the consolidated balance sheet  the determination of the obligations and expenses related to these plans are based on several actuarial assumptions these assumptions represent estimates made by us some of which can be affected by external factors the most significant assumptions relate to 

discount rates used for measuring the present value of future plan obligations and net periodic benefit cost the discount rates used to estimate our projected benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost is based on a portfolio of high‑quality fixed income debt instruments with maturities that approximate the expected payment of plan obligations at december 31 2021 a 025 decrease in the discount rate assumptions would increase projected benefit obligations by approximately 130 million and would increase forecasted 2022 annual net periodic benefit expense by approximately 10 million the increase in the projected benefit obligations would decrease the funded status of our pension plans but any decrease in the funded status would be partially mitigated by increases in the fair value of fixed income investments in the asset portfolios 

expected longterm rates of returns on plan assets the expected return on plan assets is developed from the expected future returns for each asset category weighted by the target allocation of plan assets to that asset category the future expected return assumptions for individual asset categories are largely based on inputs from various investment experts regarding their future return expectations for particular asset categories at december 31 2021 a 025 decrease in the expected longterm rates of return on plan assets assumption would increase forecasted 2022 annual net periodic benefit expense by approximately 10 million 

other assumptions include the rate of future increases in compensation levels and expected participant mortality 

derivatives we utilize derivative instruments including futures forwards options and swaps individually or in combination to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in the prices of crude oil and natural gas as well as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates all derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet  our policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative the changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized currently in earnings derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions cash flow hedges or hedges of changes in fair value of recognized assets and liabilities or of unrecognized firm commitments fair value hedges changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income loss amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings the change in fair value of the related hedged item is recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized currently in earnings 

fair value measurements we use various valuation approaches in determining fair value for financial instruments including the market and income approaches our fair value measurements also include nonperformance risk and time value of money considerations counterparty credit is considered for financial assets and our credit is considered for financial liabilities 

we also record certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value when required by generally accepted accounting principles these fair value measurements are recorded in connection with business combinations qualifying nonmonetary exchanges the initial recognition of asset retirement obligations and any impairment of longlived assets equity method investments or goodwill 

we determine fair value in accordance with the fair value measurements accounting standard which established a hierarchy for the inputs used to measure fair value based on the source of the inputs which generally range from quoted prices for identical instruments in a principal trading market level 1 to estimates determined using related market data level 3 including discounted cash flows and other unobservable data measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered level 2 when level 1 inputs are available within a particular market those inputs are selected for determination of fair value over level 2 or 3 inputs in the same market multiple inputs may be used to measure fair value however the level assigned to a fair value measurement is based on the lowest significant input level within this fair value hierarchy 

environment health and safety 

our longterm vision and values provide a foundation for how we do business and define our commitment to meeting high standards of corporate citizenship and creating a long lasting positive impact on the communities where we do business our strategy is reflected in our ehs  sr policies and by a management system framework that helps protect our workforce customers and local communities our management systems are intended to promote internal consistency adherence to policy objectives and continual improvement in ehs  sr performance improved performance may in the short‑term increase our operating costs and could also require increased capital expenditures to reduce potential risks to our assets reputation and license to operate in addition to enhanced ehs  sr performance improved productivity and operational efficiencies may be realized from investments in ehs  sr we have programs in place to evaluate regulatory compliance audit facilities train employees prevent and manage risks and emergencies and to generally meet corporate ehs  sr goals and objectives 

environmental matters 

we recognize that climate change is a global environmental concern we assess monitor and take measures to reduce our carbon footprint at existing and planned operations the epa has adopted a series of ghg monitoring reporting and emissions control rules for the oil and natural gas industry and the us congress has from time to time considered adopting further legislation to reduce ghg emissions for example in november 2021 the epa proposed new regulations to establish comprehensive standards of performance and emission guidelines for methane and volatile organic compound emissions from existing operations in the oil and gas sector including the exploration and production transmission processing and storage segments the epa is currently seeking public comments on its proposal which the epa hopes to finalize by the end of 2022 in addition states have taken measures to reduce emissions of ghgs primarily through the development of ghg emission inventories andor regional ghg capandtrade programs at the international level the paris agreement on climate change aimed to enhance global response to global temperature changes and to reduce ghg emissions among other things we are committed to complying with all ghg emissions regulations that apply to our operations including those related to venting or flaring of natural gas and the responsible management of ghg emissions at our facilities while we monitor climaterelated regulatory initiatives and international public policy issues the current state of ongoing international climate initiatives and any related domestic actions make it difficult to assess the timing or effect on our operations or to predict with certainty the future costs that we may incur in order to comply with future international treaties legislation or new regulations however future restrictions on emissions of ghgs or related measures to encourage use of low carbon energy could result in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us and the oil and gas industry in general and may reduce demand for our products as described under regulatory legal and environmental risks in item 1a risk factors  

we will have continuing expenditures for environmental assessment and remediation sites where corrective action may be necessary include ep facilities sites from discontinued operations where we retained liability and although not currently significant epa “superfund” sites where we have been named a potentially responsible party we accrue for environmental assessment and remediation expenses when the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable for additional information see item 3 legal proceedings  at december 31 2021 our reserve for estimated remediation liabilities was approximately 60 million we expect that existing reserves for environmental liabilities will adequately cover costs to assess and remediate known sites our remediation spending was approximately 16 million in 2021 2020 15 million 2019 20 million the amount of other expenditures incurred to comply with federal state local and foreign country environmental regulations is difficult to quantify as such costs are captured as mostly indistinguishable components of our capital expenditures and operating expenses 

as an element of our ehs and sr strategy we purchase carbon credits annually to offset 100 percent of our estimated scope 3 business travel emissions and 100 percent of our estimated scope 1 and scope 3 emissions associated with operating the corporation’s truck fleet aviation activities aircraft and helicopters and personal and rental vehicle miles driven on company business we also 

offset purchased electricity used in our operations from nonrenewable sources by purchasing renewable energy credits the cost of purchased carbon and renewable energy credits was not material to our financial results in 2021 and was included in operating costs and expenses in the statement of consolidated income  

health and safety matters 

the crude oil and natural gas industry is regulated at federal state local and foreign government levels regarding the health and safety of ep operations such laws and regulations relate to among other matters occupational safety the use of hydraulic fracturing to stimulate crude oil and natural gas production well control and integrity process safety and equipment integrity and may include permitting and disclosure requirements operating restrictions and other conditions on the development of crude oil and natural gas the level of our expenditures to comply with federal state local and foreign country health and safety regulations is difficult to quantify as such costs are captured as mostly indistinguishable components of our capital expenditures and operating expenses while compliance with laws and regulations relating to health and safety matters increases the overall cost of business for us and the oil and gas industry in general it has not had to date a material adverse effect on our operations financial condition or results of operations 

occupational safety  we are subject to the requirements set forth under federal workplace standards by the osha and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers under osha and other federal and state occupational safety and health laws and laws of foreign countries in which we operate we must develop maintain and disclose certain information about hazardous materials used released or produced in our operations 

production and well integrity  our us onshore production facilities are subject to us federal government state and local regulations regarding the use of hydraulic fracturing and well control and integrity our offshore production facilities in the gulf of mexico are subject to the us federal government’s safety and environmental management system regulations which provide a systematic approach for identifying managing and mitigating hazards adapting to new technical standards and procedures in production and in our well integrity management system is fundamental to our aim of protecting the environment as well as the health and safety of our workforce and the communities in which we operate and to safeguarding our product 

process safety and equipment integrity  we are also regulated at federal state local and foreign government levels regarding process safety and the integrity of our equipment including osha’s process safety management of highly hazardous chemicals standard ice are barriers and safeguards that prevent or mitigate process safety incidents through detection isolation containment control or emergency preparedness and response within our facilities we have established ice performance standards which set specific requirements and criteria for inspections and tests that help to ensure ice barriers are effective we conduct assessments collaboratively with our operated assets subject matter experts and technical authorities to evaluate compliance with corporate and asset environment health and safety standards and procedures as well as with applicable regulations for additional information on our emergency response and incident mitigation activities see emergency preparedness and response plans and procedures in items 1 and 2 business and properties  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of our business we are exposed to commodity risks related to changes in the prices of crude oil ngl and natural gas as well as changes in interest rates and foreign currency values in the disclosures that follow financial risk management activities refer to the mitigation of these risks through hedging activities 

controls we maintain a control environment under the direction of our chief risk officer controls over instruments used in financial risk management activities include volumetric and term limits our treasury department is responsible for administering and monitoring foreign exchange rate and interest rate hedging programs using similar controls and processes where applicable hedging strategies are reviewed annually by the audit committee of the board of directors 

instruments we primarily use forward commodity contracts foreign exchange forward contracts futures swaps and options in our risk management activities these contracts are generally widely traded instruments with standardized terms the following describes these instruments and how we use them 

• swaps we use financially settled swap contracts with third parties as part of our financial risk management activities cash flows from swap contracts are determined based on underlying commodity prices or interest rates and are typically settled over the life of the contract 

• forward foreign exchange contracts we enter into forward contracts primarily for the british pound canadian dollar and malaysian ringgit which commit us to buy or sell a fixed amount of those currencies at a predetermined exchange rate on a future date 

• exchangetraded contracts we may use exchangetraded contracts including futures on a number of different underlying energy commodities these contracts are settled daily with the relevant exchange and may be subject to exchange position limits 

• options options on various underlying energy commodities include exchangetraded and thirdparty contracts and have various exercise periods as a purchaser of options we pay a premium at the outset and are exposed to the favorable consequence of collecting payment upon exercise depending upon the underlying commodity price movement as a seller of options we receive a premium at the outset and are exposed to the unfavorable consequence of having to make payment upon exercise depending upon the underlying commodity price movement 

financial risk management activities 

we have outstanding foreign exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling 145 million at december 31 2021 that are used to reduce our exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates for various currencies the change in fair value of foreign exchange contracts from a 10 strengthening or weakening in the us dollar exchange rate is estimated to be a gain or loss of approximately 5 million respectively at december 31 2021 

at december 31 2021 our total longterm debt which was substantially comprised of fixedrate instruments had a carrying value of 8458 million and a fair value of 9897 million a 15 increase or decrease in interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of debt by approximately 390 million or 405 million respectively any changes in interest rates do not impact our cash outflows associated with fixedrate interest payments or settlement of debt principal unless a debt instrument is repurchased prior to maturity 

for calendar year 2022 we have wti collars with an average monthly floor price of 60 per barrel and an average monthly ceiling price of 100 per barrel for 90000 bopd and brent collars with an average monthly floor price of 65 per barrel and an average monthly ceiling price of 105 per barrel for 60000 bopd as of december 31 2021 an assumed 10 increase in the forward wti and brent crude oil prices used in determining the fair value of our collars would reduce the fair value of these derivative instruments by approximately 100 million while an assumed 10 decrease in the same crude oil prices would increase the fair value of these derivative instruments by approximately 100 million

see item 1a risk factors for a discussion of competition and market conditions 

emergency preparedness and response plans and procedures 

we have in place a series of business and assetspecific emergency preparedness response and business continuity plans that detail procedures for rapid and effective emergency response and environmental mitigation activities these plans are maintained 

reviewed and updated as necessary to confirm their accuracy and suitability where applicable they are also reviewed and approved by the relevant host government authorities 

responder training and drills are routinely held worldwide to assess and continually improve the effectiveness of our plans our contractors service providers representatives from government agencies and where applicable joint venture partners participate in the drills to help ensure that emergency procedures are comprehensive and can be effectively implemented 

to complement internal capabilities and to help ensure coverage for our global operations we maintain membership contracts with a network of local regional and global oil spill response and emergency response organizations at the regional and global level these organizations include cga msrc mwcc wwc and osrl cga and msrc are domestic spill response organizations and mwcc provides the equipment and personnel to contain underwater well control incidents in the gulf of mexico wwc provides firefighting well control and engineering services globally osrl is a global response organization and is available when needed to assist us with any of our assets in addition to owning response assets in their own right the organization maintains business relationships that provide immediate access to additional critical response support services if required osrl’s response assets include nearly 300 recovery and storage vessels and barges more than 250 skimmers over 600000 feet of boom nine capping stacks and significant quantities of dispersants and other ancillary equipment including aircraft in addition to external well control and oil spill response support we have contracts with wildlife environmental meteorology incident management medical and security resources if we were to engage these organizations to obtain additional critical response support services we would fund such services and where appropriate seek reimbursement under our insurance coverage as described below in certain circumstances we pursue and enter into mutual aid agreements with other companies and government cooperatives to receive and provide oil spill response equipment and personnel support we maintain close associations with emergency response organizations through our representation on the executive committees of cga and msrc as well as the board of directors of osrl 

we continue to participate in several industrywide task forces that are studying better ways to assess the risk of and prevent onshore and offshore incidents access and control blowouts in subsea environments and improve containment and recovery methods the task forces are working closely with the oil and gas industry and international government agencies to implement improvements and increase the effectiveness of oil spill prevention preparedness response and recovery processes 

insurance coverage and indemnification 

we maintain insurance coverage that includes coverage for physical damage to our property thirdparty liability workers’ compensation and employers’ liability general liability sudden and accidental pollution and other coverage this insurance coverage is subject to deductibles exclusions and limitations and there is no assurance that such coverage will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences and damages 

the amount of insurance covering physical damage to our property and liability related to negative environmental effects resulting from a sudden and accidental pollution event excluding atlantic named windstorm coverage for which we are selfinsured varies by asset based on the assets estimated replacement value or the estimated maximum loss in the case of a catastrophic event first party coverage consists of two tiers of insurance the first 400 million of coverage is provided through an industry mutual insurance group above this 400 million threshold insurance is carried which ranges in value up to 127 billion in total depending on the asset coverage level as described above the insurance programs covering physical damage to our property exclude business interruption protection for our ep operations additionally we carry insurance that provides thirdparty coverage for general liability and sudden and accidental pollution up to 850 million which coverage under a standard joint operating arrangement would be reduced to our participating interest our insurance policies renew at various dates each year future insurance coverage could increase in cost and may include higher deductibles or retentions or additional exclusions or limitations in addition some forms of insurance may become unavailable in the future or unavailable on terms that are deemed economically acceptable 

generally our drilling contracts and most of our other offshore services contracts provide for a mutual hold harmless indemnity structure whereby each party to the contract the corporation and contractor indemnifies the other party for injuries or damages to their personnel and property and often those of its contractorssubcontractors regardless of fault variations may include indemnity exclusions to the extent a claim is attributable to the gross negligence andor willful misconduct of a party thirdparty claims on the other hand are generally allocated on a fault basis 

we are customarily responsible for and indemnify the contractor against all claims including those from third parties to the extent attributable to pollution or contamination by substances originating from our reservoirs or other property and the contractor is responsible for and indemnifies us for all claims attributable to pollution emanating from the contractor’s property variations may include indemnity exclusions to the extent a claim is attributable to the gross negligence andor willful misconduct of a party additionally we are generally liable for all of our own losses and most thirdparty claims associated with catastrophic losses such as damage to reservoirs blowouts cratering and loss of hole regardless of cause although exceptions for losses attributable to gross negligence andor willful misconduct do exist lastly some offshore services contracts include overall limitations of the contractor’s liability equal to a fixed negotiated amount variations may include exclusions of all contractual indemnities from the liability cap 

under a standard joa each party is liable for all claims arising under the joa to the extent of its participating interest operator or nonoperator variations include indemnity exclusions when the claim is based upon the gross negligence andor willful misconduct of the operator in which case the operator is solely liable the parties to the joa may continue to be jointly and severally liable for claims made by third parties in some jurisdictions further under some production sharing contracts between a governmental entity and commercial parties liability of the commercial parties to the government entity is joint and several

the crude oil and natural gas industry is regulated at federal state local and foreign government levels regulations affecting elements of the energy sector are under continuous review for amendment or expansion over time which may result in incremental costs of doing business and affect our profitability see regulatory legal and environmental risks in item 1a risk factors compliance with various existing environmental health and safety regulations is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations however increasingly stringent environmental regulations have resulted and will likely continue to result in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us and the oil and gas industry in general and may reduce demand for our products we spent approximately 15 million in 2020 for environmental remediation the level of other expenditures to comply with federal state local and foreign country regulations is difficult to quantify as such costs are captured as mostly indistinguishable components of our capital expenditures and operating expenses for further discussion of environmental health and safety regulations affecting our business see environment health and safety in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

 item 1a risk factors 

our business activities and the value of our securities are subject to significant risks including the risk factors described below these risk factors could negatively affect our operations financial condition liquidity and results of operations and as a result holders and purchasers of our securities could lose part or all of their investments it is possible that additional risks relating to our securities may be described in a prospectus supplement if we issue securities in the future 

market and thirdparty risks 

our business and operating results are highly dependent on the market prices of crude oil ngl and natural gas which can be very volatile our estimated proved reserves revenue operating cash flows operating margins liquidity financial condition and future earnings are highly dependent on the benchmark market prices of crude oil ngl and natural gas and our associated realized price differentials which are volatile and influenced by numerous factors beyond our control the major foreign oil producing countries including members of opec may exert considerable influence over the supply and price of crude oil and refined petroleum products their ability to agree on a common policy on rates of production and other matters may have a significant impact on the oil markets other factors include but are not limited to worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for crude oil ngl and natural gas political conditions and events including weather instability changes in governments armed conflict economic sanctions and outbreaks of infectious diseases such as covid19 around the world and in particular in crude oil or natural gas producing regions the cost of exploring for developing and producing crude oil ngl and natural gas the price and availability of alternative fuels or other forms of energy the effect of energy conservation and environmental protection efforts and overall economic conditions globally the sentiment of commodities trading markets as well as other supply and demand factors including covid19 may also influence the selling prices of crude oil ngl and natural gas average benchmark prices for 2020 were 3934 per barrel for wti 2019 5704 2018 6490 and 4321 per barrel for brent 2019 6416 2018 7169 in order to manage the potential volatility of cash flows and credit requirements we maintain significant bank credit facilities an inability to access renew or replace such credit facilities or access other sources of funding as they mature would negatively impact our liquidity furthermore from time to time we have entered into and may in the future enter into or modify commodity price hedging arrangements to manage commodity price volatility these arrangements may limit potential upside from commodity price increases or expose us to additional risks such as counterparty credit risk which could adversely impact our cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

our business and operations have been and may continue to be adversely affected by covid19 or other similar public health developments and the recent reduced demand for oil and natural gas covid19 and the related actions taken by governments and businesses to manage the pandemic including voluntary and mandatory quarantines and travel and other restrictions have resulted in a significant and swift reduction in economic activity certain jurisdictions have begun reopening only to return to restrictions in the face of increases in new covid19 cases as a result of covid19 our operations and those of our business partners service companies and suppliers have experienced and may continue to experience further adverse effects including but not limited to disruptions delays or temporary suspensions of operations and supply chains temporary inaccessibility or closures of facilities and workforce impacts from illness school closures and other community response measures we have implemented a variety of health and safety measures including enhanced cleaning procedures and modified work practices such as travel restrictions health screenings reduced personnel at offshore platforms and onshore work sites wherever such reduction can be done safely and remote working arrangements for office workers there is no certainty that these or any other future measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the disease including the risk of infection of key employees and our ability to perform certain functions could be impaired by these new business practices for example our reliance on technology has necessarily increased due to our encouragement of remote communications and other workfromhome practices which could make us more vulnerable to cyberattacks to the extent we or our business partners service companies or suppliers continue to experience restrictions or other effects our financial condition results of operations and future expansion projects may be adversely affected 

in addition to the global health concerns of covid19 the pandemic has negatively affected the us and global economy and severely adversely impacted demand for oil and natural gas the prolonged continuation or amplification of the outbreak of covid19 could result in further economic downturn that may affect our operating results in the longterm in addition the effects of covid19 and concerns regarding its global spread have negatively impacted the domestic and international demand for crude oil and natural gas which has contributed to price volatility and adversely affected the demand for and marketability of crude oil natural gas and ngl containment measures implemented to mitigate the spread of covid19 could continue to be widespread and lead to sustained adoption of certain behavioral changes such as reduced travel and workfromhome policies which could result in further reductions in demand for and consumption of energy commodities the reduction in consumer demand for crude oil natural gas and ngl has created a supply imbalance which could require further curtailments and shutins of production by the industry and further increase the costs of commercial storage and midstream contracts 

the timeline and potential magnitude of covid19 remains unknown and will depend on future developments including among others the availability of vaccines and effective treatments and the extent to which normal economic and operating conditions resume in the event one or more of our business partners is adversely affected by covid19 or the current market environment that may impact our costs and ability to conduct business with them in addition we may face an increased risk of changes in the regulation related to our business resulting from covid19 such as the imposition of limitations on our workforces ability to access our facilities we also are subject to litigation risk and possible loss contingencies related to covid19 including with respect to 

commercial contracts employee matters and insurance arrangements we may face additional asset impairments decreases in proved reserves along with other accounting charges as demand for crude oil natural gas and ngl decreases the current environment may make it more difficult to comply with covenants and other restrictions in agreements governing our debt and a lack of confidence in our industry on the part of the financial markets may result in a lack of access to capital any of which could lead to reduced liquidity 

as the impact from covid19 remains difficult to predict the extent to which it may negatively affect our operating results is uncertain any impact will depend on future developments and new information that may emerge regarding the severity and duration of covid19 and the actions taken by authorities to contain it or treat its impact all of which are beyond our control 

we do not always control decisions made under joint operating agreements and the parties under such agreements may fail to meet their obligations we conduct many of our ep operations through joint operating agreements with other parties under which we may not control decisions either because we do not have a controlling interest or are not operator under the agreement there is risk that these parties may at any time have economic business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours and therefore decisions may be made which are not what we believe is in our best interest moreover parties to these agreements may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone in either case the value of our investment may be adversely affected 

our industry is highly competitive and many of our competitors are larger and have greater resources and more diverse portfolios than we have the petroleum industry is highly competitive and very capital intensive we encounter competition from numerous companies including acquiring rights to explore for crude oil and natural gas to a lesser extent we are also in competition with producers of alternative fuels or other forms of energy including wind solar and electric power and in the future could face increasing competition due to the development and adoption of new technologies many competitors including national oil companies are larger and have substantially greater resources to acquire and develop oil and gas assets in addition competition for drilling services technical expertise and equipment may affect the availability of technical personnel and drilling rigs resulting in increased capital and operating costs many of our competitors have a more diverse portfolio of assets which may minimize the impact of adverse events occurring at any one location 

operational and strategic risks 

if we fail to successfully increase our reserves our future crude oil and natural gas production will be adversely impacted we own or have access to a finite amount of oil and gas reserves which will be depleted over time replacement of oil and gas production and reserves including proved undeveloped reserves is subject to successful exploration drilling development activities and enhanced recovery programs therefore future oil and gas production is dependent on technical success in finding and developing additional hydrocarbon reserves exploration activity involves the interpretation of seismic and other geological and geophysical data which does not always successfully predict the presence of commercial quantities of hydrocarbons drilling risks include unexpected adverse conditions irregularities in pressure or formations equipment failure blowouts and weather interruptions future developments may be affected by unforeseen reservoir conditions which negatively affect recovery factors or flow rates similar risks may be encountered in the production of oil and gas on properties acquired from others in addition replacing reserves and developing future production are also influenced by the price of crude oil and natural gas and costs of drilling and development activities lower crude oil and natural gas prices may reduce capital available for our exploration and development activities render certain development projects uneconomic or delay their completion and result in negative revisions to existing reserves while increasing drilling and development costs could negatively affect expected economic returns 

there are inherent uncertainties in estimating quantities of proved reserves and discounted future net cash flows and actual quantities may be lower than estimated numerous uncertainties exist in estimating quantities of proved reserves and future net revenues from those reserves actual future production oil and gas prices revenues taxes capital expenditures operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates and could materially affect the estimated quantities of our proved reserves and the related future net revenues in addition reserve estimates may be subject to downward or upward changes based on production performance purchases or sales of properties results of future development prevailing oil and gas prices production sharing contracts which may decrease reserves as crude oil and natural gas prices increase and other factors crude oil prices declined in 2020 and 2019 relative to comparative periods resulting in reductions to our reported proved reserves if crude oil prices in 2021 average below prices used to determine proved reserves at december 31 2020 it could have an adverse effect on our estimates of proved reserve volumes and on the value of our business see crude oil and natural gas reserves in critical accounting policies and estimates in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  

catastrophic and other events whether naturally occurring or manmade may materially affect our operations and financial condition our oil and gas operations are subject to numerous risks and hazards inherent to operating in the crude oil and natural gas industry including catastrophic events which may damage or destroy assets interrupt operations result in personal injury and have other significant adverse effects these events include unexpected drilling conditions pressure conditions or irregularities in reservoir formations equipment malfunctions or failures derailments fires explosions blowouts cratering pipeline interruptions and ruptures hurricanes severe weather geological events shortages in availability of skilled labor cyberattacks or health measures related to covid19 we maintain insurance coverage against many but not all potential losses and liabilities in amounts we deem 

prudent including for property and casualty losses there can be no assurance that such insurance will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences and damages moreover some forms of insurance may be unavailable in the future or be available only on terms that are deemed economically unacceptable 

significant time delays between the estimated and actual occurrence of critical events associated with development projects may result in material negative economic consequences as part of our business we are involved in large development projects the completion of which may be delayed beyond what was originally planned such examples include but are not limited to delays in receiving necessary approvals from project members or regulatory or other government agencies timely access to necessary equipment availability of necessary personnel construction delays unfavorable weather conditions equipment failures and outbreaks of infectious diseases such as covid19 these delays could impact our future results of operations and cash flows 

an inability to secure personnel drilling rigs equipment supplies and other required services or to retain key employees may result in material negative economic consequences we are dependent on oilfield service companies for items including drilling rigs equipment supplies and skilled labor the availability and cost of drilling rigs equipment supplies and skilled labor will fluctuate over time given the cyclical nature of the ep industry as a result we may encounter difficulties in obtaining required services or could face an increase in cost including as a result of changes to our industry due to covid19 which may impact our ability to run our operations and deliver projects on time with the potential for material negative economic consequences in addition difficulty in recruiting and retaining adequate numbers of experienced technical personnel could negatively impact our ability to deliver on our strategic goals our future success also depends upon the continued service of key members of our senior management team who play an important role in developing and implementing our strategy an inability to recruit and retain adequate numbers of experienced technical and professional personnel in the necessary locations or the loss or departure of key members of senior management may prevent us from executing our strategy in full or in part which could negatively impact our business 

disruption failure or cyber security breaches affecting or targeting computer telecommunications systems and infrastructure used by the corporation or our business partners may materially impact our business and operations computers and telecommunication systems are an integral part of our exploration development and production activities and the activities of our business partners we use these systems to analyze and store financial and operating data and to communicate within our corporation and with outside business partners our reliance on technology has increased due to the increased use of remote communications and other workfromhome practices in response to covid19 technical system flaws power loss cyber security risks including cyber or phishingattacks unauthorized access malicious software data privacy breaches by employees or others with authorized access ransomware and other cyber security issues could compromise our computer and telecommunications systems or those of our business partners and result in disruptions to our business operations or the access disclosure or loss of our data and proprietary information in addition computers control oil and gas production processing equipment and distribution systems globally and are necessary to deliver our production to market a disruption failure or a cyber breach of these operating systems or of the networks and infrastructure on which they rely could damage critical production distribution andor storage assets delay or prevent delivery to markets and make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transactions as a result any such disruption failure or cyber breach and any resulting investigation or remediation costs litigation or regulatory action could have a material adverse impact on our cash flows and results of operations reputation and competitiveness we routinely experience attempts by external parties to penetrate and attack our networks and systems although such attempts to date have not resulted in any material breaches disruptions financial loss or loss of businesscritical information our systems and procedures for protecting against such attacks and mitigating such risks may prove to be insufficient in the future and such attacks could have an adverse impact on our business and operations including damage to our reputation and competitiveness remediation costs litigation or regulatory actions in addition as technologies evolve and these cyber security attacks become more sophisticated we may incur significant costs to upgrade or enhance our security measures to protect against such attacks and we may face difficulties in fully anticipating or implementing adequate preventive measures or mitigating potential harm 

financial risks 

we have substantial capital requirements and we may not be able to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms the exploration development and production of crude oil and natural gas involve substantial costs which may not be fully funded from operations two of the three major credit rating agencies that rate our debt have assigned an investment grade rating although currently we do not have any borrowings under our longterm credit facility a ratings downgrade continued weakness in the oil and gas industry or negative outcomes within commodity and financial markets could adversely impact our access to capital markets by increasing the costs of financing or by impacting our ability to obtain financing on satisfactory terms in addition a ratings downgrade may require that we issue letters of credit or provide other forms of collateral under certain contractual requirements environmental concerns and other factors have led to lower oil and gas representation in certain key equity market indices and may increase our costs to access the equity capital markets any inability to access capital markets could adversely impact our financial adaptability and our ability to execute our strategy 

we engage in risk management transactions designed to mitigate commodity price volatility and other risks that may impede our ability to benefit from commodity price increases and can expose us to similar potential counterparty credit risk as amounts due from the sale of hydrocarbons we may enter into commodity price hedging arrangements to protect us from commodity price declines these arrangements may depending on the instruments used and the level of additional hedges involved limit any potential upside from commodity price increases as with accounts receivable from the sale of hydrocarbons we may be exposed to potential economic loss should a counterparty be unable or unwilling to perform their obligations under the terms of a hedging agreement in addition we are exposed to risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency values and may engage in hedging activities to mitigate related volatility 

the alteration or discontinuation of libor may adversely affect our borrowing costs certain borrowings on our credit facilities and term loan may use libor as a benchmark for establishing the rate libor is the subject of recent national international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform these reforms and other pressures may cause libor to be discontinued after 2021 or to perform differently than in the past in the us the alternative reference rates committee which was convened by the federal reserve board and the federal reserve bank of new york has proposed sofr as an alternative to libor at this time the consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted but could include fluctuations in interest rates or an increase in the cost of our credit facility borrowings 

regulatory legal and environmental risks 

our oil and gas operations are subject to environmental risks and environmental health and safety laws and regulations that can result in significant costs and liabilities our oil and gas operations are subject to environmental risks such as oil spills produced water spills gas leaks and ruptures and discharges of substances or gases that could expose us to substantial liability for pollution or other environmental damage our operations are also subject to numerous us federal state local and foreign environmental health and safety laws and regulations noncompliance with these laws and regulations may subject us to administrative civil or criminal penalties remedial cleanups natural resource damages and other liabilities in addition increasingly stringent environmental regulations have resulted and will likely continue to result in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us similarly we have material legal obligations to dismantle remove and abandon production facilities and wells that will occur many years in the future in most cases these estimates may be impacted by future changes in regulations solvency of subsequent owners and partners and other uncertainties 

concerns have been raised in certain jurisdictions where we have operations concerning the safety and environmental impact of the drilling and development of shale oil and gas resources particularly hydraulic fracturing water usage flaring of associated natural gas and air emissions while we believe that these operations can be conducted safely and with minimal impact on the environment regulatory bodies are responding to these concerns and may impose moratoriums and new regulations on such drilling operations that would likely have the effect of prohibiting or delaying such operations and increasing their cost 

climate change and sustainability initiatives may result in significant operational changes and expenditures reduced demand for our products and adversely affect our business we recognize that climate change and sustainability is a growing global environmental concern continuing political and social attention to the issue of climate change and sustainability has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national regional or local legislation and regulatory measures to limit ghg emissions these agreements and measures may require or could result in future legislation and regulatory measures that require significant equipment modifications operational changes taxes or purchase of emission credits to reduce emission of ghgs from our operations which may result in substantial capital expenditures and compliance operating maintenance and remediation costs in addition our production is sold to third parties that produce petroleum fuels which through normal end user consumption result in the emission of ghgs as a result of heightened public awareness and attention to climate change and sustainability as well as continued regulatory initiatives to reduce the use of these fuels demand for crude oil and other hydrocarbons may be reduced which may have an adverse effect on our sales volumes revenues and margins the imposition and enforcement of stringent ghg emissions reduction requirements could severely and adversely impact the oil and gas industry and therefore significantly reduce the value of our business shareholder activism has been recently increasing in our industry and shareholders may attempt to effect changes to our business or governance whether by shareholder proposals public campaigns proxy solicitations or otherwise in addition certain financial institutions institutional investors and other sources of capital have begun to limit or eliminate their investment in oil and gas activities due to concerns about climate change which could make it more difficult to finance our business furthermore increasing attention to climate change risks and sustainability has resulted in governmental investigations and public and private litigation which could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business for example beginning in 2017 certain states municipalities and private associations in california delaware maryland rhode island and south carolina separately filed lawsuits against oil gas and coal producers including us for alleged damages purportedly caused by climate change such actions could adversely impact our business by distracting management and other personnel from their primary responsibilities require us to incur increased costs andor result in reputational harm 

we are subject to changing laws and regulations and other governmental actions that can significantly and adversely affect our business political or regulatory developments and governmental actions including federal state local territorial and foreign laws and regulations may adversely affect our operations and those of our counterparties with whom we have contracted which may affect our financial results these requirements relate to tax increases and retroactive tax claims disallowance of tax credits and 

deductions including postproduction deductions from royalty payments limitations or prohibitions on the sales of new and extensions on existing oil and gas leases expropriation or nationalization of property mandatory government participation cancellation or amendment of contract rights imposition of capital controls or blocking of funds changes in import and export regulations the imposition of tariffs and antibribery or anticorruption laws in recent years proposals for limitations on access to oil and gas exploration and development opportunities and related litigation have grown in certain areas and may include efforts to reduce access to public and private lands restriction of exploration and production activities within governmentowned and other lands delaying or canceling permits for drilling or pipeline construction restrictions or changes to existing pipeline easements limiting or banning industry techniques such as hydraulic fracturing andor adding restrictions on the use of water and associated disposal imposition of setbacks on oil and gas sites reduction of sulfur content in bunker fuel delaying or denying airquality or siting permits advocating for increased regulations punitive taxation or citizen ballot initiatives or moratoriums on industry activity and the use of social media channels to cause reputational harm costs associated with responding to these antidevelopment efforts or complying with any new legal or regulatory requirements could significantly and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations for example if a temporary or permanent shutdown of the dapl occurs as a result of the ongoing litigation related to use of its easement to cross under the missouri river we will need to use alternative means to transport approximately 55000 bopd of crude oil production in the bakken which may increase bakken price differentials because it would require the use of additional rail cars and personnel to move any displaced dapl barrels 

political instability in areas where we operate can adversely affect our business some of the international areas in which we operate are politically less stable than other areas and may be subject to civil unrest conflict insurgency corruption security risks and labor unrest political instability and civil unrest in north africa south america and the middle east has affected and may continue to affect our interests in these areas as well as oil and gas markets generally in addition geographic territorial border disputes may affect our business in certain areas such as the border dispute between guyana and venezuela over a portion of the stabroek block political instability exposes our operations to increased risks including increased difficulty in obtaining required permits and government approvals enforcing our agreements in those jurisdictions and potential adverse actions by local government authorities the threat of terrorism around the world also poses additional risks to our operations and the operations of the oil and gas industry in general 

one of our subsidiaries is the general partner of a publicly traded limited partnership hess midstream lp the responsibilities associated with being a general partner expose us to a broader range of legal liabilities  our control of hess midstream lp bestows upon us additional duties and obligations including but not limited to the obligations associated with managing potential conflicts of interests and additional reporting requirements from the securities and exchange commission these heightened duties expose us to additional potential for legal claims that may have a material negative economic impact on our shareholders moreover these increased duties may lead to an increase in compliance costs

 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are subject to loss contingencies with respect to various claims lawsuits and other proceedings a liability is recognized in our consolidated financial statements when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated if the risk of loss is probable but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated or the risk of loss is only reasonably possible a liability is not accrued however we disclose the nature of those contingencies we cannot predict with certainty if how or when existing claims lawsuits and proceedings will be resolved or what the eventual relief if any may be particularly for proceedings that are in their early stages of development or where plaintiffs seek indeterminate damages 

we along with many companies that have been or continue to be engaged in refining and marketing of gasoline have been a party to lawsuits and claims related to the use of mtbe in gasoline a series of similar lawsuits many involving water utilities or governmental entities were filed in jurisdictions across the us against producers of mtbe and petroleum refiners who produced gasoline containing mtbe including us the principal allegation in all cases was that gasoline containing mtbe was a defective product and that these producers and refiners are strictly liable in proportion to their share of the gasoline market for damage to groundwater resources and are required to take remedial action to ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of releases of mtbe the majority of the cases asserted against us have been settled there are three remaining active cases filed by pennsylvania rhode island and maryland in june 2014 the commonwealth of pennsylvania filed a lawsuit alleging that we and all major oil companies with operations in pennsylvania have damaged the groundwater by introducing thereto gasoline with mtbe the pennsylvania suit has been forwarded to the existing mtbe multidistrict litigation pending in the southern district of new york in september 2016 the state of rhode island also filed a lawsuit alleging that we and other major oil companies damaged the groundwater in rhode island by introducing thereto gasoline with mtbe the suit filed in rhode island is proceeding in federal court in december 2017 the state of maryland filed a lawsuit alleging that we and other major oil companies damaged the groundwater in maryland by introducing thereto gasoline with mtbe the suit filed in maryland state court was served on us in january 2018 and has been removed to federal court by the defendants 

in september 2003 we received a directive from the new jersey department of environmental protection njdep to remediate contamination in the sediments of the lower passaic river the njdep is also seeking natural resource damages the directive insofar as it affects us relates to alleged releases from a petroleum bulk storage terminal in newark new jersey we previously owned we and over 70 companies entered into an administrative order on consent with the epa to study the same contamination this work remains ongoing we and other parties settled a cost recovery claim by the state of new jersey and agreed with the epa to fund remediation of a portion of the site on march 4 2016 the epa issued a record of decision rod in respect of the lower eight miles of the lower passaic river selecting a remedy that includes banktobank dredging at an estimated cost of 138 billion the rod does not address the upper nine miles of the lower passaic river or the newark bay which may require additional remedial action in addition the federal trustees for natural resources have begun a separate assessment of damages to natural resources in the passaic river given that the epa has not selected a remedy for the entirety of the lower passaic river or the newark bay total remedial costs cannot be reliably estimated at this time based on currently known facts and circumstances we do not believe that this matter will result in a significant liability to us because our former terminal did not store or use contaminants which are of concern in the river sediments and could not have contributed contamination along the river’s length further there are numerous other parties who we expect will bear the cost of remediation and damages 

in march 2014 we received an administrative order from the epa requiring us and 26 other parties to undertake the remedial design for the remedy selected by the epa for the gowanus canal superfund site in brooklyn new york our alleged liability derives from our former ownership and operation of a fuel oil terminal and connected shipbuilding and repair facility adjacent to the canal the remedy selected by the epa includes dredging of surface sediments and the placement of a cap over the deeper sediments throughout the canal and insitu stabilization of certain contaminated sediments that will remain in place below the cap the epa’s original estimate was that this remedy would cost 506 million however the ultimate costs that will be incurred in connection with the design and implementation of the remedy remain uncertain we have complied with the epa’s march 2014 administrative order and contributed funding for the remedial design based on an allocation of costs among the parties determined by a thirdparty expert in january 2020 we received an additional administrative order from the epa requiring us and several other parties to begin remedial action along the uppermost portion of the canal we intend to comply with this administrative order the remediation work began in the fourth quarter of 2020 based on currently known facts and circumstances we do not believe that this matter will result in a significant liability to us and the costs will continue to be allocated amongst the parties as they were for the remedial design 

from time to time we are involved in other judicial and administrative proceedings relating to environmental matters we periodically receive notices from the epa that we are a “potential responsible party” under the superfund legislation with respect to various waste disposal sites under this legislation all potentially responsible parties may be jointly and severally liable for any site for which we have received such a notice the epa’s claims or assertions of liability against us relating to these sites have not been fully developed or the epa’s claims have been settled or a settlement is under consideration in all cases for amounts that are not material beginning in 2017 certain states municipalities and private associations in california delaware maryland rhode island and south carolina separately filed lawsuits against oil gas and coal producers including us for alleged damages purportedly caused by climate change these proceedings include claims for monetary damages and injunctive relief beginning in 2013 various 

parishes in louisiana filed suit against approximately 100 oil and gas companies including us alleging that the companies’ operations and activities in certain fields violated the state and local coastal resource management act of 1978 as amended and caused contamination subsidence and other environmental damages to land and water bodies located in the coastal zone of louisiana the plaintiffs seek among other things the payment of the costs necessary to clear revegetate and otherwise restore the allegedly impacted areas the ultimate impact of the aforementioned proceedings and of any related proceedings by private parties on our business or accounts cannot be predicted at this time due to the large number of other potentially responsible parties and the speculative nature of cleanup cost estimates 

we are also involved in other judicial and administrative proceedings from time to time in addition to the matters described above including claims related to postproduction deductions from royalty payments we cannot predict with certainty if how or when such proceedings will be resolved or what the eventual relief if any may be particularly for proceedings that are in their early stages of development or where plaintiffs seek indeterminate damages numerous issues may need to be resolved including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters before a loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated for any proceeding 

subject to the foregoing in management’s opinion based upon currently known facts and circumstances the outcome of lawsuits claims and proceedings including the matters disclosed above is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows however we could incur judgments enter into settlements or revise our opinion regarding the outcome of certain matters and such developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the amounts are accrued and our cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid

overview 

hess corporation is a global ep company engaged in exploration development production transportation purchase and sale of crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas with production operations located primarily in the united states us guyana the malaysiathailand joint development area jda malaysia and denmark we conduct exploration activities primarily offshore guyana in the us gulf of mexico and offshore suriname and canada at the stabroek block hess 30 offshore guyana we have announced eighteen significant discoveries the liza phase 1 development achieved first production in december 2019 and reached its nameplate production capacity of approximately 120000 gross bopd in december 2020 the liza phase 2 development was sanctioned in the second quarter of 2019 and is expected to achieve first production by early 2022 with production capacity of approximately 220000 gross bopd a third development payara was sanctioned in the third quarter of 2020 and is expected to achieve first production in 2024 with production capacity of approximately 220000 gross bopd the discovered resources to date on the stabroek block are expected to underpin up to ten fpsos with the first five fpsos producing more than 750000 gross bopd by 2026 

our midstream operating segment which is comprised of hess corporation’s 47 consolidated ownership interest in hess midstream lp at december 31 2020 provides feebased services including gathering compressing and processing natural gas and fractionating ngl gathering terminaling loading and transporting crude oil and ngl storing and terminaling propane and water handling services primarily in the bakken shale play in the williston basin area of north dakota 

hess response to covid19 and market conditions 

covid19 continues to have a profound impact on society and industry the corporation’s first priority in the midst of the pandemic has been the health and safety of the hess workforce and local communities where the corporation operates a multidisciplinary hess emergency response team has been overseeing plans and precautions to reduce the risks of covid19 in the work environment while maintaining business continuity based on the most current recommendations by government and public health agencies the corporation has implemented a variety of health and safety measures including enhanced cleaning procedures and modified work practices such as travel restrictions health screenings reduced personnel at offshore platforms and onshore work sites wherever this can be done safely and remote working arrangements for office workers in july 2020 hess midstream lp announced that the planned maintenance turnaround at the tioga gas plant originally scheduled for the third quarter of 2020 will be deferred until 2021 to ensure safe execution in light of covid19 

in addition to the global health concerns of covid19 the pandemic has severely impacted demand for oil our realized crude oil selling prices including hedging were 4428 per barrel in 2020 2019 5677 2018 6077 in response to the resulting sharp decline in oil prices the corporation’s focus is on preserving cash and capability while protecting the longterm value of its assets in the first quarter of 2020 we reduced our ep capital and exploratory budget of 30 billion for 2020 to 19 billion and we ended the year with actual capital and exploratory expenditures of 18 billion this reduction was achieved primarily by shifting from a six rig program to one rig in the bakken which was accomplished in may deferral of some 2020 development activities on the stabroek block offshore guyana and deferring discretionary spending across the portfolio in march 2020 hess entered into a 10 billion three year term loan agreement and in november we sold our 28 working interest in the shenzi field for net proceeds of 482 million after closing adjustments 

2021 outlook

consolidated results of operations 

results by segment 

the aftertax income loss by major operating activity is summarized below 



a calculated as net income loss attributable to hess corporation less preferred stock dividends divided by weighted average number of diluted shares 

in the following discussion and elsewhere in this report the financial effects of certain transactions are disclosed on an aftertax basis management reviews segment earnings on an aftertax basis and uses aftertax amounts in its review of variances in segment earnings management believes that aftertax amounts are a preferable method of explaining variances in earnings since they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only the pretax amount aftertax amounts are determined by applying the income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pretax amounts 

items affecting comparability of earnings between periods 

the following table summarizes items of income expense that are included in net income loss and affect comparability of earnings between periods the items in the table below are explained on pages 38 through 41 



the following table presents the pretax amount of items affecting comparability of income expense by financial statement line item in the statement of consolidated income on page 57 the items in the table below are explained on pages 38 through 41 



reconciliations of gaap and nongaap measures 

the following table reconciles reported net income loss attributable to hess corporation and adjusted net income loss attributable to hess corporation 



the following table reconciles reported net cash provided by used in operating activities and net cash provided by used in operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities 



adjusted net income loss attributable to hess corporation is a nongaap financial measure which we define as reported net income loss attributable to hess corporation excluding items identified as affecting comparability of earnings between periods which are summarized on pages 38 through 41 management uses adjusted net income loss to evaluate the corporation’s operating performance and believes that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this measure which excludes certain items that management believes are not directly related to ongoing operations and are not indicative of future business trends and operations 

net cash provided by used in operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities presented in this report is a nongaap measure which we define as reported net cash provided by used in operating activities excluding changes in operating assets and liabilities management uses net cash provided by used in operating activities before changes in operating assets and 

liabilities to evaluate the corporation’s ability to internally fund capital expenditures pay dividends and service debt and believes that investors’ understanding of our ability to generate cash to fund these items is enhanced by disclosing this measure which excludes working capital and other movements that may distort assessment of our performance between periods 

these measures are not and should not be viewed as substitutes for us gaap net income loss and net cash provided by used in operating activities 

comparison of results 

exploration and production 

following is a summarized statement of income for our ep operations 



a commencing january 1 2019 management changed its measurement of segment earnings to reflect income taxes on a post us tax consolidation and valuation allowance assessment basis see footnote a in the table on page 87 for further details 

excluding the ep items affecting comparability of earnings between periods in the table on page 38 the changes in ep results are primarily attributable to changes in selling prices production and sales volumes marketing expenses cash operating costs midstream tariffs dda exploration expenses and income taxes as discussed below 

selling prices average worldwide realized crude oil selling prices including hedging were 22 lower in 2020 compared with the prior year primarily due to the decrease in brent and wti crude oil prices in addition realized worldwide selling prices for ngl decreased in 2020 by 16 and worldwide natural gas prices decreased in 2020 by 24 compared with the prior year in total lower realized selling prices decreased financial results by approximately 780 million after income taxes compared with 2019 our average selling prices were as follows 



a selling prices in the united states are adjusted for certain processing and distribution fees included in marketing expenses excluding these fees worldwide selling prices for 2020 would be 4754 per barrel for crude oil including hedging 2019  5995  2018 6377 3878 per barrel for crude oil excluding hedging 2019 5994 2018 6680 1129 per barrel for ngl 2019 1340 2018 2200 and 311 per mcf for natural gas 2019 397 2018 425 

b other includes our interests in denmark and libya 

c in august 2018 we sold our interests in the utica shale play onshore us 

crude oil hedging activities in 2020 were a net gain of 547 million before and after income taxes and a net gain of 1 million before and after income taxes in 2019 for 2021 we have wti put options with an average monthly floor price of 50 per barrel for 120000 bopd and brent put options with an average monthly floor price of 55 per barrel for 30000 bopd we expect put option premium amortization which will be reflected in realized selling prices to reduce our 2021 results by approximately 205 million 

production volumes our daily worldwide net production was as follows 



a in november 2020 we sold our working interest in the shenzi field in the deepwater gulf of mexico net production from the shenzi field was 9000 boepd for the year ended december 31 2020 2019 12000 boepd 2018 16000 boepd

net production variances related to 2020 and 2019 are summarized as follows 

united states north dakota net oil production was higher in 2020 primarily due to increased wells online and improved well performance north dakota net natural gas and ngl production was higher in 2020 due to increased wells online and improved well performance additional natural gas captured and processed and additional volumes received under percentage of proceeds contracts resulting from lower prices offshore net production was down in 2020 compared to 2019 due to the effect of increased hurricanerelated downtime and higher planned maintenance in 2020 and lower production from the shenzi field which was sold in november 2020 partially offset by initial production from the esox1 well which commenced in february of 2020 

international net crude oil production from guyana was higher in 2020 due to the startup of the liza phase 1 development in december 2019 while net crude oil production in libya was largely shut in during 2020 due to force majeure caused by civil unrest net natural gas production was lower from malaysia and jda due to covid19 impacts on economic activity in malaysia and thailand which reduced natural gas nominations from the buyers 

sales volumes higher sales volumes from our net production in 2020 improved aftertax results by approximately 130 million compared with 2019 net worldwide sales volumes from hess net production which excludes sales volumes of crude oil ngl and natural gas purchased from third parties were as follows 



a in 2020 63 million barrels of bakken crude oil were loaded on vlccs for sale in asian markets the first vlcc cargo of 21 million barrels was sold during the third quarter of 2020 and the remaining two vlcc cargos totaling 42 million barrels have been sold for delivery in the first quarter of 2021

cash operating costs cash operating costs consist of operating costs and expenses production and severance taxes and ep general and administrative expenses excluding items affecting comparability described in items affecting comparability of earnings between periods below cash operating costs decreased 159 million or 12 in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily from the impact of cost reduction initiatives and lower production and severance taxes associated with lower crude oil prices on a perunit basis cash operating costs improved 17 from 2019 reflecting lower costs and the impact of higher production volumes 

midstream tariffs expense tariffs expense increased from 2019 primarily due to higher throughput volumes and tariff rates in 2020 in 2021 we estimate midstream tariffs expense to be in the range of 1090 million to 1115 million 

dda dda expenses decreased by 62 million from 2019 primarily due to a lower portfolio average dda rate due in part to impairment charges in the first quarter of 2020 partially offset by higher production volumes dda expense on a perunit basis was lower in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to the yearoveryear mix of production and the impact of reduced dda rates for assets impaired in the first quarter of 2020 

unit costs unit cost per boe information is based on total ep net production volumes and excludes items affecting comparability of earnings as disclosed below actual and forecast unit costs are as follows

income taxes in 2020 income tax benefit was 12 million compared with expense of 375 million in 2019 primarily due to reduced activity in libya resulting from force majeure on operations for the majority of the year we are generally not recognizing deferred tax benefit or expense in certain countries primarily the us denmark and malaysia while we maintain valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets in these jurisdictions in accordance with the requirements of us accounting standards the valuation allowance established against the net deferred tax asset in guyana for the stabroek block was released as a result of the positive evidence from first production in december 2019 and the significant forecasted pretax income from operations the cumulative pretax losses in guyana were driven by preproduction activities see ep items affecting comparability of earnings between periods below

interest expense net was higher in 2020 due to interest incurred on the 10 billion three year term loan entered into in march 2020 and lower capitalized interest in 2021 aftertax interest expense net is estimated to be in the range of 380 million to 390 million 

items affecting comparability of earnings between periods corporate interest and other results included the following items affecting comparability of income expense 

2020 

• exit costs and other we included a pretax charge of 1 million 1 million after income taxes for employee termination benefits related to cost reduction initiatives 

2019 

• pension settlement we recorded a noncash pension settlement charge of 88 million 88 million after income taxes associated with the purchase of a single premium annuity contract by the hess corporation employees’ pension plan to settle and transfer certain of its obligations to a third party the charge is included in other net in the statement of consolidated income  

• income tax we recorded an allocation of noncash income tax expense of 86 million that was previously a component of accumulated other comprehensive income related to our 2019 crude oil hedge contracts 

2018 

• loss on debt extinguishment we recorded a pretax charge of 53 million 53 million after income taxes related to the premium paid for debt repurchases 

• exit costs and other we recorded a pretax charge of 58 million 58 million after income taxes resulting from the settlement of legal claims related to former downstream interests 

• income tax we recorded an allocation of noncash income tax benefit of 91 million to offset the recognition of a noncash income tax expense recorded in other comprehensive income resulting primarily from changes in fair value of our 2019 crude oil hedge contracts 

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table sets forth certain relevant measures of our liquidity and capital resources at december 31 



a includes 4 million of cash attributable to our midstream segment at december 31 2020 2019  3 million 

b includes 1910 million of debt outstanding from our midstream segment at december 31 2020 2019 1753 million that is nonrecourse to hess corporation 

c total consolidated debt of hess corporation including finance leases and excluding midstream nonrecourse debt as a percentage of total capitalization of hess corporation as defined under hess corporations term loan and revolving credit facility financial covenants total capitalization excludes the impact of noncash impairment charges and noncontrolling interests see note 7 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

cash flows 

the following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows 



operating activities  net cash provided by operating activities was 1333 million in 2020 2019 1642 million while net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities was 1803 million in 2020 2019 2237 million net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities decreased from 2019 primarily due to lower realized selling prices changes in operating assets and liabilities in 2020 reduced net cash provided by operating activities by 470 million primarily from a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities an increase in crude oil inventory resulting from our vlcc transactions and abandonment expenditures partially offset by lower receivables changes in operating 

assets and liabilities in 2019 reduced net cash provided by operating activities by 595 million primarily related to premiums on crude oil hedge contracts abandonment expenditures pension contributions and an increase in accounts receivable 

investing activities total additions to property plant and equipment were 2197 million in 2020 2019 2829 million the decrease primarily reflects lower drilling activity in the bakken partially offset by payments in the first quarter of 2020 to settle capital expenditures accrued in the fourth quarter of 2019 in 2019 midstream equity investments in its 5050 joint venture with targa resources were 33 million proceeds from asset sales were 493 million in 2020 2019 22 million 

financing activities borrowings in 2020 related to our 10 billion three year term loan while borrowings in 2019 related to our midstream operating segment repayments of debt were 8 million in 2019 net borrowings repayments of debt with maturities of 90 days or less related to our midstream operating segment revolving credit facilities common stock dividends paid were 309 million in 2020 compared to common and preferred dividends of 316 million in 2019 net cash outflows to noncontrolling interests were 261 million in 2020 2019 353 million 

future capital requirements and resources 

at december 31 2020 hess corporation had 174 billion in cash and cash equivalents excluding midstream and total liquidity including available committed credit facilities of approximately 54 billion our fully undrawn 35 billion committed revolving credit facility matures in may 2023 and we have no debt maturities until 2023 when the three year term loan matures 

net production in 2021 is forecast to be approximately 310000 boepd excluding libya and we expect our 2021 ep capital and exploratory expenditures will be approximately 19 billion for 2021 we have wti put options with an average monthly floor price of 50 per barrel for 120000 bopd and brent put options with an average monthly floor price of 55 per barrel for 30000 bopd 

in 2021 based on current forward strip crude oil prices we expect cash flow from operating activities proceeds from the first quarter 2021 sale of 42 million barrels of crude oil stored on two vlccs at yearend and cash and cash equivalents existing at december 31 2020 of 174 billion will be sufficient to fund our capital investment program and dividends due to the volatile commodity price environment we may take any of the following steps or a combination thereof to improve our liquidity and financial position reduce the planned capital program and other cash outlays including dividends pursue asset sales borrow against our committed revolving credit facility or issue debt or equity securities 

the table below summarizes the capacity usage and available capacity of our borrowing and letter of credit facilities at december 31 2020 



a committed and uncommitted lines have expiration dates through 2021 

b this credit facility may only be utilized by hesm opco and is nonrecourse to hess corporation 

hess corporation 

in 2020 we entered into a 1 billion three year term loan agreement with a maturity date of march 16 2023 borrowings under the term loan generally bear interest at libor plus an applicable margin of 225 until the term loans first anniversary the applicable margin varies based on the credit rating of the corporation’s senior unsecured longterm debt and will increase by 025 on each anniversary of the term loan 

in 2019 we entered into a new 35 billion revolving credit facility with a maturity date of may 15 2023 which replaced the corporation’s previous revolving credit facility the new facility can be used for borrowings and letters of credit borrowings will generally bear interest at 130 above libor though the interest rate is subject to adjustment if the corporation’s credit rating changes at december 31 2020 hess corporation had no outstanding borrowings or letters of credit under this facility 

the revolving credit facility and term loan are subject to customary representations warranties customary events of default and covenants including a financial covenant limiting the ratio of total consolidated debt to total capitalization of the corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries to 65 and a financial covenant limiting the ratio of secured debt to consolidated net tangible assets of 

the corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries to 15 as these capitalized terms are defined in the credit agreement for the revolving credit facility and the term loan agreement the indentures for the corporations fixedrate public notes limit the ratio of secured debt to consolidated net tangible assets as that term is defined in the indentures to 15 as of december 31 2020 hess corporation was in compliance with these financial covenants for additional information regarding the alteration or discontinuation of libor on our borrowing costs see financial risks in item 1a risk factors  

the most restrictive of the financial covenants related to our fixedrate public notes and our term loan and revolving credit facility would allow us to borrow up to an additional 1730 million of secured debt at december 31 2020 

we had 269 million in letters of credit outstanding at december 31 2020 2019 272 million which primarily relate to our international operations we have a shelf registration under which we may issue additional debt securities warrants common stock or preferred stock 

midstream 

at december 31 2020 hess midstream operations lp formerly hess midstream partners lp or hesm opco a consolidated subsidiary of hess midstream lp had 14 billion of senior secured syndicated credit facilities maturing december 16 2024 consisting of a 10 billion five year revolving credit facility and a fully drawn 400 million five year term loan a facility the revolving credit facility can be used for borrowings and letters of credit to fund hesm opco’s operating activities capital expenditures distributions and for other general corporate purposes borrowings under the five year term loan a facility will generally bear interest at libor plus an applicable margin ranging from 155 to 250 while the applicable margin for the five year syndicated revolving credit facility ranges from 1275 to 2000 pricing levels for the facility fee and interestrate margins are based on hesm opco’s ratio of total debt to ebitda as defined in the credit facilities if hesm opco obtains an investment grade credit rating the pricing levels will be based on hesm opco’s credit ratings in effect from time to time the credit facilities contain covenants that require hesm opco to maintain a ratio of total debt to ebitda as defined in the credit facilities for the prior four fiscal quarters of not greater than 500 to 100 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter 550 to 100 during the specified period following certain acquisitions and prior to hesm opco obtaining an investment grade credit rating a ratio of secured debt to ebitda for the prior four fiscal quarters of not greater than 400 to 100 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter hesm opco was in compliance with these financial covenants at december 31 2020 the credit facilities are secured by firstpriority perfected liens on substantially all the presently owned and afteracquired assets of hesm opco and its direct and indirect wholly owned material domestic subsidiaries including equity interests directly owned by such entities subject to certain customary exclusions at december 31 2020 borrowings of 184 million were drawn under hesm opco’s revolving credit facility and borrowings of 400 million excluding deferred issuance costs were drawn under hesm opco’s term loan a facility borrowings under these credit facilities are nonrecourse to hess corporation 

credit ratings 

two of the three major credit rating agencies that rate our debt have assigned an investment grade rating standard and poor’s ratings services affirmed our credit rating at bbb with negative outlook in october 2020 while fitch ratings affirmed a bbb credit rating and stable outlook in august 2020 moody’s investors service affirmed our credit rating at ba1 with stable outlook which is below investment grade in march 2020 

at december 31 2020 hesm opco’s senior unsecured debt is rated bb by standard and poor’s ratings services and fitch ratings and ba3 by moody’s investors service 

contractual obligations and contingencies 

the following table sets forth aggregate information about certain of the corporations consolidated contractual obligations at december 31 2020 



a we anticipate cash payments for interest on total debt of 440 million for 2021 850 million for 20222023 784 million for 20242025 and 3231 million thereafter for a total of 5305 million these interest payments reflect our contractual obligations at december 31 2020 

b comprises obligations including where we as operator have contracted directly with suppliers 

capital expenditures represent amounts for which we were contractually committed at december 31 2020 and include a portion of our planned capital expenditure program for 2021 obligations for operating expenses include commitments for oil and gas production expenses seismic purchases and other normal business expenses other liabilities reflect contractually committed obligations in the consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2020 including postretirement plan liabilities for our unfunded plans and estimates for uncertain income tax positions the corporation and certain of its subsidiaries primarily lease drilling rigs equipment logistical assets offshore vessels aircraft and shorebases and office space for varying periods see note 6  leases in the notes to consolidated financial statements  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

at december 31 2020 we had 269 million in letters of credit see also note 18 guarantees contingencies and commitments in the notes to consolidated financial statements  

foreign operations 

we conduct ep activities outside the us principally in guyana the joint development area of malaysiathailand malaysia denmark libya suriname and canada therefore we are subject to the risks associated with foreign operations including political risk tax law changes currency risk corruption and acts of terrorism see item 1a risk factors for further details 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

accounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and revenues and expenses in the statement of consolidated income  the accounting methods used can affect net income equity and various financial statement ratios however our accounting policies generally do not change cash flows or liquidity 

accounting for exploration and development costs ep activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage including lease bonuses brokers’ fees and other related costs are capitalized annual lease rentals exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred costs of drilling and equipping productive wells including development dry holes and related production facilities are capitalized 

the costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if 1 the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and 2 sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operational viability of the project if either of those criteria is not met or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project the capitalized well costs are charged to expense indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves and the economic and operating viability of a project include commitment of project personnel active negotiations for sales contracts with customers negotiations with governments operators and contractors and firm plans for additional drilling and other factors 

crude oil and natural gas reserves the determination of estimated proved reserves is a significant element in arriving at the results of operations of ep activities the estimates of proved reserves affect well capitalizations the unit of production depreciation rates of proved properties and wells and equipment as well as impairment testing of oil and gas assets 

for reserves to be booked as proved they must be determined with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations in addition government and project operator approvals must be obtained and depending on the amount of the project cost senior management or the board of directors must commit to fund the project we maintain our own internal reserve estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work directly with the oil and gas properties our technical staff update reserve estimates throughout the year based on evaluations of new wells performance reviews new technical data and other studies to provide consistency throughout the corporation standard reserve estimation guidelines definitions reporting reviews and approval practices are used the internal reserve estimates are subject to internal technical audits and senior management review we also engage an independent thirdparty consulting firm to audit approximately 80 of our total proved reserves each year 

proved reserves are calculated using the average price during the twelvemonth period ending december 31 determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the price on the first day of each month within the year unless prices are defined by contractual agreements excluding escalations based on future conditions as discussed in item 1a risk factors  crude oil prices are volatile which can have an impact on our proved reserves if crude oil prices in 2021 are at levels below that used in determining 2020 proved reserves we may recognize negative revisions to our december 31 2021 proved undeveloped reserves in addition we may recognize negative revisions to proved developed reserves which can vary significantly by asset due to differing operating cost structures conversely price increases in 2021 above those used in determining 2020 proved reserves could result in positive revisions to proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves at december 31 2021 it is difficult to estimate the magnitude of any potential net negative or positive change in proved reserves at december 31 2021 due to numerous currently unknown factors including 2021 crude oil prices the amount of any additions to proved reserves positive or negative revisions in proved reserves related to 2021 reservoir performance the levels to which industry costs will change in response to 2021 crude oil prices and management’s plans as of december 31 2021 for developing proved undeveloped reserves  a 10 change in proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves at december 31 2020 would result in an approximate 150 million pretax change in depreciation depletion and amortization expense for 2021 based on projected production volumes see the supplementary oil and gas data on pages 91 through 99 in the accompanying financial statements for additional information on our oil and gas reserves 

impairment of longlived assets we review long‑lived assets including oil and gas fields for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered long‑lived assets are tested based on identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities if the carrying amounts of the longlived assets are not expected to be recovered by estimated undiscounted future net cash flows the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded the amount of impairment is measured based on the estimated fair value of the assets generally determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows an income valuation approach or by a market‑based valuation approach which are level 3 fair value measurements 

in the case of oil and gas fields the present value of future net cash flows is based on management’s best estimate of future prices which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices applied to projected production volumes and discounted at a riskadjusted rate the projected production volumes represent reserves including probable reserves expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures the production volumes prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairment will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows since the standardized measure requires the use of historical twelvemonth average prices 

our impairment tests of longlived ep producing assets are based on our best estimates of future production volumes including recovery factors selling prices operating and capital costs the timing of future production and other factors which are updated each time an impairment test is performed as a result of the significant decline in crude oil prices due to the economic slowdown from the covid19 pandemic we reviewed our oil and gas fields and midstream operating segment asset groups for impairment at march 31 2020 we impaired various oil and gas fields located in malaysia denmark and the gulf of mexico in the first quarter of 2020 primarily as a result of a lower longterm crude oil price outlook see note 12 impairment in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further details we could experience an impairment in the future if one or a combination of the following occur the projected production volumes from oil and gas fields decrease crude oil and natural gas selling prices decline below the longterm crude oil price outlook used in the march 31 2020 impairment test or future estimated capital and operating costs increase significantly 

hess midstream lp we consolidate the activities of our interest in hess midstream lp  which qualifies as a variable interest entity vie under us generally accepted accounting principles we have concluded that we are the primary beneficiary of the vie as defined in the accounting standards since we have the power through hess corporation’s 47 consolidated ownership interest in hess midstream lp to direct those activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of hess midstream lp  and are obligated to absorb losses or have the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to hess midstream lp  this 

conclusion was based on a qualitative analysis that considered hess midstream lp ’s governance structure the commercial agreements between hess midstream lp and us and the voting rights established between the members which provide us the ability to control the operations of hess midstream lp  

income taxes judgments are required in the determination and recognition of income tax assets and liabilities in the financial statements these judgments include the requirement to recognize the financial statement effect of a tax position only when management believes it is more likely than not based on the technical merits that the position will be sustained upon examination 

we have net operating loss carryforwards or credit carryforwards in multiple jurisdictions and have recorded deferred tax assets for those losses and credits additionally we have deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized if when tested under the relevant accounting standards it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized 

the accounting standards require the evaluation of all available positive and negative evidence giving weight based on the evidence’s relative objectivity in evaluating potential sources of positive evidence we consider the reversal of taxable temporary differences taxable income in carryback and carryforward periods the availability of tax planning strategies the existence of appreciated assets estimates of future taxable income and other factors estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas reserves selling prices and other subjective operating assumptions that are consistent with internal business forecasts in evaluating potential sources of negative evidence we consider a cumulative loss in recent years any history of operating losses or tax credit carryforwards expiring unused losses expected in early future years unsettled circumstances that if unfavorably resolved would adversely affect future operations and profit levels on a continuing basis in future years and any carryback or carryforward period so brief that a significant deductible temporary difference expected to reverse in a single year would limit realization of tax benefits due to a sustained low commodity price environment we remained in a threeyear cumulative consolidated loss position at december 31 2020 a threeyear cumulative consolidated loss constitutes objective negative evidence to which the accounting standards require we assign significant weight relative to subjective evidence such as our estimates of future taxable income we are generally not recognizing deferred tax benefit or expense in certain countries primarily the us denmark and malaysia while we maintain valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets in these jurisdictions in december 2019 we reversed the valuation allowance of 60 million for guyana upon achieving first production from the liza phase 1 development 

at december 31 2020 the consolidated balance sheet reflects a 5391 million valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets for multiple jurisdictions based on the evaluation of the accounting standards described above the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable however could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income change or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight is given to subjective evidence such as expected future growth 

asset retirement obligations we have material legal obligations to remove and dismantle long‑lived assets and to restore land or seabed at certain ep locations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we recognize a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations in addition the fair value of any legally required conditional asset retirement obligation is recorded if the liability can be reasonably estimated we capitalize such costs as a component of the carrying amount of the underlying assets in the period in which the liability is incurred in subsequent periods the liability is accreted and the asset is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset we estimate the fair value of these obligations by discounting projected future payments that will be required to satisfy the obligations in determining these estimates we are required to make several assumptions and judgments related to the scope of dismantlement timing of settlement interpretation of legal requirements inflationary factors and discount rate in addition there are other external factors which could significantly affect the ultimate settlement costs or timing for these obligations including changes in environmental regulations and other statutory requirements fluctuations in industry costs and foreign currency exchange rates and advances in technology as a result our estimates of asset retirement obligations are subject to revision due to the factors described above changes in estimates prior to settlement result in adjustments to both the liability and related asset values unless the field has ceased production in which case changes are recognized in our consolidated statement of income  see note 8 asset retirement obligations  

retirement plans we have funded noncontributory defined benefit pension plans an unfunded supplemental pension plan and an unfunded postretirement medical plan we recognize the net change in the funded status of the projected benefit obligation for these plans in the consolidated balance sheet  the determination of the obligations and expenses related to these plans are based on several actuarial assumptions these assumptions represent estimates made by us some of which can be affected by external factors the most significant assumptions relate to 

discount rates used for measuring the present value of future plan obligations and net periodic benefit cost the discount rates used to estimate our projected benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost is based on a portfolio of high‑quality fixed income debt instruments with maturities that approximate the expected payment of plan obligations at december 31 2020 a 025 decrease in the discount rate assumptions would increase projected benefit obligations by approximately 145 million and would decrease forecasted 2021 annual net periodic benefit income by approximately 10 million the increase in the projected benefit obligations 

would decrease the funded status of our pension plans but any decrease in the funded status would be partially mitigated by increases in the fair value of fixed income investments in the asset portfolios 

expected longterm rates of returns on plan assets the expected return on plan assets is developed from the expected future returns for each asset category weighted by the target allocation of plan assets to that asset category the future expected return assumptions for individual asset categories are largely based on inputs from various investment experts regarding their future return expectations for particular asset categories at december 31 2020 a 025 decrease in the expected longterm rates of return on plan assets assumption would decrease forecasted 2021 annual net periodic benefit income by approximately 10 million 

other assumptions include the rate of future increases in compensation levels and expected participant mortality 

derivatives we utilize derivative instruments including futures forwards options and swaps individually or in combination to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in the prices of crude oil and natural gas as well as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates all derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet  our policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative the changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized currently in earnings derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions cash flow hedges or hedges of changes in fair value of recognized assets and liabilities or of unrecognized firm commitments fair value hedges changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income loss amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings the change in fair value of the related hedged item is recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized currently in earnings 

fair value measurements we use various valuation approaches in determining fair value for financial instruments including the market and income approaches our fair value measurements also include nonperformance risk and time value of money considerations counterparty credit is considered for receivable balances and our credit is considered for accrued liabilities 

we also record certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value when required by generally accepted accounting principles these fair value measurements are recorded in connection with business combinations qualifying nonmonetary exchanges the initial recognition of asset retirement obligations and any impairment of longlived assets equity method investments or goodwill 

we determine fair value in accordance with the fair value measurements accounting standard which established a hierarchy for the inputs used to measure fair value based on the source of the inputs which generally range from quoted prices for identical instruments in a principal trading market level 1 to estimates determined using related market data level 3 including discounted cash flows and other unobservable data measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered level 2 when level 1 inputs are available within a particular market those inputs are selected for determination of fair value over level 2 or 3 inputs in the same market multiple inputs may be used to measure fair value however the level assigned to a fair value measurement is based on the lowest significant input level within this fair value hierarchy 

environment health and safety 

our longterm vision and values provide a foundation for how we do business and define our commitment to meeting high standards of corporate citizenship and creating a long lasting positive impact on the communities where we do business our strategy is reflected in our ehs  sr policies and by a management system framework that helps protect our workforce customers and local communities our management systems are intended to promote internal consistency adherence to policy objectives and continual improvement in ehs  sr performance improved performance may in the short‑term increase our operating costs and could also require increased capital expenditures to reduce potential risks to our assets reputation and license to operate in addition to enhanced ehs  sr performance improved productivity and operational efficiencies may be realized from investments in ehs  sr we have programs in place to evaluate regulatory compliance audit facilities train employees prevent and manage risks and emergencies and to generally meet corporate ehs  sr goals and objectives 

environmental matters 

we recognize that climate change is a global environmental concern we assess monitor and take measures to reduce our carbon footprint at existing and planned operations the epa has adopted a series of ghg monitoring reporting and emissions control rules for the oil and natural gas industry and the us congress has from time to time considered adopting further legislation to reduce ghg emissions in addition states have taken measures to reduce emissions of ghgs primarily through the development of ghg emission inventories andor regional ghg capandtrade programs at the international level the paris agreement on climate change aimed to enhance global response to global temperature changes and to reduce ghg emissions among other things we are committed to complying with all ghg emissions regulations that apply to our operations including those related to venting or flaring of natural gas and the responsible management of ghg emissions at our facilities while we monitor climaterelated regulatory initiatives and international public policy issues the current state of ongoing international climate initiatives and any related domestic 

actions make it difficult to assess the timing or effect on our operations or to predict with certainty the future costs that we may incur in order to comply with future international treaties legislation or new regulations however future restrictions on emissions of ghgs or related measures to encourage use of low carbon energy could result in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us and the oil and gas industry in general and may reduce demand for our products as described under regulatory legal and environmental risks in item 1a risk factors  

we will have continuing expenditures for environmental assessment and remediation sites where corrective action may be necessary include ep facilities sites from discontinued operations where we retained liability and although not currently significant epa “superfund” sites where we have been named a potentially responsible party we accrue for environmental assessment and remediation expenses when the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable for additional information see item 3 legal proceedings  at december 31 2020 our reserve for estimated remediation liabilities was approximately 65 million we expect that existing reserves for environmental liabilities will adequately cover costs to assess and remediate known sites our remediation spending was approximately 15 million in 2020 2019 20 million 2018 15 million the amount of other expenditures incurred to comply with federal state local and foreign country environmental regulations is difficult to quantify as such costs are captured as mostly indistinguishable components of our capital expenditures and operating expenses 

health and safety matters 

the crude oil and natural gas industry is regulated at federal state local and foreign government levels regarding the health and safety of ep operations such laws and regulations relate to among other matters occupational safety the use of hydraulic fracturing to stimulate crude oil and natural gas production well control and integrity process safety and equipment integrity and may include permitting and disclosure requirements operating restrictions and other conditions on the development of crude oil and natural gas the level of our expenditures to comply with federal state local and foreign country health and safety regulations is difficult to quantify as such costs are captured as mostly indistinguishable components of our capital expenditures and operating expenses while compliance with laws and regulations relating to health and safety matters increases the overall cost of business for us and the oil and gas industry in general it has not had to date a material adverse effect on our operations financial condition or results of operations 

occupational safety  we are subject to the requirements set forth under federal workplace standards by the osha and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers under osha and other federal and state occupational safety and health laws and laws of foreign countries in which we operate we must develop maintain and disclose certain information about hazardous materials used released or produced in our operations 

production and well integrity  our us onshore production facilities are subject to us federal government state and local regulations regarding the use of hydraulic fracturing and well control and integrity our offshore production facilities in the gulf of mexico are subject to the us federal government’s safety and environmental management system regulations which provide a systematic approach for identifying managing and mitigating hazards adapting to new technical standards and procedures in production and in our well integrity management system is fundamental to our aim of protecting the environment as well as the health and safety of our workforce and the communities in which we operate and to safeguarding our product 

process safety and equipment integrity  we are also regulated at federal state local and foreign government levels regarding process safety and the integrity of our equipment including osha’s process safety management of highly hazardous chemicals standard ice are barriers and safeguards that prevent or mitigate process safety incidents through detection isolation containment control or emergency preparedness and response within our facilities we have established ice performance standards which set specific requirements and criteria for inspections and tests that help to ensure ice barriers are effective we conduct assessments collaboratively with our operated assets subject matter experts and technical authorities to evaluate compliance with corporate and asset environment health and safety standards and procedures as well as with applicable regulations for additional information on our emergency response and incident mitigation activities see emergency preparedness and response plans and procedures in items 1 and 2 business and properties  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of our business we are exposed to commodity risks related to changes in the prices of crude oil ngl and natural gas as well as changes in interest rates and foreign currency values in the disclosures that follow financial risk management activities refer to the mitigation of these risks through hedging activities 

controls we maintain a control environment under the direction of our chief risk officer controls over instruments used in financial risk management activities include volumetric and term limits our treasury department is responsible for administering and monitoring foreign exchange rate and interest rate hedging programs using similar controls and processes where applicable hedging strategies are reviewed annually by the audit committee of the board of directors 

instruments we primarily use forward commodity contracts foreign exchange forward contracts futures swaps and options in our risk management activities these contracts are generally widely traded instruments with standardized terms the following describes these instruments and how we use them 

• swaps we use financially settled swap contracts with third parties as part of our financial risk management activities cash flows from swap contracts are determined based on underlying commodity prices or interest rates and are typically settled over the life of the contract 

• forward foreign exchange contracts we enter into forward contracts primarily for the british pound danish krone canadian dollar and malaysian ringgit which commit us to buy or sell a fixed amount of those currencies at a predetermined exchange rate on a future date 

• exchangetraded contracts we may use exchangetraded contracts including futures on a number of different underlying energy commodities these contracts are settled daily with the relevant exchange and may be subject to exchange position limits 

• options options on various underlying energy commodities include exchangetraded and thirdparty contracts and have various exercise periods as a seller of options we receive a premium at the outset and bear the risk of unfavorable changes in the price of the commodity underlying the option as a purchaser of options we pay a premium at the outset and have the right to participate in the favorable price movements in the underlying commodities 

financial risk management activities 

we have outstanding foreign exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling 163 million at december 31 2020 that are used to reduce our exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates for various currencies the change in fair value of foreign exchange contracts from a 10 strengthening or weakening in the us dollar exchange rate is estimated to be a gain or loss of less than 5 million respectively at december 31 2020 

at december 31 2020 our total longterm debt which was substantially comprised of fixedrate instruments had a carrying value of 8296 million and a fair value of 9647 million a 15 increase or decrease in interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of debt by approximately 400 million or 430 million respectively any changes in interest rates do not impact our cash outflows associated with fixedrate interest payments or settlement of debt principal unless a debt instrument is repurchased prior to maturity 

at december 31 2020 we had wti put options with an average monthly floor price of approximately 45 per barrel for 75000 bopd for 2021 as of december 31 2020 an assumed 10 increase in the forward wti crude oil prices used in determining the fair value of our wti put options would reduce the fair value of these derivative instruments by approximately 20 million while an assumed 10 decrease in the same crude oil prices would increase the fair value of these derivative instruments by approximately 30 million in the first quarter of 2021 we increased the average monthly floor price of 75000 bopd of wti put option contracts from approximately 45 per barrel to 50 per barrel for the remainder of 2021 we also purchased additional wti put options with an average monthly floor price of 50 per barrel for 45000 bopd and brent put options with an average monthly floor price of 55 per barrel for 30000 bopd as a result we now have total purchased wti put options of 120000 bopd with an average monthly floor price of 50 per barrel and total purchased brent put options of 30000 bopd with an average monthly floor price of 55 per barrel for the remainder of 2021 

we have outstanding brent crude oil swap contracts associated with the 42 million barrels stored on two vlccs at yearend as of december 31 2020 an assumed 10 increase in the forward brent crude oil prices used in determining the fair value of our brent swaps would reduce the fair value of these derivative instruments by approximately 20 million while an assumed 10 decrease in the same crude oil prices would increase the fair value of these derivative instruments by approximately 20 million

production 

worldwide crude oil ngl and natural gas net production was as follows



 



 







 

 

 

 

ep operations 

at december 31 2019 our significant ep assets included the following

united states 

our production in the us was from onshore properties principally in the bakken shale play in the williston basin of north dakota bakken and from offshore properties in the gulf of mexico

onshore

bakken at december 31 2019 we held approximately 534000 operated net acres in the bakken with varying working interest percentages net production averaged 152000 boepd in 2019 during the year we operated six rigs drilled 160 wells and brought 156 wells on production bringing the total operated production wells to 1575 by yearend effective 2019 all new production wells use plug and perf completions we were able to reduce the average cost of a plug and perf well in 2019 to 68 million per well from 76 million in 2018   

during 2020 we plan to operate six rigs drill approximately 170 wells and bring approximately 175 wells on production w e forecast net production to average approximately 180000 boepd in 2020 and to reach approximately 200000 boepd by the end of 2020 in the third quarter of 2020 the tioga gas plant will be shut down for approximately 45 days for a planned turnaround and tiein of the plant expansion project which will increase gas processing capacity to 400 million cubic feet per day from 250 million cubic feet per day and is expected to be in service by mid2021 the shutdown for the turnaround is expected to reduce 2020 average net production mostly natural gas liquids and natural gas by approximately 6000 boepd commencing in 2021 we plan to reduce our rig count to four operated rigs and at this level of activity expect to hold net production relatively flat at approximately 200000 boepd for at least five years

offshore

gulf of mexico at december 31 2019 we held approximately 73000 net developed acres with our production operations principally at the baldpate hess 50 conger hess 38 hack wilson hess 25 llano hess 50 penn state hess 50 shenzi hess 28 stampede hess 25 and tubular bells hess 57 fields at december 31 2019 we held approximately 344000 net undeveloped acres of which leases covering approximately 81000 acres are due to expire in the next three years 

in 2019 the corporation announced a discovery at the hess operated esox1 exploration well in mississippi canyon block no 726 hess 57 first production from the well was achieved in february 2020 as a tieback to the tubular bells production facilities in 2020 we expect to drill up to two exploration wells in the gulf of mexico 

guyana

stabroek block the stabroek block hess 30 offshore guyana covers approximately 66 million acres which is equivalent to approximately 1150 gulf of mexico blocks the operator esso exploration and production guyana limited has made sixteen significant discoveries since 2015 the discovered resources to date on the stabroek block are expected to underpin the potential for at least five fpsos producing more than 750000 gross bopd by 2025 

under the terms of our agreement with the government the contractors collectively affiliates of exxonmobil – 45 hess – 30 and cnooc – 25 are generally entitled to recover contract costs for exploration development and production activities within the stabroek block cost recovery in an amount up to 75 of gross production in any month with any excess cost recovery carried over to future periods all production not allocated to cost recovery in a given month profit oil is further allocated 50 to the government and 50 to the contractors the contractors must also pay a royalty of 2 based on gross production either in cash or inkind at the election of the government our resulting entitlement is 30 of the contractors’ share of production 

the liza phase 1 development which was sanctioned in 2017 began producing oil in december 2019 from the liza destiny fpso production is expected to ramp up to the full capacity of 120000 gross bopd in 2020 w e forecast net production for 2020 to average approximately 25000 bopd 

the liza phase 2 development was sanctioned in 2019 and will utilize the liza unity fpso to produce up to 220000 gross bopd with first production expected by early 2022 six drill centers are planned with a total of 30 wells including 15 production wells nine water injection wells and six gas injection wells in 2020 the operator plans to commence development drilling installation of subsea flow lines and equipment and installation of topside facilities modules on the liza unity fpso 

a third development at the payara field is expected to be sanctioned following government and regulatory approvals and is expected to produce up to 220000 gross bopd with startup as early as 2023 i n addition to the first three developments planning is underway for 

 

 

 

 

additional fpsos the ultimate sizing and timing of these potential developments will be a function of further exploration and appraisal drilling 

the operator is currently utilizing four drillships for exploration appraisal and development drilling activities and intends to bring in a fifth drillship in 2020 

in 2019 the following exploration and appraisal wells were drilled on the stabroek block in chronological order

tilapia the tilapia  1 well encountered approximately 305 feet of highquality oilbearing sandstone reservoir and is located approximately 34 miles west of the longtail1 well

yellowtail  the yellowtail  1 well encountered approximately 292 feet of highquality oilbearing sandstone reservoir and is located approximately 6 miles northwest of the tilapia discovery 

hammerhead  the hammerhead  2 well located approximately 09 miles from the hammerhead  1 discovery well and the hammerhead  3 well located approximately 19 miles from hammerhead  1 were both successfully drilled and encountered high quality oilbearing sandstone reservoir a drill stem test was also performed on hammerhead  3 results are under evaluation 

tripletail  the tripletail  1 well encountered approximately 108 feet of highquality oilbearing sandstone reservoir and is located approximately 3 miles northeast of the longtail discovery additional oilbearing reservoirs were subsequently encountered below the previously announced tripletail discovery which are still under evaluation 

ranger the ranger2 appraisal well was completed and a drill stem test was performed results are under evaluation 

mako  the mako  1 well encountered approximately 164 feet of highquality oilbearing sandstone reservoir and is located approximately 6 miles southeast of the liza field 

in january 2020 the operator announced the sixteenth discovery on the stabroek block at the uaru  1 well the uaru1 well encountered approximately 94 feet of highquality oilbearing sandstone reservoir and is located approximately 10 miles northeast of the liza field the operator’s plans for 2020 exploration and appraisal drilling activities include focusing the first half of the year primarily on appraisal of discoveries in the greater turbot area and the second half of the year to include the drilling of several exploration wells which is expected to include further tests of emerging deeper plays on the stabroek block 

kaieteur block in 2018 we acquired a participating interest in the kaieteur block hess 15 which is adjacent to the stabroek block the operator esso exploration and production guyana limited completed a 2d seismic shoot in 2019 and expects to drill the tanager1 exploration well in 2020

emergency preparedness and response plans and procedures

we have in place a series of business and assetspecific emergency preparedness response and business continuity plans that detail procedures for rapid and effective emergency response and environmental mitigation activities these plans are maintained reviewed and updated as necessary to confirm their accuracy and suitability where applicable they are also reviewed and approved by the relevant host government authorities

responder training and drills are routinely held worldwide to assess and continually improve the effectiveness of our plans our contractors service providers representatives from government agencies and where applicable joint venture partners participate in the drills to help ensure that emergency procedures are comprehensive and can be effectively implemented

to complement internal capabilities and to help ensure coverage for our global operations we maintain membership contracts with a network of local regional and global oil spill response and emergency response organizations at the regional and global level these organizations include clean gulf associates cga marine spill response corporation msrc marine well containment company mwcc wild well control wwc and oil spill response limited osrl cga and msrc are domestic spill response organizations and mwcc provides the equipment and personnel to contain underwater well control incidents in the gulf of mexico 

 

 

 

 

wwc provides firefighting well control and engineering services globally osrl is a global response organization and is available when needed to assist us with any of our assets in addition to owning response assets in their own right the organization maintains business relationships that provide immediate access to additional critical response support services if required osrl’s response assets include nearly 300 recovery and storage vessels and barges more than 250 skimmers over 600000 feet of boom 9 capping stacks and significant quantities of dispersants and other ancillary equipment including aircraft in addition to external well control and oil spill response support we have contracts with wildlife environmental meteorology incident management medical and security resources if we were to engage these organizations to obtain additional critical response support services we would fund such services and where appropriate seek reimbursement under our insurance coverage as described below in certain circumstances we pursue and enter into mutual aid agreements with other companies and government cooperatives to receive and provide oil spill response equipment and personnel support we maintain close associations with emergency response organizations through our representation on the executive committees of cga and msrc as well as the board of directors of osrl 

we continue to participate in several industrywide task forces that are studying better ways to assess the risk of and prevent onshore and offshore incidents access and control blowouts in subsea environments and improve containment and recovery methods the task forces are working closely with the oil and gas industry and international government agencies to implement improvements and increase the effectiveness of oil spill prevention preparedness response and recovery processes

insurance coverage and indemnification

we maintain insurance coverage that includes coverage for physical damage to our property thirdparty liability workers’ compensation and employers’ liability general liability sudden and accidental pollution and other coverage this insurance coverage is subject to deductibles exclusions and limitations and there is no assurance that such coverage will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences and damages 

the amount of insurance covering physical damage to our property and liability related to negative environmental effects resulting from a sudden and accidental pollution event excluding atlantic named windstorm coverage for which we are self‑insured varies by asset based on the assets estimated replacement value or the estimated maximum loss in the case of a catastrophic event first party coverage consists of two tiers of insurance the first 400 million of coverage is provided through an industry mutual insurance group above this 400 million threshold insurance is carried which ranges in value up to 131 billion in total depending on the asset coverage level as described above the insurance programs covering physical damage to our property exclude business interruption protection for our ep operations additionally we carry insurance that provides thirdparty coverage for general liability and sudden and accidental pollution up to 108 billion which coverage under a standard joint operating arrangement would be reduced to our participating interest our insurance policies renew at various dates each year future insurance coverage could increase in cost and may include higher deductibles or retentions or additional exclusions or limitations in addition some forms of insurance may become unavailable in the future or unavailable on terms that are deemed economically acceptable 

generally our drilling contracts and most of our other offshore services contracts provide for a mutual hold harmless indemnity structure whereby each party to the contract the corporation and contractor indemnifies the other party for injuries or damages to their personnel and property and often those of its contractorssubcontractors regardless of fault variations may include indemnity exclusions to the extent a claim is attributable to the gross negligence andor willful misconduct of a party third‑party claims on the other hand are generally allocated on a fault basis

we are customarily responsible for and indemnify the contractor against all claims including those from third parties to the extent attributable to pollution or contamination by substances originating from our reservoirs or other property and the contractor is responsible for and indemnifies us for all claims attributable to pollution emanating from the contractor’s property variations may include indemnity exclusions to the extent a claim is attributable to the gross negligence andor willful misconduct of a party additionally we are generally liable for all of our own losses and most third‑party claims associated with catastrophic losses such as damage to reservoirs blowouts cratering and loss of hole regardless of cause although exceptions for losses attributable to gross negligence andor willful misconduct do exist lastly some offshore services contracts include overall limitations of the contractor’s liability equal to a fixed negotiated amount variations may include exclusions of all contractual indemnities from the liability cap

under a standard joint operating agreement joa each party is liable for all claims arising under the joa to the extent of its participating interest operator or nonoperator variations include indemnity exclusions when the claim is based upon the gross negligence andor willful misconduct of the operator in which case the operator is solely liable the parties to the joa may continue to be jointly and severally liable for claims made by third parties in some jurisdictions further under some production sharing contracts between a governmental entity and commercial parties liability of the commercial parties to the government entity is joint and several

 

 

 

 

environmental 

compliance with various existing environmental and pollution control regulations imposed by federal state local and foreign governments is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations but increasingly stringent environmental regulations have resulted and will likely continue to result in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us and the oil and gas industry in general we spent approximately 20 million in 2019 for environmental remediation the level of other expenditures to comply with federal state local and foreign country environmental regulations is difficult to quantify as such costs are captured as mostly indistinguishable components of our capital expenditures and operating expenses for further discussion of environmental matters see environment health and safety in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

 item 1a risk factors 

our business activities and the value of our securities are subject to significant risks including the risk factors described below these risk factors could negatively affect our operations financial condition liquidity and results of operations and as a result holders and purchasers of our securities could lose part or all of their investments it is possible that additional risks relating to our securities may be described in a prospectus supplement if we issue securities in the future

our business and operating results are highly dependent on the market prices of crude oil ngl and natural gas which can be very volatile our estimated proved reserves revenue operating cash flows operating margins liquidity financial condition and future earnings are highly dependent on the benchmark market prices of crude oil ngl and natural gas and our associated realized price differentials which are volatile and influenced by numerous factors beyond our control the major foreign oil producing countries including members of opec may exert considerable influence over the supply and price of crude oil and refined petroleum products their ability to agree on a common policy on rates of production and other matters may have a significant impact on the oil markets other factors include but are not limited to worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for crude oil ngl and natural gas political conditions and events including instability changes in governments armed conflict economic sanctions and outbreaks of infectious diseases around the world and in particular in crude oil or natural gas producing regions the cost of exploring for developing and producing crude oil ngl and natural gas the price and availability of alternative fuels or other forms of energy the effect of energy conservation and environmental protection efforts and overall economic conditions globally the sentiment of commodities trading markets as well as other supply and demand factors may also influence the selling prices of crude oil ngl and natural gas average benchmark prices for 2019 were 5704 per barrel for wti 2018 6490 2017 5085 and 6416 per barrel for brent 2018 7169 2017 5474 in order to manage the potential volatility of cash flows and credit requirements we maintain significant bank credit facilities an inability to access renew or replace such credit facilities or access other sources of funding as they mature would negatively impact our liquidity furthermore from time to time we have entered into and may in the future enter into or modify commodity price hedging arrangements to manage commodity price volatility these arrangements may limit potential upside from commodity price increases or expose us to additional risks such as counterparty credit risk which could adversely impact our cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

if we fail to successfully increase our reserves our future crude oil and natural gas production will be adversely impacted we own or have access to a finite amount of oil and gas reserves which will be depleted over time replacement of oil and gas production and reserves including proved undeveloped reserves is subject to successful exploration drilling development activities and enhanced recovery programs therefore future oil and gas production is dependent on technical success in finding and developing additional hydrocarbon reserves exploration activity involves the interpretation of seismic and other geological and geophysical data which does not always successfully predict the presence of commercial quantities of hydrocarbons drilling risks include unexpected adverse conditions irregularities in pressure or formations equipment failure blowouts and weather interruptions future developments may be affected by unforeseen reservoir conditions which negatively affect recovery factors or flow rates similar risks may be encountered in the production of oil and gas on properties acquired from others in addition replacing reserves and developing future production are also influenced by the price of crude oil and natural gas and costs of drilling and development activities lower crude oil and natural gas prices may reduce capital available for our exploration and development activities render certain development projects uneconomic or delay their completion and result in negative revisions to existing reserves while increasing drilling and development costs could negatively affect expected economic returns 

there are inherent uncertainties in estimating quantities of proved reserves and discounted future net cash flows and actual quantities may be lower than estimated numerous uncertainties exist in estimating quantities of proved reserves and future net revenues from those reserves actual future production oil and gas prices revenues taxes capital expenditures operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates and could materially affect the estimated quantities of our proved reserves and the related future net revenues in addition reserve estimates may be subject to downward or upward changes based on production performance purchases or sales of properties results of future development prevailing oil and gas prices production sharing contracts which may decrease reserves as crude oil and natural gas prices increase and other factors crude oil prices declined in 2019 relative to 2018 resulting in reductions to our reported proved reserves in contrast crude oil prices improved in 2017 and 2018 relative to preceding years resulting in increases to our reported proved reserves if crude oil prices in 2020 average below prices used to determine proved reserves at december 31 2019 it could have an adverse effect on our estimates of proved reserve volumes and on the value of our business see crude oil and natural gas reserves in critical accounting policies and estimates in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

 

 

 

catastrophic and other events whether naturally occurring or man ‑made may materially affect our operations and financial condition our oil and gas operations are subject to numerous risks and hazards inherent to operating in the crude oil and natural gas industry including catastrophic events which may damage or destroy assets interrupt operations result in personal injury and have other significant adverse effects these events include unexpected drilling conditions pressure conditions or irregularities in reservoir formations equipment malfunctions or failures fires explosions blowouts cratering pipeline interruptions and ruptures hurricanes severe weather geological events shortages in availability of skilled labor or cyber ‑attacks we maintain insurance coverage against many but not all potential losses and liabilities in amounts we deem prudent including for property and casualty losses there can be no assurance that such insurance will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences and damages moreover some forms of insurance may be unavailable in the future or be available only on terms that are deemed economically unacceptable 

we do not always control decisions made under joint operating agreements and the parties under such agreements may fail to meet their obligations we conduct many of our ep operations through joint operating agreements with other parties under which we may not control decisions either because we do not have a controlling interest or are not operator under the agreement there is risk that these parties may at any time have economic business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours and therefore decisions may be made which are not what we believe is in our best interest moreover parties to these agreements may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone in either case the value of our investment may be adversely affected 

we are subject to changing laws and regulations and other governmental actions that can significantly and adversely affect our business political or regulatory developments and governmental actions including federal state local territorial and foreign laws and regulations relating to tax increases and retroactive tax claims disallowance of tax credits and deductions expropriation or nationalization of property mandatory government participation cancellation or amendment of contract rights imposition of capital controls or blocking of funds changes in import and export regulations reduction of sulfur content in bunker fuel the imposition of tariffs limitations on access to exploration and development opportunities prohibition on hydraulic fracturing of wells and antibribery or anticorruption laws may adversely affect our operations and those of our counterparties with whom we have contracted which may affect our financial results 

we have substantial capital requirements and we may not be able to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms the exploration development and production of crude oil and natural gas involve substantial costs which may not be fully funded from operations two of the three major credit rating agencies that rate our debt have assigned an investment grade rating although currently we do not have any borrowings under our longterm credit facility a ratings downgrade continued weakness in the oil and gas industry or negative outcomes within commodity and financial markets could adversely impact our access to capital markets by increasing the costs of financing or by impacting our ability to obtain financing on satisfactory terms in addition a ratings downgrade may require that we issue letters of credit or provide other forms of collateral under certain contractual requirements any inability to access capital markets could adversely impact our financial adaptability and our ability to execute our strategy and may also expose us to heightened exposure to credit risk in addition borrowings on credit facilities may use libor as a benchmark for establishing the rate libor is the subject of recent national international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform these reforms and other pressures may cause libor to be discontinued or to perform differently than in the past the consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted but could include fluctuations in interest rates or an increase in the cost of credit facility borrowings 

political instability in areas where we operate can adversely affect our business some of the international areas in which we operate are politically less stable than other areas and may be subject to civil unrest conflict insurgency corruption security risks and labor unrest political instability and civil unrest in north africa south america and the middle east has affected and may continue to affect our interests in these areas as well as oil and gas markets generally in addition geographic territorial border disputes may affect our business in certain areas such as the border dispute between guyana and venezuela over a portion of the stabroek block political instability exposes our operations to increased risks including increased difficulty in obtaining required permits and government approvals enforcing our agreements in those jurisdictions and potential adverse actions by local government authorities the threat of terrorism around the world also poses additional risks to our operations and the operations of the oil and gas industry in general 

our oil and gas operations are subject to environmental risks and environmental laws and regulations that can result in significant costs and liabilities our oil and gas operations are subject to environmental risks such as oil spills produced water spills gas leaks and ruptures and discharges of substances or gases that could expose us to substantial liability for pollution or other environmental damage our operations are also subject to numerous us federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations non‑compliance with these laws and regulations may subject us to administrative civil or criminal penalties remedial cleanups natural resource damages and other liabilities in addition increasingly stringent environmental regulations have resulted and will likely continue to result in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us similarly we have material legal obligations to dismantle remove and abandon production facilities and wells that will 

 

 

 

occur many years in the future in most cases these estimates may be impacted by future changes in regulations and other uncertainties 

concerns have been raised in certain jurisdictions where we have operations concerning the safety and environmental impact of the drilling and development of shale oil and gas resources particularly hydraulic fracturing water usage flaring of associated natural gas and air emissions while we believe that these operations can be conducted safely and with minimal impact on the environment regulatory bodies are responding to these concerns and may impose moratoriums and new regulations on such drilling operations that would likely have the effect of prohibiting or delaying such operations and increasing their cost

climate change and sustainability initiatives may result in significant operational changes and expenditures reduced demand for our products and adversely affect our business we recognize that climate change and sustainability is a growing global environmental concern continuing political and social attention to the issue of climate change and sustainability has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national regional or local legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions these agreements and measures may require or could result in future legislation and regulatory measures that require significant equipment modifications operational changes taxes or purchase of emission credits to reduce emission of greenhouse gases from our operations which may result in substantial capital expenditures and compliance operating maintenance and remediation costs in addition our production is sold to third parties that produce petroleum fuels which through normal end user consumption result in the emission of greenhouse gases as a result of heightened public awareness and attention to climate change and sustainability as well as continued regulatory initiatives to reduce the use of these fuels demand for crude oil and other hydrocarbons may be reduced which may have an adverse effect on our sales volumes revenues and margins the imposition and enforcement of stringent greenhouse gas emissions reduction requirements could severely and adversely impact the oil and gas industry and therefore significantly reduce the value of our business in addition certain financial institutions institutional investors and other sources of capital have begun to limit or eliminate their investment in oil and gas activities due to concerns about climate change which could make it more difficult to finance our business furthermore increasing attention to climate change risks and sustainability has resulted in governmental investigations and public and private litigation which could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business for example in 2017 certain municipalities and private associations in california rhode island and maryland separately filed lawsuits against over 30 fossil fuel producers including us for alleged damages purportedly caused by climate change 

our industry is highly competitive and many of our competitors are larger and have greater resources and more diverse portfolios than we have   the petroleum industry is highly competitive and very capital intensive we encounter competition from numerous companies including acquiring rights to explore for crude oil and natural gas to a lesser extent we are also in competition with producers of alternative fuels or other forms of energy including wind solar and electric power and in the future could face increasing competition due to the development and adoption of new technologies many competitors including national oil companies are larger and have substantially greater resources to acquire and develop oil and gas assets in addition competition for drilling services technical expertise and equipment may affect the availability of technical personnel and drilling rigs resulting in increased capital and operating costs many of our competitors have a more diverse portfolio of assets which may minimize the impact of adverse events occurring at any one location 

significant time delays between the estimated and actual occurrence of critical events associated with development projects may result in material negative economic consequences as part of our business we are involved in large development projects the completion of which may be delayed beyond what was originally planned such examples include but are not limited to delays in receiving necessary approvals from project members or regulatory or other government agencies timely access to necessary equipment availability of necessary personnel construction delays unfavorable weather conditions equipment failures and outbreaks of infectious diseases these delays could impact our future results of operations and cash flows 

departures of key members from our senior management team andor difficulty in recruiting and retaining adequate numbers of experienced technical personnel could negatively impact our ability to deliver on our strategic goals our future success depends upon the continued service of key members of our senior management team who play an important role in developing and implementing our strategy the departure of key members of senior management or an inability to recruit and retain adequate numbers of experienced technical and professional personnel in the necessary locations may prevent us from executing our strategy in full or in part which could negatively impact our business 

we are dependent on oilfield service companies for items including drilling rigs equipment supplies and skilled labor an inability or significant delay in securing these services or a high cost thereof may result in material negative economic consequences the availability and cost of drilling rigs equipment supplies and skilled labor will fluctuate over time given the cyclical nature of the ep industry as a result we may encounter difficulties in obtaining required services or 

 

 

 

could face an increase in cost which may impact our ability to run our operations and deliver projects on time with the potential for material negative economic consequences 

we engage in risk management transactions designed to mitigate commodity price volatility and other risks but such activities may impede our ability to benefit from commodity price increases and can expose us to similar potential counterparty credit risk as amounts due from the sale of hydrocarbons we may enter into commodity price hedging arrangements to protect us from commodity price declines these arrangements may depending on the instruments used and the level of additional hedges involved limit any potential upside from commodity price increases as with accounts receivable from the sale of hydrocarbons we may be exposed to potential economic loss should a counterparty be unable or unwilling to perform their obligations under the terms of a hedging agreement in addition we are exposed to risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency values and may engage in hedging activities to mitigate related volatility 

one of our subsidiaries is the general partner of a publicly traded limited partnership hess midstream lp the responsibilities associated with being a general partner expose us to a broader range of legal liabilities  our control of hess midstream lp bestows upon us additional duties and obligations including but not limited to the obligations associated with managing potential conflicts of interests and additional reporting requirements from the securities and exchange commission these heightened duties expose us to additional potential for legal claims that may have a material negative economic impact on our shareholders moreover these increased duties may lead to an increase in compliance costs 

disruption failure or cyber security breaches affecting or targeting computer telecommunications systems and infrastructure used by the corporation or our business partners may materially impact our business and operations computers and telecommunication systems are an integral part of our exploration development and production activities and the activities of our business partners we use these systems to analyze and store financial and operating data and to communicate within our corporation and with outside business partners technical system flaws power loss cyber security risks including cyber or phishingattacks unauthorized access malicious software data privacy breaches by employees or others with authorized access ransomware and other cyber security issues could compromise our computer and telecommunications systems or those of our business partners and result in disruptions to our business operations or the access disclosure or loss of our data and proprietary information in addition computers control oil and gas production processing equipment and distribution systems globally and are necessary to deliver our production to market a disruption failure or a cyber breach of these operating systems or of the networks and infrastructure on which they rely could damage critical production distribution andor storage assets delay or prevent delivery to markets and make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transactions as a result any such disruption failure or cyber breach and any resulting investigation or remediation costs litigation or regulatory action could have a material adverse impact on our cash flows and results of operations reputation and competitiveness we routinely experience attempts by external parties to penetrate and attack our networks and systems although such attempts to date have not resulted in any material breaches disruptions financial loss or loss of businesscritical information our systems and procedures for protecting against such attacks and mitigating such risks may prove to be insufficient in the future and such attacks could have an adverse impact on our business and operations including damage to our reputation and competitiveness remediation costs litigation or regulatory actions in addition as technologies evolve and these cyber security attacks become more sophisticated we may incur significant costs to upgrade or enhance our security measures to protect against such attacks and we may face difficulties in fully anticipating or implementing adequate preventive measures or mitigating potential harm

 i tem 3 legal proceedings 

we are subject to loss contingencies with respect to various claims lawsuits and other proceedings a liability is recognized in our consolidated financial statements when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated if the risk of loss is probable but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated or the risk of loss is only reasonably possible a liability is not accrued however we disclose the nature of those contingencies we cannot predict with certainty if how or when existing claims lawsuits and proceedings will be resolved or what the eventual relief if any may be particularly for proceedings that are in their early stages of development or where plaintiffs seek indeterminate damages 

we along with many companies that have been or continue to be engaged in refining and marketing of gasoline have been a party to lawsuits and claims related to the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe in gasoline a series of similar lawsuits many involving water utilities or governmental entities were filed in jurisdictions across the us against producers of mtbe and petroleum refiners who produced gasoline containing mtbe including us the principal allegation in all cases was that gasoline containing mtbe was a defective product and that these producers and refiners are strictly liable in proportion to their share of the gasoline market for damage to groundwater resources and are required to take remedial action to ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of releases of mtbe the majority of the cases asserted against us have been settled there are three remaining active cases filed by pennsylvania rhode island and maryland in june 2014 the commonwealth of pennsylvania filed a lawsuit alleging that we and all major oil companies with operations in pennsylvania have damaged the groundwater by introducing thereto gasoline with mtbe the pennsylvania suit has been forwarded to the existing mtbe multidistrict litigation pending in the southern district of new york in september 2016 the state of rhode island also filed a lawsuit alleging that we and other major oil companies damaged the groundwater in rhode island by introducing thereto gasoline with mtbe the suit filed in rhode island is proceeding in federal court in december 2017 the state of maryland filed a lawsuit alleging that we and other major oil companies damaged the groundwater in maryland by introducing thereto gasoline with mtbe the suit filed in maryland state court was served on us in january 2018 and has been removed to federal court by the defendants

in september 2003 we received a directive from the new jersey department of environmental protection njdep to remediate contamination in the sediments of the lower passaic river the njdep is also seeking natural resource damages the directive insofar as it affects us relates to alleged releases from a petroleum bulk storage terminal in newark new jersey we previously owned we and over 70 companies entered into an administrative order on consent with the environmental protection agency epa to study the same contamination this work remains ongoing we and other parties settled a cost recovery claim by the state of new jersey and agreed with the epa to fund remediation of a portion of the site on march 4 2016 the epa issued a record of decision rod in respect of the lower eight miles of the lower passaic river selecting a remedy that includes banktobank dredging at an estimated cost of 138 billion the rod does not address the upper nine miles of the lower passaic river or the newark bay which may require additional remedial action in addition the federal trustees for natural resources have begun a separate assessment of damages to natural resources in the passaic river given that the epa has not selected a remedy for the entirety of the lower passaic river or the newark bay total remedial costs cannot be reliably estimated at this time based on currently known facts and circumstances we do not believe that this matter will result in a significant liability to us because our former terminal did not store or use contaminants which are of concern in the river sediments and could not have contributed contamination along the river’s length further there are numerous other parties who we expect will bear the cost of remediation and damages

in march 2014 we received an administrative order from the epa requiring us and 26 other parties to undertake the remedial design for the remedy selected by the epa for the gowanus canal superfund site in brooklyn new york our alleged liability derives from our former ownership and operation of a fuel oil terminal and connected shipbuilding and repair facility adjacent to the canal the remedy selected by the epa includes dredging of surface sediments and the placement of a cap over the deeper sediments throughout the canal and insitu stabilization of certain contaminated sediments that will remain in place below the cap the epa’s original estimate was that this remedy would cost 506 million  however the ultimate costs that will be incurred in connection with the design and implementation of the remedy remain uncertain we have complied with the epa’s march 2014 administrative order and contributed funding for the remedial design based on an allocation of costs among the parties determined by a thirdparty expert in january 2020 we received an additional administrative order from the epa requiring us and several other parties to begin remedial action along the uppermost portion of the canal we intend to comply with this administrative order the remediation work is anticipated to begin in the fourth quarter of 2020 the costs will continue to be allocated amongst the parties as they were for the remedial design 

we periodically receive notices from the epa that we are a “potential responsible party” under the superfund legislation with respect to various waste disposal sites under this legislation all potentially responsible parties may be jointly and severally liable for any site for which we have received such a notice the epa’s claims or assertions of liability against us relating to these sites have not been fully developed or the epa’s claims have been settled or a settlement is under consideration in all cases for amounts that are not material the ultimate impact of these proceedings and of any related proceedings by 

 

 

 

private parties on our business or accounts cannot be predicted at this time due to the large number of other potentially responsible parties and the speculative nature of cleanup cost estimates but is not expected to be material 

from time to time we are involved in other judicial and administrative proceedings including proceedings relating to other environmental matters we cannot predict with certainty if how or when such proceedings will be resolved or what the eventual relief if any may be particularly for proceedings that are in their early stages of development or where plaintiffs seek indeterminate damages numerous issues may need to be resolved including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters before a loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated for any proceeding

subject to the foregoing in management’s opinion based upon currently known facts and circumstances the outcome of lawsuits claims and proceedings including the matters disclosed above is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows however we could incur judgments enter into settlements or revise our opinion regarding the outcome of certain matters and such developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the amounts are accrued and our cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid

significant 2019 activities 

the following is an update of significant ep activities during 2019

ep assets



during 2020 we plan to operate six rigs drill approximately 170 wells and bring approximately 175 wells on production w e forecast net production to average approximately 180000 boepd in 2020 and to reach approximately 200000 boepd by the end of 2020 in the third quarter of 2020 the tioga gas plant will be shut down for approximately 45 days for a planned turnaround and tiein of the plant expansion project which will increase gas processing capacity to 400 million cubic feet per day from 250 million cubic feet per day and is expected to be in service by mid2021 the shutdown for the turnaround is expected to reduce 2020 average net production mostly natural gas liquids and natural gas by approximately 6000 boepd commencing in 2021 we plan to reduce our rig count to four operated rigs and at this level of activity expect to hold net production relatively flat at approximately 200000 boepd for at least five years



in 2019 the corporation announced a discovery at the hess operated esox1 exploration well in mississippi canyon block no 726 hess 57 which encountered approximately 191 feet of net pay in highquality oilbearing miocene reservoirs first production from the well was achieved in february 2020 as a tieback to the tubular bells production facilities 

during the fourth quarter of 2019 the operator kosmos energy ltd commenced drilling of the oldfield1 exploration well hess 60 located approximately 6 miles east of esox1 the well which was completed in january 2020 did not encounter commercial quantities of hydrocarbons and 2019 results include 15 million in exploration expense for well costs incurred through december 31 2019 we estimate approximately 15 million of exploration expense will be recognized in the first quarter of 2020 for well costs incurred after december 31 2019



the liza phase 1 development which was sanctioned in 2017 began producing oil in december 2019 from the liza destiny fpso production is expected to ramp up to the full capacity of 120000 gross bopd in 2020 we forecast net production for 2020 to average approximately 25000 bopd

the liza phase 2 development was sanctioned in 2019 and will utilize the liza unity fpso to produce up to 220000 gross bopd with first production expected by early 2022 six drill centers are planned with a total of 30 wells including 15 production wells nine water injection wells and six gas injection wells in 2020 the operator plans to commence development drilling installation of subsea flow lines and equipment and installation of topside facilities modules on the liza unity fpso 

a third development at the payara field is expected to be sanctioned following government and regulatory approvals and is expected to produce up to 220000 gross bopd with startup as early as 2023 in addition to the first three developments planning is underway for additional fpsos the ultimate sizing and timing of these potential developments will be a function of further exploration and appraisal drilling

in 2019 five successful exploration wells and three successful appraisal wells were drilled on the stabroek block see detailed well results on page 9 of items 1 and 2 business and properties 



 

 



the following is an update of significant midstream activities during 2019









liquidity and capital and exploratory expenditures

in 2019 net cash provided by operating activities was 1642 million 2018 1939 million at december 31 2019 consolidated cash and cash equivalents were 1545 million 2018 2694 million consolidated debt was 7142 million 2018 6672 million including capital lease obligations and our consolidated debt to capitalization ratio was 432 2018 380 hess midstream debt which is nonrecourse to hess corporation was 1753 million at december 31 2019 2018 981 million

capital and exploratory expenditures were as follows in millions

 



 



 





in 2020 we project our ep capital and exploratory expenditures will be approximately 30 billion and midstream capital expenditures to be approximately 350 million

 

 

consoli dated results of operations 

results by segment

the aftertax income loss by major operating activity is summarized below

 





in the following discussion and elsewhere in this report the financial effects of certain transactions are disclosed on an aftertax basis management reviews segment earnings on an aftertax basis and uses aftertax amounts in its review of variances in segment earnings management believes that aftertax amounts are a preferable method of explaining variances in earnings since they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only the pretax amount aftertax amounts are determined by applying the income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pretax amounts

items affecting comparability of earnings between periods

the following table summarizes items of income expense that are included in net income loss and affect comparability of earnings between periods the items in the table below are explained on pages 36 through 39

the following table reconciles reported net cash provided by used in operating activities and net cash provided by used in operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities 



adjusted net income loss attributable to hess corporation is a nongaap financial measure which we define as reported net income loss attributable to hess corporation excluding items identified as affecting comparability of earnings between periods which are summarized on pages 36 through 39  management uses adjusted net income loss to evaluate the corporation’s operating performance and believes that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this measure which excludes certain items that management believes are not directly related to ongoing operations and are not indicative of future business trends and operations 

net cash provided by used in operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities presented in this report is a nongaap measure which we define as reported net cash provided by used in operating activities excluding changes in operating assets and liabilities management uses net cash provided by used in operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities to evaluate the corporation’s ability to internally fund capital expenditures pay dividends and service debt and believes that investors’ understanding of our ability to generate cash to fund these items is enhanced by disclosing this measure which excludes working capital and other movements that may distort assessment of our performance between periods

selling prices average worldwide realized crude oil selling prices including hedging were 7  lower in 2019 compared with the prior year primarily due to the decrease in brent and wti crude oil prices in addition realized worldwide selling prices for ngl decreased in 2019 by 39  and worldwide natural gas prices decreased in 2019 by 7 compared with the prior year in total lower realized selling prices decreased 2019 financial results by approximately 380 million after income taxes compared with 2018 our average selling prices were as follows 





crude oil hedging activities were a net gain of 1 million before and after income taxes in 2019 and a loss of 183 million before and after income taxes in 2018 for calendar year 2020 we have wti put options with an average monthly floor price of 55 per barrel for 130000 bopd and brent put options with an average monthly floor price of 60 per barrel for 20000 bopd we expect noncash put option premium amortization which will be reflected in realized selling prices to reduce our 2020 results by approximately 70 million per quarter 

 

 

production volumes our daily worldwide net production was as follows 









in 2020 we expect net production excluding libya to average between 330000 boepd and 335000 boepd compared with 2019 net production excluding libya of 290000 boepd 

net production variances related to 2019 and 2018 are summarized as follows

united states   bakken net oil production was higher in 2019 primarily due to increased drilling activity and new plug and perf completion design  bakken net natural gas and ngl production was higher in 2019 also due to the increased drilling activity additional natural gas captured with the startup of the little missouri 4 natural gas processing plant in the third quarter of 2019 and additional ngl received under percentage of proceeds contracts resulting from lower ngl commodity pricing the decline in us other onshore net production from 2018 reflects the sale of our interests in the utica shale play in august 2018 us offshore net production increased in 2019 primarily due to higher production from the conger and penn state fields and a new well brought online at the llano field  

international in europe africa and asia net production was comparable in 2019 with 2018 

 

 

sales volumes the impact of higher sales volumes from our net production improved aftertax results by approximately 560 million in 2019 compared with 2018 

net worldwide sales volumes from hess net production which excludes sales volumes of crude oil ngl and natural gas purchased from third parties were as follows



marketing including purchased oil and gas marketing expense   marketing expense is mainly comprised of costs to purchase crude oil ngl and natural gas from our partners in hess operated wells or other third parties primarily in the us and transportation and other distribution costs for us marketing activities marketing expense for 2019 is comparable to 2018 primarily due to lower benchmark crude oil prices on the cost of purchased volumes being largely offset by higher purchases of thirdparty volumes 

cash operating costs   cash operating costs consisting of operating costs and expenses production and severance taxes and ep general and administrative expenses decreased 11 million in 2019 compared to 2018 cash operating costs in 2018 included pretax charges totaling 91 million for vacated office space and severance costs which more than offset increased costs from higher production in 2019 on a perunit basis cash operating costs improved from 2018 reflecting higher net production volumes in 2019 see exit costs and other in items affecting comparability of earnings between periods on page 37 

midstream tariffs expense tariffs expense increased from 2018 primarily due to higher throughput volumes in 2019 in 2020 we estimate midstream tariffs expense to be in the range of 940 million to 965 million 

depreciation depletion and amortization dda dda costs increased by 229 million from 2018 primarily due to higher net production volumes in the bakken and gulf of mexico   

unit costs unit cost per boe information is based on total ep production volumes and excludes items affecting comparability of earnings as disclosed below actual and forecast unit costs are as follows 









exploration expenses   exploration expenses including items affecting comparability of earnings described below were as follows 



in 2019 dry hole costs primarily related to the jill1 well on license 616 in denmark and the oldfield1 well in the gulf of mexico in 2018 dry hole costs primarily related to the aspy well offshore nova scotia canada the pontoenoe1 well offshore suriname and the sorubim1 well on the stabroek block offshore guyana in 2020 we estimate exploration expenses excluding dry hole expense to be in the range of 210 million to 220 million 

 

 

income taxes in 2019 income tax expense was 375 million 2018 391 million primarily related to our operations in libya commencing in 2017 we are generally not recognizing deferred tax benefit or expense in certain countries primarily the us denmark hydrocarbon tax only malaysia and guyana until december 2019 while we maintain valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets in these jurisdictions in accordance with the requirements of us accounting standards at december 31 2019 the valuation allowance established against the net deferred tax asset in guyana for the stabroek block was released as a result of the positive evidence from first production in december 2019 and the significant forecasted pretax income from operations the cumulative pretax losses in guyana were driven by preproduction activities see ep items affecting comparability of earnings below 

actual effective tax rates are as follows





in 2020 we estimate income tax expense excluding libya and items affecting comparability of earnings between periods to be in the range of 80 million to 90 million

items affecting comparability of earnings between periods reported ep earnings include the following items affecting comparability of income expense before and after income taxes 



the pretax amounts of ep items affecting comparability of income expense as presented in the statement of consolidated income are as follow s

midstream 

following is a summarized statement of income for our midstream operations





sales and other operating revenues increased from 2018 primarily due to higher throughput volumes increased rail transportation and water trucking revenues associated with thirdparty services and higher tariff rates

operating costs and expenses increased from 2018 p rimarily due to higher maintenance activity and increased third party rail transportation and water trucking charges  general and administrative expenses increased in 2019 compared to 2018 as a result of expenditures incurred from hess midstream partners lp’s acquisition of hip and its corporate restructuring see items affecting comparability of earnings between periods below dda expenses increased from 2018 primarily due to additional assets places in service including those related to the summit acquisition 

the increase in interest expense from 2018 reflects higher borrowings by the midstream business

in 2020 we estimate net income attributable to hess corporation from the midstream segment to be in the range of 205 million to 215 million 

items affecting comparability of earnings between periods in 2019 we recognized a pretax charge of 30 million 16 million after income taxes and noncontrolling interests for transaction related costs for hess midstream partners lp’s acquisition of hip and associated corporate restructuring see note 6 hess midstream in the notes to consolidated financial statements  in 2017 we recognized a pretax loss of 57 million 34 million after income taxes and noncontrolling interests related to the sale of our midstream assets in the permian basin 

 

 

corporate interest and other 

the following table summarizes corporate interest and other expenses



corporate and other expenses excluding items affecting comparability increased from 2018 primarily due to lower interest income and a reduction in other nonoperating income  in 2020 aftertax corporate and other expenses excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods are estimated to be in the range of 115 million to 125 million 

interest expense for 2019 is comparable to 2018 capitalized interest increased from 2018 due to ongoing development activity in guyana including the sanction of the liza field phase 2 development during 2019 in 2020 aftertax interest expense net is estimated to be in the range of 350 million to 360 million the estimated increase in 2020 is due to ceasing interest capitalization at the liza field which commenced production in december 2019 

items affecting comparability of earnings between periods corporate interest and other results included the following items affecting comparability of income expense before and after income taxes

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table sets forth certain relevant measures of our liquidity and capital resources at december 31









cash flows

the following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows



operating activities  net cash provided by operating activities was 1642 million in 2019 2018 1939 million while net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities was 2237 million in 2019 2018 2129 million net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities increased from 2018 primarily due to higher net production volumes partially offset by lower commodity prices changes in operating assets and liabilities in 2019 reduced net cash provided by operating activities by 595 million 2018 190 million reduction primarily from premiums paid on crude oil hedge contracts abandonment expenditures pension contributions a nd an increase in accounts receivable changes in operating assets and liabilities in 2018 primarily related to premiums on crude oil hedge contracts and abandonment expenditures 

investing activities total additions to property plant and equipment were 2829 million in 2019 2018 2097 million the increase in additions to property plant and equipment from 2018 is primarily related to increased drilling activity in the bakken increased exploration and development activity on the stabroek block offshore guyana and the midstream operating segment’s acquisition of assets from summit midstream partners lp in 2019 midstream equity investments in its 5050 joint venture with targa resources were 33 million 2018 67 million p roceeds from asset sales were 22 million in 2019 2018 607 million 2017 3296 million see note 3 dispositions in the notes to consolidated financial statements  

financing activities r epayments of debt were 8 million in 2019 2018 633 million while borrowings with maturities in excess of 90 days of 760 million in 2019 related to our midstream operating segment  common and preferred stock dividends paid were 316 million in 2019 2018 345 million we settled 25 million of common stock purchases in 2019 2018 1365 million net cash outflows to noncontrolling interests were 353 million in 2019 2018 211 million 

future capital requirements and resources

at december 31 2019 hess corporation had 15 billion in cash and cash equivalents excluding midstream and total liquidity including available committed credit facilities of approximately 54 billion the corporation has no significant nearterm debt maturities   currently we have wti put options for calendar year 2020 with an average monthly floor price of 55 per barrel for 130000 bopd and brent put options for calendar year 2020 with an average monthly floor price of 60 per barrel for 20000 bopd 

net production in 2020 is forecast to be in the range of 330000 boepd to 335000 boepd excluding libya and we expect our 2020 ep capital and exploratory expenditures will be approximately 30 billion in 2020 based on current forward strip crude oil prices we expect cash flow from operating activities cash and cash equivalents existing at december 31 2019 and our available committed revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our capital investment program and dividends 

 

 

the table below summarizes the capacity usage and available capacity of our borrowing and letter of credit facilities at december 31 2019 







hess corporation 

in 2019 the corporation entered into a new 35 billion revolving credit facility with a maturity date of may 15 2023 which replaced the corporation’s previous revolving credit facility that was scheduled to mature on january 21 2021 the new facility which is fully undrawn can be used for borrowings and letters of credit borrowings on the new facility will generally bear interest at 130 above libor though the interest rate is subject to adjustment if the corporation’s credit rating changes the facility is subject to customary representations warranties and covenants including a financial covenant limiting the ratio of total consolidated debt to total capitalization as such terms are defined in the credit agreement for the facility of the corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries to 65 and customary events of default at december 31 2019 the corporation was in compliance with its financial covenants

we had 272 million in letters of credit outstanding at december 31 2019 2018 284 million which primarily relate to our international operations see also note 19 financial risk management activities in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

we have a shelf registration under which we may issue additional debt securities warrants common stock or preferred stock

midstream 

at december 31 2019 hess midstream operations lp formerly hess midstream partners lp or hesm opco a consolidated subsidiary of hess midstream lp had 14 billion of senior secured syndicated credit facilities maturing december 16 2024 consisting of a 10 billion 5year revolving credit facility and a fully drawn 400 million 5year term loan a facility the revolving credit facility can be used for borrowings and letters of credit to fund hesm opco’s operating activities capital expenditures distributions and for other general corporate purposes borrowings under the 5year term loan a facility will generally bear interest at libor plus an applicable margin ranging from 155 to 250 while the applicable margin for the 5year syndicated revolving credit facility ranges from 1275 to 2000 pricing levels for the facility fee and interestrate margins are based on hesm opco’s ratio of total debt to ebitda as defined in the credit facilities if hesm opco obtains an investment grade credit rating the pricing levels will be based on hesm opco’s credit ratings in effect from time to time the credit facilities contain covenants that require hesm opco to maintain a ratio of total debt to ebitda as defined in the credit facilities for the prior four fiscal quarters of not greater than 500 to 100 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter 550 to 100 during the specified period following certain acquisitions and prior to hesm opco obtaining an investment grade credit rating a ratio of secured debt to ebitda for the prior four fiscal quarters of not greater than 400 to 100 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter hesm opco was in compliance with these financial covenants at december 31 2019 the credit facilities are secured by firstpriority perfected liens on substantially all the presently owned and afteracquired assets of hesm opco and its direct and indirect wholly owned material domestic subsidiaries including equity interests directly owned by such entities subject to certain customary exclusions at december 31 2019 borrowings of 32 million were drawn under hesm opco’s revolving credit facility and borrowings of 400 million excluding deferred issuance costs were drawn under hesm opco’s term loan a facility borrowings under these credit facilities are nonrecourse to hess corporation 

 

 

credit ratings 

two of the three major credit rating agencies that rate the corporation’s debt have assigned an investment grade rating at december 31 2019 we have investment grade credit ratings from standard and poor’s ratings services bbb and fitch ratings bbb moody’s investors service has rated our debt at ba1 the consequence of lower credit ratings is an increase in interest rates and facility fees on our credit facilities and the potential for additional required collateral under operating agreements which are not material at december 31 2019

at december 31 2019 hesm opco’s senior unsecured debt is rated bb by standard and poor’s ratings services and fitch ratings and ba3 by moody’s investors service

contractual obligations and contingencies

the following table shows aggregate information about certain contractual obligations at december 31 2019







capital expenditures represent amounts that we were contractually committed at december 31 2019 including the portion of our planned capital expenditure program for 2020 obligations for operating expenses include commitments for oil and gas production expenses seismic purchases and other normal business expenses other liabilities reflect contractually committed obligations in the consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2019 including pension plan liabilities and estimates for uncertain income tax positions the corporation and certain of its subsidiaries primarily lease drilling rigs equipment logistical assets offshore vessels aircraft and shorebases and office space for varying periods see note 7 leases in notes to consolidated financial statements 

offbalance sheet arrangements

at december 31 2019 we had 272 million in letters of credit see also note 17 guarantees contingencies and commitments in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

foreign operations

we conduct ep activities outside the us principally in guyana the joint development area of malaysiathailand and malaysia denmark libya suriname and canada therefore we are subject to the risks associated with foreign operations including political risk tax law changes currency risk corruption and acts of terrorism see item 1a risk factors for further details

 

 

critical ac counting policies and estimates 

accounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and revenues and expenses in the statement of consolidated income  the accounting methods used can affect net income equity and various financial statement ratios however our accounting policies generally do not change cash flows or liquidity

accounting for exploration and development costs ep activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage including lease bonuses brokers’ fees and other related costs are capitalized annual lease rentals exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred costs of drilling and equipping productive wells including development dry holes and related production facilities are capitalized 

the costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if 1 the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and 2 sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operational viability of the project if either of those criteria is not met or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project the capitalized well costs are charged to expense indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves and the economic and operating viability of a project include commitment of project personnel active negotiations for sales contracts with customers negotiations with governments operators and contractors and firm plans for additional drilling and other factors

crude oil and natural gas reserves the determination of estimated proved reserves is a significant element in arriving at the results of operations of ep activities the estimates of proved reserves affect well capitalizations the unit of production depreciation rates of proved properties and wells and equipment as well as impairment testing of oil and gas assets 

for reserves to be booked as proved they must be determined with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations in addition government and project operator approvals must be obtained and depending on the amount of the project cost senior management or the board of directors must commit to fund the project we maintain our own internal reserve estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work directly with the oil and gas properties our technical staff update reserve estimates throughout the year based on evaluations of new wells performance reviews new technical data and other studies to provide consistency throughout the corporation standard reserve estimation guidelines definitions reporting reviews and approval practices are used the internal reserve estimates are subject to internal technical audits and senior management review we also engage an independent thirdparty consulting firm to audit approximately 80 of our total proved reserves each year

proved reserves are calculated using the average price during the twelvemonth period ending december 31 determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the price on the first day of each month within the year unless prices are defined by contractual agreements excluding escalations based on future conditions as discussed in item 1a risk factors  crude oil prices are volatile which can have an impact on our proved reserves if crude oil prices in 2020 are at levels below that used in determining 2019 proved reserves we may recognize negative revisions to our december 31 2020 proved undeveloped reserves in addition we may recognize negative revisions to proved developed reserves which can vary significantly by asset due to differing operating cost structures conversely price increases in 2020 above those used in determining 2019 proved reserves could result in positive revisions to proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves at december 31 2020 it is difficult to estimate the magnitude of any potential net negative or positive change in proved reserves at december 31 2020 due to numerous currently unknown factors including 2020 crude oil prices any revisions based on 2020 reservoir performance and the levels to which industry costs will change in response to movements in commodity prices a 10 change in proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves at december 31 2019 would result in an approximate 200 million pretax change in depreciation depletion and amortization expense for 2020 based on projected production volumes see the supplementary oil and gas data on pages 90 through 98 in the accompanying financial statements for additional information on our oil and gas reserves

impairment of longlived assets we review long‑lived assets including oil and gas fields for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered long‑lived assets are tested based on identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities if the carrying amounts of the longlived assets are not expected to be recovered by estimated undiscounted future net cash flows the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded the amount of impairment is determined based on the estimated fair value of the assets generally determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows an income valuation approach or by a market‑based valuation approach which are level 3 fair value measurements 

in the case of oil and gas fields the present value of future net cash flows is based on management’s best estimate of future prices which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices applied to projected production volumes and discounted at a riskadjusted rate the projected production volumes represent reserves including probable reserves expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures the production volumes 

 

 

prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairment will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows since the standardized measure requires the use of historical twelvemonth average prices 

our impairment tests of longlived ep producing assets are based on our best estimates of future production volumes including recovery factors selling prices operating and capital costs the timing of future production and other factors which are updated each time an impairment test is performed while crude oil prices in 2019 were lower than last year we could experience an asset impairment in the future if the projected production volumes from oil and gas fields decrease crude oil and natural gas selling prices decline significantly for an extended period or future estimated capital and operating costs increase significantly

midstream joint venture we consolidate the activities of our interest in hess midstream lp  which qualifies as a variable interest entity vie under us generally accepted accounting principles we have concluded that we are the primary beneficiary of the vie as defined in the accounting standards since we have the power through hess corporation’s 47 consolidated ownership interest in hess midstream lp to direct those activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of hess midstream lp  and are obligated to absorb losses or have the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to hess midstream lp  this conclusion was based on a qualitative analysis that considered hess midstream lp ’s governance structure the commercial agreements between hess midstream lp and us and the voting rights established between the members which provide us the ability to control the operations of hess midstream lp  

income taxes judgments are required in the determination and recognition of income tax assets and liabilities in the financial statements these judgments include the requirement to recognize the financial statement effect of a tax position only when management believes it is more likely than not based on the technical merits that the position will be sustained upon examination 

we have net operating loss carryforwards or credit carryforwards in multiple jurisdictions and have recorded deferred tax assets for those losses and credits additionally we have deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized if when tested under the relevant accounting standards it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized 

the accounting standards require the evaluation of all available positive and negative evidence giving weight based on the evidence’s relative objectivity in evaluating potential sources of positive evidence we consider the reversal of taxable temporary differences taxable income in carryback and carryforward periods the availability of tax planning strategies the existence of appreciated assets estimates of future taxable income and other factors estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas reserves selling prices and other subjective operating assumptions that are consistent with internal business forecasts in evaluating potential sources of negative evidence we consider a cumulative loss in recent years any history of operating losses or tax credit carryforwards expiring unused losses expected in early future years unsettled circumstances that if unfavorably resolved would adversely affect future operations and profit levels on a continuing basis in future years and any carryback or carryforward period so brief that a significant deductible temporary difference expected to reverse in a single year would limit realization of tax benefits due to a sustained low commodity price environment we remained in a threeyear cumulative consolidated loss position at december 31 2019 a threeyear cumulative consolidated loss constitutes objective negative evidence to which the accounting standards require we assign significant weight relative to subjective evidence such as our estimates of future taxable income we are generally not recognizing deferred tax benefit or expense in certain countries primarily the us denmark hydrocarbon tax only and malaysia while we maintain valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets in these jurisdictions in december 2019 we reversed the valuation allowance of 60 million for guyana upon achieving first production from the liza phase 1 development

at december 31 2019 the consolidated balance sheet reflects a 4734 million valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets for multiple jurisdictions based on the evaluation of the accounting standards described above the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable however could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income change or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight is given to subjective evidence such as expected future growth 

asset retirement obligations we have material legal obligations to remove and dismantle long‑lived assets and to restore land or seabed at certain ep locations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we recognize a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations in addition the fair value of any legally required conditional asset retirement obligation is recorded if the liability can be reasonably estimated we capitalize such costs as a component of the carrying amount of the underlying assets in the period in which the liability is incurred in subsequent periods the liability is accreted and the asset is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset we estimate the fair value of these obligations by discounting projected future payments that will be required to satisfy the obligations in determining these estimates we are 

 

 

required to make several assumptions and judgments related to the scope of dismantlement timing of settlement interpretation of legal requirements inflationary factors and discount rate in addition there are other external factors which could significantly affect the ultimate settlement costs or timing for these obligations including changes in environmental regulations and other statutory requirements fluctuations in industry costs and foreign currency exchange rates and advances in technology as a result our estimates of asset retirement obligations are subject to revision due to the factors described above changes in estimates prior to settlement result in adjustments to both the liability and related asset values unless the field has ceased production in which case changes are recognized in our consolidated statement of income  see note 9 asset retirement obligations  

retirement plans we have funded noncontributory defined benefit pension plans an unfunded supplemental pension plan and an unfunded postretirement medical plan we recognize the net change in the funded status of the projected benefit obligation for these plans in the consolidated balance sheet  the determination of the obligations and expenses related to these plans are based on several actuarial assumptions these assumptions represent estimates made by us some of which can be affected by external factors the most significant assumptions relate to 

discount rate used for measuring the present value of future plan obligations the discount rate used to estimate our projected benefit obligations is based on a portfolio of high‑quality fixed income debt instruments with maturities that approximate the expected payment of plan obligations at december 31 2019 a 025 decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase projected benefit obligations by approximately 120 million and forecasted 2020 annual benefit expense by approximately 10 million the increase in the projected benefit obligations would decrease the funded status of our pension plans but any decrease in the funded status would be partially mitigated by increases in the fair value of fixed income investments in the asset portfolios 

expected longterm rates of returns on plan assets the expected return on plan assets is developed from the expected future returns for each asset category weighted by the target allocation of pension assets to that asset category t he future expected return assumptions for individual asset categories are largely based on inputs from various investment experts regarding their future return expectations for particular asset categories at december 31 2019 a 025 decrease in the expected longterm rates of return on plan assets assumption would increase forecasted 2020 annual benefit expense by approximately 5 million 

other assumptions include the rate of future increases in compensation levels and participant mortality level

derivatives we utilize derivative instruments including futures forwards options and swaps individually or in combination to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in the prices of crude oil and natural gas as well as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates all derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet  our policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative the changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized currently in earnings derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions cash flow hedges or hedges of changes in fair value of recognized assets and liabilities or of unrecognized firm commitments fair value hedges changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income loss amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings the change in fair value of the related hedged commitment is recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized currently in earnings 

fair value measurements we use various valuation approaches in determining fair value for financial instruments including the market and income approaches our fair value measurements also include nonperformance risk and time value of money considerations counterparty credit is considered for receivable balances and our credit is considered for accrued liabilities 

we also record certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value when required by generally accepted accounting principles these fair value measurements are recorded in connection with business combinations qualifying nonmonetary exchanges the initial recognition of asset retirement obligations and any impairment of longlived assets equity method investments or goodwill

we determine fair value in accordance with the fair value measurements accounting standard which established a hierarchy for the inputs used to measure fair value based on the source of the inputs which generally range from quoted prices for identical instruments in a principal trading market level 1 to estimates determined using related market data level 3 including discounted cash flows and other unobservable data  measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered level 2 when level 1 inputs are available within a particular market those inputs are selected for determination of fair value over level 2 or 3 inputs in the same market multiple inputs 

 

 

may be used to measure fair value however the level of fair value assigned for each physical derivative and financial asset or liability is based on the lowest significant input level within this fair value hierarchy 

environment health and safety

our longterm vision and values provide a foundation for how we do business and define our commitment to meeting high standards of corporate citizenship and creating a long lasting positive impact on the communities where we do business our strategy is reflected in our environment health safety and social responsibility ehs  sr policies and by a management system framework that helps protect our workforce customers and local communities our management systems are intended to promote internal consistency adherence to policy objectives and continual improvement in ehs  sr performance improved performance may in the short‑term increase our operating costs and could also require increased capital expenditures to reduce potential risks to our assets reputation and license to operate in addition to enhanced ehs  sr performance improved productivity and operational efficiencies may be realized from investments in ehs  sr we have programs in place to evaluate regulatory compliance audit facilities train employees prevent and manage risks and emergencies and to generally meet corporate ehs  sr goals and objectives

we recognize that climate change is a global environmental concern we assess monitor and take measures to reduce our carbon footprint at existing and planned operations we are committed to complying with all greenhouse gas ghg emissions regulations and the responsible management of ghg emissions at our facilities

we will have continuing expenditures for environmental assessment and remediation sites where corrective action may be necessary include ep facilities sites from discontinued operations where we retained liability and although not currently significant “superfund” sites where we have been named a potentially responsible party

we accrue for environmental assessment and remediation expenses when the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable at december 31 2019 our reserve for estimated remediation liabilities was approximately 70 million we expect that existing reserves for environmental liabilities will adequately cover costs to assess and remediate known sites our remediation spending was approximately 20 million in 2019 2018 15 million 2017 15 million the amount of other expenditures incurred to comply with federal state local and foreign country environmental regulations is difficult to quantify as such costs are captured as mostly indistinguishable components of our capital expenditures and operating expenses

 

 

 




 ite m 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of our business we are exposed to commodity risks related to changes in the prices of crude oil ngl and natural gas as well as changes in interest rates and foreign currency values in the disclosures that follow financial risk management activities refer to the mitigation of these risks through hedging activities

controls we maintain a control environment under the direction of our chief risk officer controls over instruments used in financial risk management activities include volumetric and term limits our treasury department is responsible for administering and monitoring foreign exchange rate and interest rate hedging programs using similar controls and processes where applicable hedging strategies are reviewed annually by the audit committee of the board of directors 

instruments we primarily use forward commodity contracts foreign exchange forward contracts futures swaps and options in our risk management activities these contracts are generally widely traded instruments with standardized terms the following describes these instruments and how we use them 









financial risk management activities

at december 31 2019 outstanding total debt which was substantially comprised of fixed rate debt instruments had a carrying value of 7142 million and a fair value of 8242 million a 15 increase or decrease in interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately 450 million or 490 million respectively any changes in interest rates do not impact our cash outflows associated with fixed rate interest payments or settlement of debt principal unless a debt instrument is repurchased prior to maturity 

we have wti put options for calendar year 2020 with an average monthly floor price of 55 per barrel for 130000 bopd and brent put options for calendar year 2020 with an average monthly floor price of 60 per barrel for 20000 bopd as of december 31 2019 an assumed 10 increase in the forward wti and brent crude oil prices used in determining the fair value of our put options would reduce the fair value of these derivatives instruments by approximately 60 million while an assumed 10 decrease in the same crude oil prices would increase the fair value of these derivative instruments by approximately 110 million 

we have outstanding foreign exchange contracts with a total notional amount of 90 million at december 31 2019 that are used to reduce our exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates for various currencies the change in fair value of foreign exchange contracts from a 10 weakening of the us dollar exchange rate is estimated to be a loss of approximately 5 million at december 31 2019

other nonproducing countries 

guyana at the stabroek block hess 30 which covers approximately 66 million acres offshore guyana the operator esso exploration and production guyana limited has made twelve significant discoveries to date the first phase of the liza field development which was sanctioned in 2017 is expected to begin producing oil by early 2020 phase 1 will use the liza destiny fpso to produce up to 120000 gross bopd drilling of development wells in the liza field is continuing subsea equipment is being prepared for installation and the topside facilities modules have been installed on the liza destiny fpso in singapore which is expected to arrive offshore guyana in the third quarter of 2019 preparations are also underway for the installation of subsea umbilicals risers and flowlines at the liza field in the spring of 2019 

phase 2 of the liza field development is expected to start production by mid2022 pending government and regulatory approvals project sanction for phase 2 is expected by the operator in the first quarter of 2019 and will include a second fpso vessel designed to produce up to 220000 gross bopd project sanction for a third phase of development at the payara field is expected in 2019 with first production expected to start up as early as 2023 in addition to the first three phases development planning is underway for additional fpsos the ultimate sizing and timing will be a function of further exploration and appraisal drilling 

the operator is currently utilizing three drillships on the block the stena carron and the noble tom madden which arrived in the third quarter of 2018 are involved in exploration and appraisal drilling the noble bob douglas is drilling development wells for liza phase 1 in 2018 the following explorations wells were drilled on the stabroek block in chronological order

ranger1 the well located approximately 60 miles northwest of the liza discovery encountered approximately 230 feet of highquality oilbearing carbonate reservoir 

pacora1  the well encountered approximately 65 feet of highquality oilbearing sandstone reservoir and is located approximately four miles west of the payara1 well which was drilled in 2017 the operator plans to integrate this discovery into the payara field development 

liza5 the well encountered 77 feet of highquality oilbearing sandstone reservoir and is located approximately six miles northwest of the liza1 well which was drilled in 2016 

sorubim1 the well did not encounter commercial quantities of hydrocarbons 

longtail1  the well encountered approximately 256 feet of highquality oilbearing sandstone reservoir and is located approximately five miles west of the turbot1 well which was drilled in 2017 

hammerhead1 the well encountered approximately 197 feet of highquality oilbearing sandstone reservoir and is located approximately 13 miles to the southwest of the liza1 well 

pluma1 the well encountered approximately 121 feet of highquality hydrocarbonbearing sandstone reservoir and represents the tenth discovery on the block the well is located approximately 17 miles south of the turbot1 well 

in february 2019 the operator announced the eleventh and twelfth discoveries on the stabroek block at the tilapia1 and haimara1 wells the tilapia1 well encountered approximately 305 feet of highquality oilbearing sandstone reservoir and is located approximately three miles west of the longtail1 well the haimara1 well encountered approximately 207 feet of highquality gas condensatebearing sandstone reservoir and is located approximately 19 miles east of the pluma1 well

in 2019 additional drilling is planned including appraisal of the hammerhead ranger and turbot discoveries as well as a wider exploration program that will target additional prospects and play types on the block

in 2018 we acquired a participating interest in the kaieteur block hess 15 which is adjacent to the stabroek block the operator esso exploration and production guyana limited  expects to complete a 2d seismic shoot in 2019

suriname  we hold a 33 nonoperated participating interest in block 42 offshore suriname in 2018 the operator kosmos energy ltd completed drilling operations on the pontoenoe1 exploration well commercial quantities of hydrocarbons were not discovered and well results will be integrated into the ongoing evaluation for future exploration on the block we also hold a 33 nonoperated participating interest in block 59 offshore suriname where the operator exxonmobil exploration and production suriname bv commenced a seismic program in 2018 

canada we hold a 50 participating interest in four exploration licenses offshore nova scotia in 2018 the operator bp canada completed drilling of the aspy exploration well which did not encounter commercial quantities of hydrocarbons in january 2019 the partnership relinquished 50 of the nova scotia acreage in accordance with the license agreement timeline the retained acreage of approximately 175 million gross acres remains under evaluation we also hold a 25 participating interest in three bp canada operated exploration licenses offshore newfoundland 

 

 

 

sales commitments 

we have certain longterm contracts with fixed minimum sales volume commitments for natural gas and ngls production at the jda in the gulf of thailand we have annual minimum net sales commitments of approximately 80 billion cubic feet of natural gas per year through 2025 and approximately 40 billion cubic feet per year in 2026 and 2027 at the north malay basin development project offshore peninsular malaysia we have annual net sales commitments of approximately 55 billion cubic feet per year through 2024 our estimated total volume of production subject to these sales commitments is approximately 950 billion cubic feet of natural gas we also have ngls minimum delivery commitments primarily in the bakken through 2023 of approximately 10 million barrels per year or approximately 55 million barrels over the remaining life of the contracts

we have not experienced any significant constraints in satisfying the committed quantities required by our sales commitments and we anticipate being able to meet future requirements from available proved and probable reserves and projected thirdparty supply

other items 

emergency preparedness and response plans and procedures

we have in place a series of business and assetspecific emergency preparedness response and business continuity plans that detail procedures for rapid and effective emergency response and environmental mitigation activities these plans are maintained reviewed and updated as necessary to confirm their accuracy and suitability where applicable they are also reviewed and approved by the relevant host government authorities

responder training and drills are routinely held worldwide to assess and continually improve the effectiveness of our plans our contractors service providers representatives from government agencies and where applicable joint venture partners participate in the drills to help ensure that emergency procedures are comprehensive and can be effectively implemented

to complement internal capabilities and to help ensure coverage for our global operations we maintain membership contracts with a network of local regional and global oil spill response and emergency response organizations at the regional and global level these organizations include clean gulf associates cga marine spill response corporation msrc marine well containment company mwcc wild well control wwc subsea well intervention service swis and oil spill response limited osrl cga and msrc are domestic spill response organizations and mwcc provides the equipment and personnel to contain underwater well control incidents in the gulf of mexico wwc provides firefighting well control and engineering services globally osrl is a global response organization and is available when needed to assist us with any of our assets in addition to owning response assets in their own right the organization maintains business relationships that provide immediate access to additional critical response support services if required osrl’s response assets include nearly 300 recovery and storage vessels and barges more than 250 skimmers over 600000 feet of boom 9 capping stacks and significant quantities of dispersants and other ancillary equipment including aircraft in addition to external well control and oil spill response support we have contracts with wildlife environmental meteorology incident management medical and security resources if we were to engage these organizations to obtain additional critical response support services we would fund such services and where appropriate seek reimbursement under our insurance coverage as described below in certain circumstances we pursue and enter into mutual aid agreements with other companies and government cooperatives to receive and provide oil spill response equipment and personnel support we maintain close associations with emergency response organizations through our representation on the executive committees of cga and msrc as well as the board of directors of osrl

we continue to participate in several industrywide task forces that are studying better ways to assess the risk of and prevent onshore and offshore incidents access and control blowouts in subsea environments and improve containment and recovery methods the task forces are working closely with the oil and gas industry and international government agencies to implement improvements and increase the effectiveness of oil spill prevention preparedness response and recovery processes

insurance coverage and indemnification

we maintain insurance coverage that includes coverage for physical damage to our property thirdparty liability workers’ compensation and employers’ liability general liability sudden and accidental pollution and other coverage this insurance coverage is subject to deductibles exclusions and limitations and there is no assurance that such coverage will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences and damages 

the amount of insurance covering physical damage to our property and liability related to negative environmental effects resulting from a sudden and accidental pollution event excluding atlantic named windstorm coverage for which we are self‑insured varies by asset based on the assets estimated replacement value or the estimated maximum loss in the case of a catastrophic event first party coverage consists of two tiers of insurance the first 400 million of coverage is provided through an industry mutual insurance group above this 400 million threshold insurance is carried which ranges in value up to 111 billion in total depending on the asset coverage level as described above the insurance programs covering physical damage to our property exclude business interruption protection for our ep operations additionally we carry insurance that provides thirdparty coverage for general liability and sudden and accidental pollution up to 108 billion which coverage under a standard joint operating arrangement would be reduced to our participating interest

our insurance policies renew at various dates each year future insurance coverage could increase in cost and may include higher deductibles or retentions or additional exclusions or limitations in addition some forms of insurance may become unavailable in the future or unavailable on terms that are deemed economically acceptable

 

 

 

generally our drilling contracts and most of our other offshore services contracts provide for a mutual hold harmless indemnity structure whereby each party to the contract the corporation and contractor in demnifies the other party for injuries or damages to their personnel and property and often those of its contractorssubcontractors regardless of fault variations may include indemnity exclusions to the extent a claim is attributable to the gross neg ligence andor willful misconduct of a party third ‑party claims on the other hand are generally allocated on a fault basis 

we are customarily responsible for and indemnify the contractor against all claims including those from third‑parties to the extent attributable to pollution or contamination by substances originating from our reservoirs or other property and the contractor is responsible for and indemnifies us for all claims attributable to pollution emanating from the contractor’s property variations may include indemnity exclusions to the extent a claim is attributable to the gross negligence andor willful misconduct of a party additionally we are generally liable for all of our own losses and most third‑party claims associated with catastrophic losses such as damage to reservoirs blowouts cratering and loss of hole regardless of cause although exceptions for losses attributable to gross negligence andor willful misconduct do exist lastly some offshore services contracts include overall limitations of the contractor’s liability equal to a fixed negotiated amount variations may include exclusions of all contractual indemnities from the liability cap

under a standard joint operating agreement joa each party is liable for all claims arising under the joa to the extent of its participating interest operator or nonoperator variations include indemnity exclusions when the claim is based upon the gross negligence andor willful misconduct of the operator in which case the operator is solely liable the parties to the joa may continue to be jointly and severally liable for claims made by thirdparties in some jurisdictions further under some production sharing contracts between a governmental entity and commercial parties liability of the commercial parties to the government entity is joint and several

environmental

compliance with various existing environmental and pollution control regulations imposed by federal state local and foreign governments is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations but increasingly stringent environmental regulations have resulted and will likely continue to result in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us and the oil and gas industry in general we spent approximately 15 million in 2018 for environmental remediation the level of other expenditures to comply with federal state local and foreign country environmental regulations is difficult to quantify as such costs are captured as mostly indistinguishable components of our capital expenditures and operating expenses for further discussion of environmental matters see environment health and safety in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

 ite m 1a r isk factors 

our business activities and the value of our securities are subject to significant risks including the risk factors described below these risk factors could negatively affect our operations financial condition liquidity and results of operations and as a result holders and purchasers of our securities could lose part or all of their investments it is possible that additional risks relating to our securities may be described in a prospectus supplement if we issue securities in the future

our business and operating results are highly dependent on the market prices of crude oil ngls and natural gas which can be very volatile our estimated proved reserves revenue operating cash flows operating margins liquidity financial condition and future earnings are highly dependent on the benchmark market prices of crude oil ngls and natural gas and our associated realized price differentials which are volatile and influenced by numerous factors beyond our control the major foreign oil producing countries including members of opec may exert considerable influence over the supply and price of crude oil and refined petroleum products their ability or inability to agree on a common policy on rates of production and other matters may have a significant impact on the oil markets other factors include but are not limited to worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for crude oil ngls and natural gas political conditions and events including instability changes in governments armed conflict or economic sanctions around the world and in particular in crude oil or natural gas producing regions the cost of exploring for developing and producing crude oil ngls and natural gas the price and availability of alternative fuels or other forms of energy the effect of energy conservation and environmental protection efforts and overall economic conditions globally the sentiment of commodities trading markets as well as other supply and demand factors may also influence the selling prices of crude oil ngls and natural gas average prices for 2018 were 6490 per barrel for wti 2017 5085 2016 4347 and 7169 per barrel for brent 2017 5474 2016 4513 in order to manage the potential volatility of cash flows and credit requirements we maintain significant bank credit facilities an inability to access renew or replace such credit facilities or access other sources of funding as they mature would negatively impact our liquidity 

if we fail to successfully increase our reserves our future crude oil and natural gas production will be adversely impacted we own or have access to a finite amount of oil and gas reserves which will be depleted over time replacement of oil and gas production and reserves including proved undeveloped reserves is subject to successful exploration drilling development activities and enhanced recovery programs therefore future oil and gas production is dependent on technical success in finding and developing additional hydrocarbon reserves exploration activity involves the interpretation of seismic and other geological and geophysical data which does not always successfully predict the presence of commercial quantities of hydrocarbons drilling risks include unexpected adverse conditions irregularities in pressure or formations equipment failure blowouts and weather interruptions future developments may be affected by unforeseen reservoir conditions which negatively affect recovery factors or flow rates reserve replacement can also be achieved through acquisition similar risks however may be encountered in the production of oil and gas on properties acquired from others in addition to the technical risks to reserve replacement replacing reserves and developing future production is also influenced by the price of crude oil and natural gas and costs of drilling and development activities lower crude oil and natural gas prices may have the effect of reducing capital available for exploration and development activity and may render certain development projects uneconomic or delay their completion and may result in negative revisions to existing reserves while increasing drilling and development costs could negatively affect expected economic returns 

there are inherent uncertainties in estimating quantities of proved reserves and discounted future net cash flows and actual quantities may be lower than estimated numerous uncertainties exist in estimating quantities of proved reserves and future net revenues from those reserves actual future production oil and gas prices revenues taxes capital expenditures operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates and could materially affect the estimated quantities of our proved reserves and the related future net revenues in addition reserve estimates may be subject to downward or upward changes based on production performance purchases or sales of properties results of future development prevailing oil and gas prices production sharing contracts which may decrease reserves as crude oil and natural gas prices increase and other factors crude oil prices declined in 2016 relative to preceding years resulting in reductions to our reported proved reserves in contrast crude oil prices improved somewhat in 2017 and 2018 resulting in increases to our reported proved reserves if crude oil prices in 2019 average below prices used to determine proved reserves at december 31 2018 it could have an adverse effect on our estimates of proved reserve volumes and on the value of our business see crude oil and natural gas reserves in critical accounting policies and estimates in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

we do not always control decisions made under joint operating agreements and the parties under such agreements may fail to meet their obligations we conduct many of our ep operations through joint operating agreements with other parties under which we may not control decisions either because we do not have a controlling interest or are not operator under the agreement there is risk that these parties may at any time have economic business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours and therefore decisions may be made which are not what we believe is in our best interest moreover 

 

 

 

parties to these agreements may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone in either case the value of our investment may be adversely af fected 

we are subject to changing laws and regulations and other governmental actions that can significantly and adversely affect our business federal state local territorial and foreign laws and regulations relating to tax increases and retroactive tax claims disallowance of tax credits and deductions expropriation or nationalization of property mandatory government participation cancellation or amendment of contract rights imposition of capital controls or blocking of funds changes in import and export regulations reduction of sulfur content in bunker fuel the imposition of tariffs limitations on access to exploration and development opportunities antibribery or anticorruption laws as well as other political developments may affect our operations and financial results 

we have substantial capital requirements and we may not be able to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms if at all the exploration development and production of crude oil and natural gas involves substantial costs which may not be fully funded from operations two of the three major credit rating agencies that rate our debt have assigned an investment grade rating although currently we do not have any borrowings under our longterm credit facility a ratings downgrade continued weakness in the oil and gas industry or negative outcomes within commodity and financial markets could adversely impact our access to capital markets by increasing the costs of financing or by impacting our ability to obtain financing on satisfactory terms or at all in addition a ratings downgrade may require that we issue letters of credit or provide other forms of collateral under certain contractual requirements any inability to access capital markets could adversely impact our financial adaptability and our ability to execute our strategy and may also expose us to heightened exposure to credit risk 

political instability in areas where we operate can adversely affect our business some of the international areas in which we operate are politically less stable than other areas and may be subject to civil unrest conflict insurgency corruption security risks and labor unrest political instability and civil unrest in north africa south america and the middle east has affected and may continue to affect our interests in these areas as well as oil and gas markets generally in addition geographic territorial border disputes may affect our business in certain areas such as the border dispute between guyana and venezuela over a portion of the stabroek block political instability exposes our operations to increased risks including increased difficulty in obtaining required permits and government approvals enforcing our agreements in those jurisdictions and potential adverse actions by local government authorities the threat of terrorism around the world also poses additional risks to the operations of the oil and gas industry 

our oil and gas operations are subject to environmental risks and environmental laws and regulations that can result in significant costs and liabilities our oil and gas operations like those of the industry are subject to environmental risks such as oil spills produced water spills gas leaks and ruptures and discharges of substances or gases that could expose us to substantial liability for pollution or other environmental damage our operations are also subject to numerous us federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations non‑compliance with these laws and regulations may subject us to administrative civil or criminal penalties remedial cleanups and natural resource damages or other liabilities in addition increasingly stringent environmental regulations have resulted and will likely continue to result in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us and the oil and gas industry in general similarly we have material legal obligations to dismantle remove and abandon production facilities and wells that will occur many years in the future in most cases these estimates may be impacted by future changes in regulations and other uncertainties 

concerns have been raised in certain jurisdictions where we have operations concerning the safety and environmental impact of the drilling and development of shale oil and gas resources particularly hydraulic fracturing water usage flaring of associated natural gas and air emissions while we believe that these operations can be conducted safely and with minimal impact on the environment regulatory bodies are responding to these concerns and may impose moratoriums and new regulations on such drilling operations that would likely have the effect of prohibiting or delaying such operations and increasing their cost

climate change initiatives may result in significant operational changes and expenditures reduced demand for our products and adversely affect our business we recognize that climate change is a global environmental concern continuing political and social attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national regional or local legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions these agreements and measures may require or could result in future legislation and regulatory measures that require significant equipment modifications operational changes taxes or purchase of emission credits to reduce emission of greenhouse gases from our operations which may result in substantial capital expenditures and compliance operating maintenance and remediation costs in addition our production is sold to third parties that produce petroleum fuels which through normal end user consumption result in the emission of greenhouse gases regulatory initiatives to reduce the use of these fuels may reduce demand for crude oil and other hydrocarbons and have an adverse effect on our sales volumes revenues and margins the imposition and enforcement of stringent greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets could severely and adversely impact the oil and gas industry and significantly reduce the value of our business furthermore increasing attention to climate change risks has 

 

 

 

resulted in governmental investigations and public and private litigation which could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business for example in 2017 certain municipalities and private assoc iations in california rhode island and maryland separately filed lawsuits against over 30 fossil fuel producers including us for alleged damages purportedly caused by climate change 

our industry is highly competitive and many of our competitors are larger and have greater resources and more diverse portfolios than we have   the petroleum industry is highly competitive and very capital intensive we encounter competition from numerous companies including acquiring rights to explore for crude oil and natural gas to a lesser extent we are also in competition with producers of alternative fuels or other forms of energy including wind solar and electric power and in the future could face increasing competition due to the development and adoption of new technologies many competitors including national oil companies are larger and have substantially greater resources to acquire and develop oil and gas assets in addition competition for drilling services technical expertise and equipment may affect the availability of technical personnel and drilling rigs resulting in increased capital and operating costs many of our competitors have a more diverse portfolio of assets which may minimize the impact of adverse events occurring at any one location 

catastrophic events whether naturally occurring or man‑made may materially affect our operations and financial conditions our oil and gas operations are subject to unforeseen occurrences which have affected us from time to time and which may damage or destroy assets interrupt operations and have other significant adverse effects examples of catastrophic events include hurricanes fires explosions blowouts pipeline interruptions and ruptures severe weather geological events labor disputes or cyber‑attacks we maintain insurance coverage against many but not all potential losses and liabilities in amounts we deem prudent including for property and casualty losses there can be no assurance that such insurance will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences and damages moreover some forms of insurance may be unavailable in the future or be available only on terms that are deemed economically unacceptable 

significant time delays between the estimated and actual occurrence of critical events associated with development projects may result in material negative economic consequences as part of our business we are involved in large development projects the completion of which may be delayed beyond what was originally planned such examples include but are not limited to delays in receiving necessary approvals from project members or regulatory agencies timely access to necessary equipment availability of necessary personnel construction delays unfavorable weather conditions and equipment failures this may lead to delays and differences between estimated and actual timing of critical events these delays could impact our future results of operations and cash flows 

departures of key members from our senior management team andor difficulty in recruiting and retaining adequate numbers of experienced technical personnel could negatively impact our ability to deliver on our strategic goals our future success depends upon the continued service of key members of our senior management team who play an important role in developing and implementing our strategy the departure of key members of senior management or an inability to recruit and retain adequate numbers of experienced technical and professional personnel in the necessary locations may prevent us from executing our strategy in full or in part which could negatively impact our business 

we are dependent on oilfield service companies for items including drilling rigs equipment supplies and skilled labor an inability or significant delay in securing these services or a high cost thereof may result in material negative economic consequences the availability and cost of drilling rigs equipment supplies and skilled labor will fluctuate over time given the cyclical nature of the ep industry as a result we may encounter difficulties in obtaining required services or could face an increase in cost these consequences may impact our ability to run our operations and to deliver projects on time with the potential for material negative economic consequences 

we manage commodity price and other risks through our risk management function but such activities may impede our ability to benefit from commodity price increases and can expose us to similar potential counterparty credit risk as amounts due from the sale of hydrocarbons we may enter into additional commodity price hedging arrangements to protect us from commodity price declines these arrangements may depending on the instruments used and the level of additional hedges involved limit any potential upside from commodity price increases as with accounts receivable from the sale of hydrocarbons we may be exposed to potential economic loss should a counterparty be unable or unwilling to perform their obligations under the terms of a hedging agreement in addition we are exposed to risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency values and may engage in hedging activities to mitigate related volatility 

one of our subsidiaries is the general partner of a publicly traded master limited partnership hess midstream partners lp the responsibilities associated with being a general partner expose us to a broader range of legal liabilities  our control of hess midstream partners lp bestows upon us additional fiduciary duties including but not limited to the obligations associated with managing potential conflicts of interests additional reporting requirements from the securities and exchange commission and the provision of tax information to unit holders of hess midstream partners lp these heightened 

 

 

 

duties expose us to additional potential for legal claims that may have a material negative economic impact on our shareholders moreover these increased duties may lead to an increase in compliance costs 

disruption failure or cyber security breaches affecting or targeting computer telecommunications systems and infrastructure used by the company may materially impact our business and operations computers and telecommunication systems are used to conduct our exploration development and production activities and have become an integral part of our business we use these systems to analyze and store financial and operating data and to communicate within our company and with outside business partners technical system flaws power loss cyber security risks including cyber or phishingattacks unauthorized access malicious software data privacy breaches by employees or others with authorized access ransomware and other cyber security issues could compromise our computer and telecommunications systems and result in disruptions to our business operations or the access disclosure or loss of our data and proprietary information in addition computers control oil and gas production processing equipment and distribution systems globally and are necessary to deliver our production to market a disruption failure or a cyber breach of these operating systems or of the networks and infrastructure on which they rely could damage critical production distribution andor storage assets delay or prevent delivery to markets and make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transactions as a result a disruption failure or a cyber breach of these operating systems or of the networks and infrastructure on which they rely and any resulting investigation or remediation costs litigation or regulatory action could have a material adverse impact on our cash flows and results of operations reputation and competitiveness we routinely experience attempts by external parties to penetrate and attack our networks and systems although such attempts to date have not resulted in any material breaches disruptions financial loss or loss of businesscritical information our systems and procedures for protecting against such attacks and mitigating such risks may prove to be insufficient in the future and such attacks could have an adverse impact on our business and operations including damage to our reputation and competitiveness remediation costs litigation or regulatory actions in addition as technologies evolve and these cyber security attacks become more sophisticated we may incur significant costs to upgrade or enhance our security measures to protect against such attacks and we may face difficulties in fully anticipating or implementing adequate preventive measures or mitigating potential harm

 item 3 legal proceedings

we along with many companies that have been or continue to be engaged in refining and marketing of gasoline have been a party to lawsuits and claims related to the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe in gasoline a series of similar lawsuits many involving water utilities or governmental entities were filed in jurisdictions across the us against producers of mtbe and petroleum refiners who produced gasoline containing mtbe including us the principal allegation in all cases was that gasoline containing mtbe was a defective product and that these producers and refiners are strictly liable in proportion to their share of the gasoline market for damage to groundwater resources and are required to take remedial action to ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of releases of mtbe the majority of the cases asserted against us have been settled there are three remaining active cases filed by pennsylvania rhode island and maryland in june 2014 the commonwealth of pennsylvania filed a lawsuit alleging that we and all major oil companies with operations in pennsylvania have damaged the groundwater by introducing thereto gasoline with mtbe the pennsylvania suit has been forwarded to the existing mtbe multidistrict litigation pending in the southern district of new york in september 2016 the state of rhode island also filed a lawsuit alleging that we and other major oil companies damaged the groundwater in rhode island by introducing thereto gasoline with mtbe the suit filed in rhode island is proceeding in federal court in december 2017 the state of maryland filed a lawsuit alleging that we and other major oil companies damaged the groundwater in maryland by introducing thereto gasoline with mtbe the suit filed in maryland state court was served on us in january 2018 and has been removed to federal court by the defendants

in september 2003 we received a directive from the new jersey department of environmental protection njdep to remediate contamination in the sediments of the lower passaic river the njdep is also seeking natural resource damages the directive insofar as it affects us relates to alleged releases from a petroleum bulk storage terminal in newark new jersey we previously owned we and over 70 companies entered into an administrative order on consent with the environmental protection agency epa to study the same contamination this work remains ongoing we and other parties settled a cost recovery claim by the state of new jersey and also agreed with epa to fund remediation of a portion of the site on march 4 2016 the epa issued a record of decision rod in respect of the lower eight miles of the lower passaic river selecting a remedy that includes banktobank dredging at an estimated cost of 138 billion the rod does not address the upper nine miles of the lower passaic river or the newark bay which may require additional remedial action in addition the federal trustees for natural resources have begun a separate assessment of damages to natural resources in the passaic river given that the epa has not selected a remedy for the entirety of the lower passaic river or the newark bay total remedial costs 

 

 

 

cannot be reliably estimated at this time based on currently known facts and circumstances we do not believe that this matter will result in a significant liability to us because our former terminal did not store or use contaminants which are of concern in the river sediments and could not have contributed contamination along the river’s length further there are numerous other parties who we expect will bear the cost of remediation and damages 

in march 2014 we received an administrative order from epa requiring us and 26 other parties to undertake the remedial design for the remedy selected by the epa for the gowanus canal superfund site in brooklyn new york the remedy includes dredging of surface sediments and the placement of a cap over the deeper sediments throughout the canal and insitu stabilization of certain contaminated sediments that will remain in place below the cap epa has estimated that this remedy will cost 506 million however the ultimate costs that will be incurred in connection with the design and implementation of the remedy remain uncertain our alleged liability derives from our former ownership and operation of a fuel oil terminal and connected shipbuilding and repair facility adjacent to the canal we indicated to epa that we would comply with the administrative order and are currently contributing funding for the remedial design based on an interim allocation of costs among the parties at the same time we are participating in an allocation process whereby a neutral expert selected by the parties will determine the final shares of the remedial design costs to be paid by each of the participants 

on september 28 2017 we received a general notice letter and offer to settle from the us environmental protection agency relating to superfund claims for the ector drum inc superfund site in odessa texas the epa and texas commission on environmental quality tceq took cleanup and response action at the site commencing in 2014 and concluded in december 2015 the site was determined to have improperly stored industrial waste including drums with oily liquids the total cleanup cost incurred by the epa was approximately 35 million we were invited to negotiate a voluntary settlement for our purported share of the cleanup costs our share if any is undetermined 

we periodically receive notices from the epa that we are a “potential responsible party” under the superfund legislation with respect to various waste disposal sites under this legislation all potentially responsible parties may be jointly and severally liable for certain sites such as those discussed above the epa’s claims or assertions of liability against us relating to these sites have not been fully developed with respect to the remaining sites the epa’s claims have been settled or a proposed settlement is under consideration in all cases for amounts that are not material the ultimate impact of these proceedings and of any related proceedings by private parties on our business or accounts cannot be predicted at this time due to the large number of other potentially responsible parties and the speculative nature of cleanup cost estimates but is not expected to be material

from time to time we are involved in other judicial and administrative proceedings including proceedings relating to other environmental matters we cannot predict with certainty if how or when such proceedings will be resolved or what the eventual relief if any may be particularly for proceedings that are in their early stages of development or where plaintiffs seek indeterminate damages numerous issues may need to be resolved including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters before a loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated for any proceeding

subject to the foregoing in management’s opinion based upon currently known facts and circumstances the outcome of the aforementioned proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

overview 

hess corporation incorporated in the state of delaware in 1920 is a global exploration and production ep company engaged in exploration development production transportation purchase and sale of crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas with production operations located primarily in the united states us denmark the malaysiathailand joint development area jda and malaysia we conduct exploration activities primarily offshore guyana suriname canada and in the us gulf of mexico at the stabroek block hess 30 offshore guyana we have participated in twelve significant discoveries the liza phase 1 development was sanctioned in 2017 and is expected to startup in early 2020 with production reaching up to 120000 gross bopd the discovered resources to date on the stabroek block are expected to underpin the potential for at least five fpsos producing more than 750000 gross bopd by 2025

our midstream operating segment provides feebased services including gathering compressing and processing natural gas and fractionating ngls gathering terminaling loading and transporting crude oil and ngls storing and terminaling propane and water handling services primarily in the bakken and three forks shale plays in the williston basin area of north dakota

in 2018 we completed the sale of our joint venture interests in the utica shale play in eastern ohio onshore us and during 2017 we sold our interests in equatorial guinea norway and our enhanced oil recovery assets in the permian basin onshore us these sales which generated total proceeds of approximately 35 billion are consistent with our strategy to high grade our portfolio by divesting lower return mature assets to invest in higher return assets primarily in guyana and the bakken and to provide returns to shareholders during 2018 we repurchased 138 billion of common stock 2017 120 million repaid debt of 633 million and paid dividends of 345 million at december 31 2018 we had cash and cash equivalents of 26 billion excluding midstream

outlook

we project our ep capital and exploratory expenditures will be approximately 29 billion in 2019 capital investment for our midstream operations is expected to be approximately 330 million oil and gas production in 2019 is forecast to be in the range of 270000 boepd to 280000 boepd excluding libya up from 248000 boepd in 2018 excluding libya and assets sold we have purchased crude oil put options for calendar year 2019 that establish a wti monthly floor price of 60 per barrel for 95000 bopd

net cash provided by operating activities was 1939 million in 2018 compared to 945 million in 2017 while capital expenditures for 2018 and 2017 were 2180 million and 1973 million respectively based on current forward strip crude oil prices for 2019 we expect cash flow from operating activities and cash and cash equivalents existing at december 31 2018 will be sufficient to fund our capital investment program and dividends through the end of 2019

consolidated results

net loss attributable to hess corporation was 282 million in 2018 2017 4074 million 2016 6132 million excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods summarized on page 26 the adjusted net loss was 176 million in 2018 2017 1401 million 2016 1489 million annual production averaged 277000 boepd in 2018 2017 306000 boepd 2016 322000 boepd total proved reserves were 1192 million boe at december 31 2018 2017 1154 million boe 2016 1109 million boe 

 

 

significant 2018 activities 

the following is an update of significant ep activities during 2018

producing ep assets







we forecast gulf of thailand net production for full year 2019 to be in the range of 60000 boepd and 65000 boepd 



other ep assets



phase 2 of the liza field development is expected to start production by mid2022 pending government and regulatory approvals project sanction for phase 2 is expected by the operator in the first quarter of 2019 and will include a second fpso vessel designed to produce up to 220000 gross bopd project sanction for a third phase of development at the payara field is expected in 2019 with first production expected to start up as early as 2023 in addition to the first three phases development planning is underway for additional fpsos the ultimate sizing and timing will be a function of further exploration and appraisal drilling

the operator is currently utilizing three drillships on the block the stena carron and the noble tom madden which arrived in the third quarter of 2018 are involved in exploration and appraisal drilling the noble bob douglas is drilling development wells for liza phase 1 in 2018 the following explorations wells were drilled on the stabroek block in chronological order

ranger1 the well located approximately 60 miles northwest of the liza discovery encountered approximately 230 feet of highquality oilbearing carbonate reservoir 

pacora1  the well encountered approximately 65 feet of highquality oilbearing sandstone reservoir and is located approximately four miles west of the payara1 well which was drilled in 2017 the operator plans to integrate this discovery into the payara field development 

liza5 the well encountered 77 feet of highquality oilbearing sandstone reservoir and is located approximately six miles northwest of the liza1 well which was drilled in 2016 

 

 

sorubim1 the well did not encounter commercial quantities of hydrocarbons 

longtail1  the well encountered approximately 256 feet of highquality oilbearing sandstone reservoir and is located approximately five miles west of the turbot1 well which was drilled in 2017 

hammerhead1 the well encountered approximately 197 feet of highquality oilbearing sandstone reservoir and is located approximately 13 miles to the southwest of the liza1 well 

pluma1 the well encountered approximately 121 feet of highquality hydrocarbonbearing sandstone reservoir and represents the tenth discovery on the block the well is located approximately 17 miles south of the turbot1 well 

in february 2019 the operator announced the eleventh and twelfth discoveries on the stabroek block at the tilapia1 and haimara1 wells the tilapia1 well encountered approximately 305 feet of highquality oilbearing sandstone reservoir and is located approximately three miles west of the longtail1 well the haimara1 well encountered approximately 207 feet of highquality gas condensatebearing sandstone reservoir and is located approximately 19 miles east of the pluma1 well

consoli dated results of operations 

results by segment

the aftertax income loss by major operating activity is summarized below

 





in the following discussion and elsewhere in this report the financial effects of certain transactions are disclosed on an aftertax basis management reviews segment earnings on an aftertax basis and uses aftertax amounts in its review of variances in segment earnings management believes that aftertax amounts are a preferable method of explaining variances in earnings since they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only the pretax amount aftertax amounts are determined by applying the income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pretax amounts

items affecting comparability of earnings between periods

the following table summarizes items of income expense that are included in net income loss and affect comparability of earnings between periods the items in the table below are explained on pages 31 through 35



the following table reconciles reported net income loss attributable to hess corporation and adjusted net income loss



adjusted net income loss attributable to hess corporation presented in this report is a nongaap financial measure which we define as reported net income loss attributable to hess corporation excluding items identified as affecting comparability of earnings between periods management uses adjusted net income loss to evaluate the corporation’s operating performance and believes that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this measure which excludes certain items that management believes are not directly related to ongoing operations and are not indicative of future business trends and operations this measure is not and should not be viewed as a substitute for us gaap net income loss

comparison of results

exploration and production

following is a summarized statement of income for our ep operations

 



 

excluding the ep items affecting comparability of earnings between periods in the table on page 31 the changes in ep results are primarily attributable to changes in selling prices production and sales volumes marketing expenses cash operating costs midstream tariffs depreciation depletion and amortization exploration expenses and income taxes as discussed below

 

 

selling prices average worldwide realized crude oil selling prices including hedging were 23 higher in 2018 compared to the prior year primarily due to the increase in brent and wti crude oil prices in addition realized worldwide selling prices for ngls increased in 2018 by 19 and worldwide natural gas prices increased in 2018 by 24  compared to the prior year in total higher realized selling prices improved 2018 financial results by approximately 700 million after income taxes compared with 2017 our average selling prices were as follows 





net realized losses from crude oil hedging contracts reduced sales and other operating revenues by 183 million 183 million after income taxes in 2018 and 59 million 59 million after income taxes in 2017 there were no crude oil hedge contracts in 2016 we have purchased crude oil put options for calendar year 2019 that establish a wti monthly floor price of 60 per barrel on 95000 bopd for 116 million which will be amortized on a straightline basis during 2019 

 

 

production volumes our daily worldwide net production was as follows 



in 2019 we expect net production excluding libya to average between 270000 boepd and 280000 boepd compared to full year pro forma 2018 net production excluding libya and assets sold of 248000 boepd 

production variances related to 2018 2017 and 2016 are summarized as follows

united states   bakken net production was higher in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to increased drilling activity and improved well performance in the current year the yearonyear decline in us other onshore production in 2018 and 2017 reflects the sale of our interests in the utica shale play in august 2018 and the sale of our permian assets in august 2017 total us offshore oil production was higher in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to the stampede and penn state fields partially offset by the impact of downtime from a planned well workover at the tubular bells field the shutdown at the thirdparty operated enchilada platform and natural field decline total offshore production was lower in 2017 compared to 2016 due to shutin production from the fire at the thirdparty operated enchilada platform and natural field decline p artially offset by higher production from the tubular bells field production from utica averaged 9000 boepd for calendar year 2018 2017 19000 boepd 2016 29000 boepd production from the permian averaged net 4000 boepd for calendar year 2017 2016 7000 boepd   

europe total net production was lower in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to the sale of our interests in norway in december 2017 crude oil and natural gas production was lower in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to natural field decline  production in norway averaged 24000 boepd in 2017 2016 28000 boepd 

 

 

africa crude oil production was lower in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily reflecting the sale of equatorial guinea in november 20 17 partially offset by higher production in libya  crude oil production in 2017 was comparable to 2016 as lower volumes from equatorial guinea were offset by higher production in libya  production in equatorial guinea averaged 25000 boepd in 2017 201 6 33000 boepd production in libya was 20000 boepd in 2018 2017 10000 boepd 2016 1000 boepd 

asia   natural gas production was higher in 2018 compared to 2017 and in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to first production at the north malay basin fullfield development in july 2017 

sales volumes the impact of lower sales volumes primarily due to asset sales decreased aftertax results by approximately 150 million in 2018 compared to 2017 worldwide sales volumes from hess net production excluding sales volumes of crude oil ngls and natural gas purchased from thirdparties were as follows 



marketing including purchased oil and gas   marketing expense is mainly comprised of costs to purchase crude oil ngls and natural gas from our partners in hess operated wells or other thirdparties primarily in the us and transportation and other distribution costs for us marketing activities the increases in 2018 compared to 2017 and in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily reflect the impact of higher benchmark crude oil prices on the cost of purchased volumes 

cash operating costs   cash operating costs consisting of operating costs and expenses production and severance taxes and ep general and administrative expenses decreased by 221 million in 2018 compared to the prior year 2017 404 million decrease versus 2016 the decrease in 2018 compared to 2017 is primarily due to asset sales and cost savings initiatives partially offset by higher production taxes in the bakken  the decrease in 2017 compared to 2016 is due to lower workover expenses lease operating and employee costs partially offset by higher production taxes in the bakken operating costs in 2016 include higher workover costs to replace failed subsurface valves in the gulf of mexico 

midstream tariffs expense tariffs expense in 2018 increased compared to 2017 primarily due to higher throughput volumes and water disposal activity in 2018 partially offset by lower costs from our former business in the permian tariffs expense in 2017 increased compared to 2016 primarily due to higher shortfall fees in 2017 for 2019 we estimate midstream tariffs expense to be in the range of 750 million to 775 million 

depreciation depletion and amortization depreciation depletion and amortization dda costs decreased by 988 million in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to the sale of assets which had higher dda rates than the portfolio average a lower dda rate at the bakken due to yearend 2017 proved reserve additions and the impact of prior year asset impairments   dda costs decreased by 377 million in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to lower production and an improved portfolio average dda rate due to the production mix 

unit costs unit cost per boe information is based on total ep production volumes and excludes items affecting comparability of earnings as disclosed below actual and forecast unit costs are as follows 









 

 

exploration expenses   exploration expenses including items affect ing comparability of earnings described below  were as follows 





exploration expenses were lower in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to lower dry hole expense and lower geologic and seismic costs exploration expenses were lower in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to lower dry hole expense leasehold impairment expense geologic and seismic costs and employee expenses see items affecting comparability of earnings between periods described below for 2019 we estimate exploration expenses excluding dry hole expense to be in the range of 200 million to 220 million

midstream

following is a summarized statement of income for our midstream operations which include results for a gas plant and associated co 2 assets in the permian basin through august 2017 and water handling services in north dakota that are whollyowned by hess







sales and other operating revenues in 2018 increased compared to 2017 primarily due to higher throughput volumes and water disposal activity in 2018 partially offset by prior year activity associated with our former permian assets that were sold in august 2017 sales and other operating revenues in 2017 increased compared to 2016 primarily due to higher shortfall fees earned and higher tariff rates and throughput volumes  partially offset by lower rail export revenue associated with thirdparty rail charges and the sale of our permian assets in august 2017

operating costs and expenses in 2018 reflect increased activity related to produced water disposal services and lower costs from our former permian assets versus the prior year operating costs and expenses were lower in 2017 compared to 2016 p rimarily due to lower thirdparty rail charges and the sale of our permian assets in august 2017  dda expenses were higher in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to pipeline assets that were brought into service in the current year

the increase in interest expense in 2018 compared to 2017 and 2017 compared to 2016 reflects higher borrowings by hess infrastructure partners lp

for 2019 we estimate net income attributable to hess corporation from the midstream segment to be in the range of 170 million to 180 million 

 

 

items affecting comparability of earnings between periods we recognized a pretax loss of 57 million 34 million after income taxes and noncontrolling interest in 2017 related to t he sale of our midstream assets in the permian basin midstream results in 2016 included a pretax charge of 67 million 21 million after income taxes and noncontrolling interest to impair older specification rail cars 

corporate interest and other

the following table summarizes corporate interest and other expenses



corporate and other expenses excluding items affecting comparability were lower in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to lower employee related costs nonservice pension costs and legal fees corporate and other expenses excluding items affecting comparability were higher in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to higher legal costs increased pension settlement charges in 2017 and the recognition of a nonrecurring gain of 8 million in 2016  in 2019 aftertax corporate and other expenses excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods are estimated to be in the range of 105 million to 115 million 

interest expense was lower in 2018 compared to 2017 due to lower average borrowings capitalized interest was lower in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to the stampede field commencing production in january 2018 interest expense was higher in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to slightly higher average borrowings capitalized interest expense was higher in 2017 compared to 2016 due to increased activity at the hess operated stampede development project and sanction of the liza field phase 1 development project during 2017 in 2019 aftertax interest expense net is estimated to be in the range of 315 million to 325 million

excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods the benefit for income taxes is lower in 2018 and 2017 compared to 2016 due to us generally not recognizing deferred tax benefit or expense in the us while we maintain valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets in accordance with the requirements of us accounting standards this accounting treatment commenced on december 31 2016 see items affecting comparability of earnings below and critical accounting policies and estimates – income taxes beginning on page 39

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table sets forth certain relevant measures of our liquidity and capital resources at december 31









cash flows

the following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows



operating activities  in 2018 net cash provided by operating activities increased compared to 2017 primarily due to higher benchmark crude oil prices and lower operating costs partially offset by lower production volumes largely due to asset sales in 2017 operating cash flows increased compared to 2016 primarily due to higher benchmark crude oil prices and lower operating costs partially offset by lower production volumes 

changes in working capital in 2018 reduced cash by 186 million 2017 780 million reduction 2016 47 million reduction primarily from premiums on crude oil hedge contracts and abandonment expenditures changes in working capital in 2017 included increased accounts receivable due to higher crude oil prices abandonment expenditures premiums on crude oil hedge contracts pension contributions contract termination payments for an offshore drilling rig and crude oil delivered as line fill 

investing activities total addition to property plant and equipment were 2097 million in 2018 2017 1937 million 2016 2251 million the increase in additions to property plant and equipment in 2018 compared to 2017 is primarily related to increased expenditures in the bakken offshore guyana offshore canada and in our midstream segment primarily offset by the impact of prior year asset sales and reduced development expenditure in both the gulf of mexico and malaysia in 2017 additions to property plant and equipment were lower compared to 2016 primarily due to lower development expenditures at north malay basin  partially offset by increased investments in bakken and guyana in 2017 in 2018 midstream equity investments in its 5050 joint venture with targa resources were 67 million p roceeds from the sale of assets of 607 million in 2018 2017 3296 million 2016 140 million include the divestiture of our joint venture interests in the utica shale play in eastern ohio and our share of proceeds from the sale and leaseback transaction of the north malay basin floating storage and offloading vessel 

financing activities r epayments of debt were 633 million in 2018 2017 459 million 2016 1455 million while b orrowings of debt with maturities in excess of 90 days were 800 million in 2017 and 1496 million in 2016 we settled common stock purchases in the amount of 1365 million in 2018 2017 110 million common and preferred stock dividends paid were 345 million in 2018 2017 363 million 2016 350 million in 2017 hess midstream partners lp received 

 

 

proceeds of 3655 million from the issuance of common units in an initial public offering of which 350 million was distributed equally to hess corporation and gip net outflows to noncontrolling interests were 211 million in 2018 2017 243 million net outflow 2016 23 million net outflow in 2016 we issued 28750000 shares of common stock and depositary shares representing 575000 shares of 8 series a mandatory convertible preferred stock for total net proceeds of 164 billion  

future capital requirements and resources

at december 31 2018 hess corporation had 26 billion in cash and cash equivalents excluding midstream and total liquidity including available committed credit facilities of approximately 70 billion the corporation has no significant nearterm debt maturities we have purchased crude oil put options for calendar year 2019 that establish a wti monthly floor price of 60 per barrel for 95000 bopd 

net production in 2019 is forecast to be in the range of 270000 boepd to 280000 boepd excluding libya and we expect our 2019 ep capital and exploratory expenditures will be approximately 29 billion  based on current forward strip crude oil prices for 2019 we expect cash flow from operating activities and cash and cash equivalents existing at december 31 2018 will be sufficient to fund our capital investment program and dividends through the end of 2019 

the table below summarizes the capacity usage and available capacity of our borrowing and letter of credit facilities at december 31 2018











the corporation’s 40 billion syndicated revolving credit facility expires in january 2021 with commitments of 37 billion available for the final year borrowings on the facility will generally bear interest at 130 above the london interbank offered rate libor the interest rate will be higher if our credit rating is lowered the facility contains a financial covenant that limits the amount of the total borrowings on the last day of each fiscal quarter to 60 of the corporation’s total capitalization defined as total debt plus stockholders’ equity at december 31 2018 hess corporation had no outstanding borrowings or letters of credit under this facility and was in compliance with this financial covenant 

we had 284 million in letters of credit outstanding at december 31 2018 2017 246 million which primarily relate to our international operations see also note 21 financial risk management activities in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

we also have a shelf registration under which we may issue additional debt securities warrants common stock or preferred stock

at december 31 2018 hip has 800 million of senior secured syndicated credit facilities maturing november 2022 consisting of a 600 million 5year revolving credit facility and a drawn 200 million 5year term loan a facility the revolving credit facility can be used for borrowings and letters of credit to fund the joint venture’s operating activities and capital expenditures borrowings under the 5year term loan a facility will generally bear interest at libor plus an applicable margin ranging from 155 to 250 while the applicable margin for the 5year syndicated revolving credit facility ranges from 1275 to 2000 the interest rate is subject to adjustment based on hip’s leverage ratio which is calculated as total debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda if hip obtains an investment grade credit rating as defined in the amended credit agreement pricing levels will be based on the credit ratings in effect from time 

 

 

to time the credit facilities contain financial covenants that generally require a leverage ratio of no more than 50 to 10 for the prior four fiscal quarters and an interest cov erage ratio which is calculated as ebitda to cash interest expense of no less than 225 to 10 for the prior four fiscal quarters the amended credit agreement includes a secured leverage ratio test not to exceed 375 to 100 for so long as the faciliti es remain secured hip is in compliance with these financial covenants at december 31 2018 outstanding borrowings under this credit facility are nonrecourse to hess corporation at december 31 2018 hip’s revolving credit facility was undrawn and bo rrowings under the term loan a facility amounted to 1975 million excluding deferred issuance costs the credit facilities are secured by firstpriority perfected liens on substantially all of hip’s and certain of its whollyowned subsidiaries’ directly owned assets including its equity interests in certain subsidiaries subject to customary exclusions 

hess midstream partners lp the “partnership” has a 300 million 4year senior secured syndicated revolving credit facility that became available for utilization at completion of its initial public offering in april 2017 the credit facility can be used for borrowings and letters of credit to fund operating activities and capital expenditures of the partnership and expires march 2021 borrowings on the credit facility will generally bear interest at libor plus an applicable margin of 1275 the interest rate is subject to adjustment based on the partnership’s leverage ratio which is calculated as total debt to ebitda if the partnership obtains credit ratings pricing levels will be based on the credit ratings in effect from time to time the partnership is subject to customary covenants in the credit agreement including financial covenants that generally require a leverage ratio of no more than 45 to 10 for the prior four fiscal quarters the credit facility is secured by first priority perfected liens on substantially all directly owned assets of the partnership and its whollyowned subsidiaries including equity interests in subsidiaries subject to certain customary exclusions outstanding borrowings under this credit facility are nonrecourse to hess corporation at december 31 2018 this facility was undrawn

credit ratings

two of the three major credit rating agencies that rate the corporation’s debt have assigned an investment grade rating at december 31 2018 we have investment grade credit ratings from standard and poor’s ratings services bbb and fitch ratings bbb moody’s investors service has rated our debt at ba1 the consequence of lower credit ratings is an increase in interest rates and facility fees on our credit facilities and the potential for additional required collateral under operating agreements which are not material

at december 31 2018 hip’s senior unsecured debt is rated bb by standard and poor’s ratings services ba3 by moody’s investors service and bb by fitch ratings

contractual obligations and contingencies

the following table shows aggregate information about certain contractual obligations at december 31 2018









capital expenditures represent amounts that we were contractually committed at december 31 2018 including the portion of our planned capital expenditure program for 2019 obligations for operating expenses include commitments for oil and gas production expenses seismic purchases and other normal business expenses other liabilities reflect contractually committed obligations in the consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2018 including pension plan liabilities and estimates for uncertain income tax positions the corporation and certain of its subsidiaries lease drilling rigs support vessels office space and other assets for varying periods under leases accounted for as operating leases

 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

at december 31 2018 we had 284 million in letters of credit see also note 19 guarantees contingencies and commitments in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

foreign operations

we conduct ep activities outside the us principally in the joint development area of malaysiathailand and malaysia denmark libya guyana suriname and canada therefore we are subject to the risks associated with foreign operations including political risk tax law changes currency risk corruption and acts of terrorism see item 1a risk factors for further details

critical accounting policies and estimates

accounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and revenues and expenses in the statement of consolidated income  the accounting methods used can affect net income equity and various financial statement ratios however our accounting policies generally do not change cash flows or liquidity

accounting for exploration and development costs ep activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage including lease bonuses brokers’ fees and other related costs are capitalized annual lease rentals exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred costs of drilling and equipping productive wells including development dry holes and related production facilities are capitalized 

the costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if 1 the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and 2 sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operational viability of the project if either of those criteria is not met or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project the capitalized well costs are charged to expense indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves and the economic and operating viability of a project include commitment of project personnel active negotiations for sales contracts with customers negotiations with governments operators and contractors and firm plans for additional drilling and other factors

crude oil and natural gas reserves the determination of estimated proved reserves is a significant element in arriving at the results of operations of ep activities the estimates of proved reserves affect well capitalizations the unit of production depreciation rates of proved properties and wells and equipment as well as impairment testing of oil and gas assets 

for reserves to be booked as proved they must be determined with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations in addition government and project operator approvals must be obtained and depending on the amount of the project cost senior management or the board of directors must commit to fund the project we maintain our own internal reserve estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work directly with the oil and gas properties our technical staff updates reserve estimates throughout the year based on evaluations of new wells performance reviews new technical data and other studies to provide consistency throughout the corporation standard reserve estimation guidelines definitions reporting reviews and approval practices are used the internal reserve estimates are subject to internal technical audits and senior management review we also engage an independent thirdparty consulting firm to audit approximately 80 of our total proved reserves each year

proved reserves are calculated using the average price during the twelvemonth period ending december 31 determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the price on the first day of each month within the year unless prices are defined by contractual agreements excluding escalations based on future conditions as discussed in item 1a risk factors  crude oil prices are volatile which can have an impact on our proved reserves if crude oil prices in 2019 are at levels below that used in determining 2018 proved reserves we may recognize negative revisions to our december 31 2019 proved undeveloped reserves in addition we may recognize negative revisions to proved developed reserves which can vary significantly by asset due to differing operating cost structures conversely price increases in 2019 above those used in determining 2018 proved reserves could result in positive revisions to proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves at december 31 2019 it is difficult to estimate the magnitude of any potential net negative or positive change in proved reserves at december 31 2019 due to numerous currently unknown factors including 2019 crude oil prices any revisions based on 2019 reservoir performance and the levels to which industry costs will change in response to movements in commodity prices a 10 change in proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves at december 31 2018 would result in an approximate 200 million pretax change in depreciation depletion and amortization expense for 2019 based on projected production volumes see the supplementary oil and gas data on pages 82 through 92 in the accompanying financial statements for additional information on our oil and gas reserves

 

 

midstream joint venture we consolidate the activities of our 5050 joint venture hip which qualifies as a variable interest entity vie under us generally accepted accounting principles we have concluded that we are the primary benefic iary of the vie as defined in the accounting standards since we have the power through our 50 ownership to direct those activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of hip and are obligated to absorb losses or have the right to re ceive benefits that could potentially be significant to hip this conclusion was based on a qualitative analysis that considered hip’s governance structure the commercial agreements between hip and us and the voting rights established between the member s which provide us the ability to control the operations of hip 

impairment of longlived assets we review long‑lived assets including oil and gas fields for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered long‑lived assets are tested based on identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities if the carrying amounts of the longlived assets are not expected to be recovered by estimated undiscounted future net cash flows the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded the amount of impairment is determined based on the estimated fair value of the assets generally determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows an income valuation approach or by a market‑based valuation approach which are level 3 fair value measurements 

in the case of oil and gas fields the present value of future net cash flows is based on management’s best estimate of future prices which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices applied to projected production volumes and discounted at a riskadjusted rate the projected production volumes represent reserves including probable reserves expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures the production volumes prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairment will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows since the standardized measure requires the use of historical twelvemonth average prices 

our impairment tests of longlived ep producing assets are based on our best estimates of future production volumes including recovery factors selling prices operating and capital costs the timing of future production and other factors which are updated each time an impairment test is performed while crude oil prices in 2018 were higher than the last few years we could experience an asset impairment in the future if the projected production volumes from oil and gas fields decrease crude oil and natural gas selling prices decline significantly for an extended period or future estimated capital and operating costs increase significantly

impairment of goodwill goodwill is tested for impairment annually on october 1 st or when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable we conduct the goodwill test at a reporting unit level which is defined in accounting standards as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment the reporting unit or units used in an evaluation and measurement of goodwill for impairment testing are determined from several factors including the manner in which the business is managed at december 31 2018 our midstream operating segment had goodwill of 360 million that resulted from an allocation from our ep segment upon the formation of the midstream segment in 2015 our ep segment has no goodwill at december 31 2018 

to determine whether an indicator of impairment exists the fair value of a reporting unit is compared with its carrying amount including goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill is not impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value an impairment charge would be recorded for the excess of the carrying value over fair value limited by the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit 

fair value for the midstream operating segment is based on a market approach whereby the market capitalization of hess midstream partners lp’s the partnership which represents an approximate 20 economic interest in the operating companies that comprise the midstream segment is adjusted to an amount equal to a 100 economic interest in the operating companies based on the partnership’s stock price at the time of the impairment test other adjustments made to compute fair value include estimating the fair value of other minor midstream assets not owned by the partnership and longterm debt held directly by hip

income taxes judgments are required in the determination and recognition of income tax assets and liabilities in the financial statements these judgments include the requirement to only recognize the financial statement effect of a tax position when management believes that it is more likely than not that based on the technical merits the position will be sustained upon examination 

we have net operating loss carryforwards or credit carryforwards in multiple jurisdictions and have recorded deferred tax assets for those losses and credits additionally we have deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized if when tested under the relevant accounting standards it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized 

 

 

the accounting standards require the evaluation of all available positive and negative evidence giving weight based on the evidence’s relative objectivity in evaluating potential sources of positive evidence we consider the reversal of taxable temporary differences taxable in come in carryback and carryforward periods the availability of tax planning strategies the existence of appreciated assets estimates of future taxable income and other factors estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas reserves selling prices and other subjective operating assumptions that are consistent with internal business forecasts in evaluating potential sources of negative evidence we consider a cumulative loss in recent years any history of operating losse s or tax credit carryforwards expiring unused losses expected in early future years unsettled circumstances that if unfavorably resolved would adversely affect future operations and profit levels on a continuing basis in future years and carryback or carryforward periods that are so brief that it would limit realization of tax benefits if a significant deductible temporary difference is expected to reverse in a single year due to a sustained low commodity price environment we remained in a threeyea r cumulative consolidated loss position at december 31 2018 a threeyear cumulative consolidated loss constitutes objective negative evidence to which the accounting standards require we assign significant weight relative to subjective evidence such as our estimates of future taxable income we are generally not recognizing deferred tax benefit or expense in certain countries primarily the us denmark hydrocarbon tax only malaysia and guyana while we maintain valuation allowances against net def erred tax assets in these jurisdictions 

at december 31 2018 the consolidated balance sheet reflects a 4877 million valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets for multiple jurisdictions based on the evaluation of the accounting standards described above the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable however could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income change or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight is given to subjective evidence such as expected future growth 

asset retirement obligations we have material legal obligations to remove and dismantle long‑lived assets and to restore land or seabed at certain ep locations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we recognize a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations in addition the fair value of any legally required conditional asset retirement obligation is recorded if the liability can be reasonably estimated we capitalize such costs as a component of the carrying amount of the underlying assets in the period in which the liability is incurred in subsequent periods the liability is accreted and the asset is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset we estimate the fair value of these obligations by discounting projected future payments that will be required to satisfy the obligations in determining these estimates we are required to make several assumptions and judgments related to the scope of dismantlement timing of settlement interpretation of legal requirements inflationary factors and discount rate in addition there are other external factors which could significantly affect the ultimate settlement costs for these obligations including changes in environmental regulations and other statutory requirements fluctuations in industry costs and foreign currency exchange rates and advances in technology as a result our estimates of asset retirement obligations are subject to revision due to the factors described above changes in estimates prior to settlement result in adjustments to both the liability and related asset values unless the field has ceased production in which case changes are recognized in our consolidated statement of income  see note 9 asset retirement obligations  

retirement plans we have funded noncontributory defined benefit pension plans an unfunded supplemental pension plan and an unfunded postretirement medical plan we recognize the net change in the funded status of the projected benefit obligation for these plans in the consolidated balance sheet  

the determination of the obligations and expenses related to these plans are based on several actuarial assumptions these assumptions represent estimates made by us some of which can be affected by external factors the most significant assumptions relate to

discount rate used for measuring the present value of future plan obligations the discount rate used to estimate our projected benefit obligation is based on a portfolio of high‑quality fixed income debt instruments with maturities that approximate the expected payment of plan obligations at december 31 2018 a 025 decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase projected benefit obligations by approximately 100 million and forecasted 2019 annual benefit expense by approximately 5 million the increase in the projected benefit obligation would decrease the funded status of our pension plans but any decrease in the funded status would be partially mitigated by increases in the fair value of fixed income investments in the asset portfolio 

expected longterm rates of returns on plan assets the expected return on plan assets is developed from the expected future returns for each asset category weighted by the target allocation of pension assets to that asset category t he future expected return assumptions for individual asset categories are largely based on inputs from various investment experts regarding their future return expectations for particular asset categories at december 31 2018 a 025 decrease in the expected longterm rates of returns on plan assets assumption would increase forecasted 2019 annual benefit expense by approximately 5 million 

other assumptions include the rate of future increases in compensation levels and participant mortality level

 

 

derivatives we utilize derivative instruments including futures forwards options and swaps in dividually or in combination to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in the prices of crude oil and natural gas as well as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates all derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet  our policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative the changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized currently in earnings deriv atives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions cash flow hedges or hedges of changes in fair value of recognized assets and liabilities or of unrecognized firm commitments fair value hedges changes in fai r value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income loss amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the s ame period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings the change in fair value of the related hedged commitment is recorded as an adjustment t o its carrying amount and recognized currently in earnings 

fair value measurements we use various valuation approaches in determining fair value for financial instruments including the market and income approaches our fair value measurements also include nonperformance risk and time value of money considerations counterparty credit is considered for receivable balances and our credit is considered for accrued liabilities 

we also record certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value when required by generally accepted accounting principles these fair value measurements are recorded in connection with business combinations qualifying nonmonetary exchanges the initial recognition of asset retirement obligations and any impairment of longlived assets equity method investments or goodwill

we determine fair value in accordance with the fair value measurements accounting standard which established a hierarchy for the inputs used to measure fair value based on the source of the inputs which generally range from quoted prices for identical instruments in a principal trading market level 1 to estimates determined using related market data level 3 including discounted cash flows and other unobservable data  measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered level 2 when level 1 inputs are available within a particular market those inputs are selected for determination of fair value over level 2 or 3 inputs in the same market multiple inputs may be used to measure fair value however the level of fair value assigned for each physical derivative and financial asset or liability is based on the lowest significant input level within this fair value hierarchy 

environment health and safety

our longterm vision and values provide a foundation for how we do business and define our commitment to meeting high standards of corporate citizenship and creating a long lasting positive impact on the communities where we do business our strategy is reflected in our environment health safety and social responsibility ehs  sr policies and by a management system framework that helps protect our workforce customers and local communities our management systems are intended to promote internal consistency adherence to policy objectives and continual improvement in ehs  sr performance improved performance may in the short‑term increase our operating costs and could also require increased capital expenditures to reduce potential risks to our assets reputation and license to operate in addition to enhanced ehs  sr performance improved productivity and operational efficiencies may be realized from investments in ehs  sr we have programs in place to evaluate regulatory compliance audit facilities train employees prevent and manage risks and emergencies and to generally meet corporate ehs  sr goals and objectives

we recognize that climate change is a global environmental concern we assess monitor and take measures to reduce our carbon footprint at existing and planned operations we are committed to complying with all greenhouse gas ghg emissions mandates and the responsible management of ghg emissions at our facilities

we will have continuing expenditures for environmental assessment and remediation sites where corrective action may be necessary include onshore ep facilities sites from discontinued operations where we retained liability and although not currently significant “superfund” sites where we have been named a potentially responsible party

we accrue for environmental assessment and remediation expenses when the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable at december 31 2018 our reserve for estimated remediation liabilities was approximately 80 million we expect that existing reserves for environmental liabilities will adequately cover costs to assess and remediate known sites our remediation spending was approximately 15 million in 2018 2017 15 million 2016 10 million the amount of other expenditures incurred to comply with federal state local and foreign country environmental regulations is difficult to quantify as such costs are captured as mostly indistinguishable components of our capital expenditures and operating expenses 

 

 




 ite m 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of our business we are exposed to commodity risks related to changes in the prices of crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas as well as changes in interest rates and foreign currency values in the disclosures that follow financial risk management activities refer to the mitigation of these risks through hedging activities

controls we maintain a control environment under the direction of our chief risk officer controls over instruments used in financial risk management activities include volumetric and term limits our treasury department is responsible for administering and monitoring foreign exchange rate and interest rate hedging programs using similar controls and processes where applicable hedging strategies are reviewed annually by the audit committee of the board of directors 

instruments we primarily use forward commodity contracts foreign exchange forward contracts futures swaps and options in our risk management activities these contracts are generally widely traded instruments with standardized terms the following describes these instruments and how we use them 









financial risk management activities

at december 31 2018 outstanding total debt excluding capital leases was substantially comprised of fixed rate debt instruments with a carrying value of 6403 million and a fair value of 6225 million a 15 increase or decrease in interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately 480 million or 550 million respectively any changes in interest rates do not impact cash outflows associated with fixed rate interest payments or settlement of debt principal unless a debt instrument is repurchased prior to maturity 

at december 31 2018 we have outstanding wti crude oil put contracts for calendar year 2019 with a wti monthly floor price of 60 per barrel for 95000 bopd at december 31 2018 an assumed 10 increase in the forward wti crude oil prices used in determining the fair value of our crude oil put contracts would reduce the fair value of these derivatives instruments by approximately 120 million while an assumed 10 decrease in the same wti crude oil prices would increase the fair value of these derivative instruments by approximately 140 million 

we have outstanding foreign exchange contracts with a total notional amount of 16 million at december 31 2018 that are used to reduce our exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates for various currencies the change in fair value of foreign exchange contracts from a 10 weakening of the us dollar exchange rate is estimated to be a loss of less than 5 million at december 31 2018

proved reserves

proved reserves are calculated using the average price during the twelvemonth period ending december 31 determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the price on the first day of each month within the year unless prices are defined by contractual agreements and exclude escalations based on future conditions crude oil prices used in the determination of proved reserves at december 31 2017 were 5119 per barrel for wti 2016 4268 and 5487 per barrel for brent 2016 4445 our total proved developed and undeveloped reserves at december 31 were as follows







 

 

proved undeveloped reserves were 37 of our total proved reserves at december 31 2017 on a boe basis 2016 28 proved reserves he ld under production sharing contracts totaled 7 of our crude oil reserves and 44 of our natural gas reserves at december 31 2017 2016 4 and 45 respectively

ep operations

at december 31 2017 our significant ep assets include the following

united states 

our production in the us was from onshore properties principally in the bakken oil shale play in the williston basin of north dakota bakken and the utica basin of ohio and from offshore properties in the gulf of mexico

onshore

bakken at december 31 2017 we held approximately 554000 net acres in the bakken with varying working interest percentages during 2017 we operated an average of 35 rigs drilled 85 wells completed 68 wells and brought 68 wells on production bringing the total operated production wells to 1315 by yearend drilling and completion costs per operated well averaged 56 million in 2017 based on a change in our standard well design during the year to a 60stage completion with proppant loadings of 140000 pounds per stage compared to an average well cost of 48 million in 2016 using a 50stage completion with proppant loadings of 70000 pounds per stage during 2018 we plan to increase our rig count in the second half of the year to six rigs from four rigs to drill approximately 120 wells and bring approximately 95 wells on production in addition our capital budget for 2018 will fund pad construction in preparation for 2019 drilling we forecast net production for full year 2018 to be in the range of 115000 boepd to 120000 boepd compared to production of 105000 boepd in 2017 

utica we own a 50 working interest in approximately 37000 net acres in the wet gas area of the utica basin of ohio there was no drilling activity in the utica in 2017 in 2018 we expect to complete and bring on production five previously drilled wells 

offshore at december 31 2017 we held interests in 73 blocks in the deepwater gulf of mexico our production offshore in the gulf of mexico was principally from the baldpate hess 50 conger hess 38 hack wilson hess 25 llano hess 50 penn state hess 50 shenzi hess 28 and tubular bells hess 57 fields in addition we are operator of the stampede development project hess 25 at december 31 2017 we held approximately 210000 net undeveloped acres of which leases covering approximately 55000 acres are due to expire in the next three years 

 

 

 

significant events relating to operations in the gulf of mexico during 2017 were as follows 

producing assets production from the baldpate conger llano and penn state fields were shutin following a fire at the thirdparty operated enchilada platform in november 2017 prior to the shutdown net production from these assets was approximately 30000 boepd production at the baldpate field restarted in midfebruary and is expected to restart at the penn state field in the first quarter at the llano field in the second quarter and at the conger field in the third quarter of 2018 

penn state at this hess operated field we drilled one production well that was completed in november 2017 

stampede at this hess operated project in the green canyon area of the gulf of mexico in 2017 we completed installation of the tension leg platform and subsea equipment finished drilling and completing three production wells and received regulatory approval for production operations at the end of the year in january 2018 we commenced production from the field which is expected to ramp up over the next 18 months as we continue a drilling program of three additional production wells and four water injection wells 

europe

denmark in 2017 we announced that we plan to commence a process to sell our interest in the hess operated offshore south arne field hess 62 in 2018 total proved reserves for denmark were 64 million boe at december 31 2017 

africa

ghana at the hess operated offshore deepwater tanocape three points license hess 50 license interest management determined in the fourth quarter of 2017 that it would not develop the previously discovered fields  as a result we recorded a charge of 280 million to writeoff previously capitalized exploration wells and other lease costs see capitalized exploratory well costs in note 5 property plant and equipment and note 24 subsequent events in the notes to consolidated financial statements  

libya at the onshore waha concession in libya which includes the defa faregh gialo north gialo and belhedan fields hess 8 production was shutin by the operator for extended periods in 2016 and 2015 due to force majeure caused by civil unrest the national oil company of libya lifted force majeure in september 2016 and production recommenced in october 2016 net production averaged approximately 10000 boepd in 2017 1000 boepd in 2016 and zero in 2015 

asia and other

malaysiathailand joint development area jda  at the carigali hess operated offshore block a18 in the gulf of thailand  hess 50  no drilling is planned for 2018 as contracted volumes are expected to be met as a result of the booster compression project that came online in 2016 

malaysia our production in malaysia comes from our interest in block pm301 hess 50 which is adjacent to and is unitized with block a‑18 of the jda and our 50 interest in blocks pm302 pm325 and pm326b located in the north malay basin nmb offshore peninsular malaysia where we operate a multi‑phase natural gas development project in july 2017 production of natural gas commenced from the fullfield development and net production for 2017 averaged 66 mmcfd with the planned plateau rate of 165 mmcfd being achieved in the fourth quarter in 2018 we plan to drill three production wells and progress development activities related to future phases 

guyana at the esso exploration and production guyana limited operated offshore stabroek block hess 30 participating interest the partners sanctioned the first phase of the liza field development in 2017 this phase is expected to have a gross capital cost of approximately 32 billion for drilling and subsea infrastructure of which we expect to incur 250 million net in 2018 with first production expected in march 2020 the development plan includes a leased floating production storage and offloading fpso vessel that will have the capacity to process up to 120000 barrels of oil per day from 17 wells including eight producers six water injectors and three gas injectors at december 31 2017 we have proved reserves of 45 million boe related to liza phase 1 

an application for an environmental permit to develop the second phase at liza has been submitted the concept for phase 2 involves the use of a larger fpso vessel and subsea systems that would have a production capacity of approximately 220000 bopd with first production expected by mid2022 planning is also underway for a third phase of development with an fpso vessel at the payara field with first production planned for 2023 or 2024 the size of the third ship will depend upon the results of future exploration and appraisal drilling 

 

 

 

in 2017 the following wells were completed on the stabroek block in chronological order 

payara1 the well located approximately 10 miles northwest of the liza discovery encountered 95 feet of highquality oil bearing sandstone reservoirs 

snoek1  the well encountered more than 82 feet of highquality oilbearing sandstone reservoirs and is located approximately 5 miles southeast of the liza1 oil discovery 

liza4 the well encountered more than 197 feet of highquality oilbearing sandstone reservoirs 

payara2  the well encountered 59 feet of highquality oilbearing sandstone reservoirs and confirmed a second large oil field in addition to the liza field the well is located approximately 12 miles northwest from the liza phase 1 project 

turbot1 the well encountered a reservoir of 75 feet of highquality oilbearing sandstone in the primary objective the well is located approximately 30 miles to the southeast of the liza phase 1 project 

in january 2018 the operator announced a sixth oil discovery at the ranger prospect the ranger1 well encountered approximately 230 feet of highquality oilbearing carbonate reservoir and is located approximately 60 miles to the northwest of the liza field in 2018 additional drilling is planned including appraisal of the liza turbot and ranger discoveries as well as a wider exploration program that will target additional prospects and play types on the block drilling of the pacora prospect commenced in january 

suriname  we hold a 33 nonoperated participating interest in t he block 42 contract area offshore suriname the operator kosmos energy ltd completed a 6500square kilometer 3d seismic shoot in 2017 and expects to drill its first exploration well in 2018 in 2017 we entered into a 33 nonoperated participating interest in the block 59 contract area offshore suriname where the operator exxonmobil exploration and production suriname bv is planning a seismic program in 2018 

canada we hold a 50 participating interest in four exploration licenses offshore nova scotia in 2018 the operator bp canada plans to drill its first exploration well in addition in 2017 we were granted a 25 participating interest in three bp canada operated exploration licenses offshore newfoundland 

sales commitments

we have certain longterm contracts with fixed minimum sales volume commitments for natural gas and natural gas liquids production at the jda in the gulf of thailand we have annual minimum net sales commitments of approximately 85 billion cubic feet of natural gas per year through 2025 and approximately 40 billion cubic feet per year in 2026 and 2027 at the north malay basin development project offshore malaysia we have annual net sales commitments of approximately 55 billion cubic feet per year through 2024 our estimated total volume of production subject to these sales commitments is approximately 12 trillion cubic feet of natural gas we also have natural gas liquids minimum delivery commitments primarily in the bakken through 2023 of approximately 10 million barrels per year or approximately 60 million barrels over the remaining life of the contracts

we have not experienced any significant constraints in satisfying the committed quantities required by our sales commitments and we anticipate being able to meet future requirements from available proved and probable reserves and projected thirdparty supply

midstream 

the midstream operating segment provides feebased services including gathering compressing and processing natural gas and fractionating natural gas liquids ngls gathering terminaling loading and transporting crude oil and ngls and storing and terminaling propane primarily in the bakken and three forks shale plays in the williston basin area of north dakota

in july 2015 we sold a 50 interest in hess infrastructure partners lp hip to global infrastructure partners gip for net cash consideration of approximately 26 billion in april 2017 hess midstream partners lp the “partnership” sold 16997000 common units representing limited partner interests at a price of 23 per unit in an initial public offering ipo for net proceeds of 3655 million of which 350 million was distributed equally to hess corporation and gip 

at december 31 2017 hess corporation and gip each owned a direct 3375 limited partner interest in the partnership and a 50 indirect ownership interest through hip in the partnership’s general partner which has a 2 economic interest in the partnership plus incentive distribution rights the public unit holders own a 305 limited partner interest in the partnership in turn the partnership owns an approximate 20 controlling interest in the operating companies that comprise our midstream joint venture while hip the 5050 joint venture between hess corporation and gip owns the remaining 80 

the partnership and hip and its affiliates primarily comprise the midstream operating segment which currently generates substantially all of its revenues under longterm feebased agreements with our ep operating segment but intends to pursue additional throughput volumes from thirdparties in the williston basin area we operate the midstream assets under various operational and administrative services agreements beginning january 1 2017 the midstream segment included our interest in a permian gas plant in west texas and related co 2 assets and water handling assets in north dakota as a result of organizational changes to the management of those assets in the third quarter of 2017 we completed the sale of our assets in the permian basin including the gas plant in west texas and related co 2 assets the water assets are whollyowned by the corporation and are not included in our hip joint venture 

at december 31 2017 midstream assets include the following

















 

 

 

in 2018 the partnership announced the formation of a 5050 joint venture with targa resources corp to construct a new 200 mmcfd gas processing plant south of the missouri river i n mckenzie county north dakota which is expected to be completed in the second half of 2018 the plant is expected to increase the midstream segment’s total processing capacity in the bakken to 350 mmcfd as part of this project hip will construct new pipeline infrastructure to gather volumes for the new plant the expected combined project costs attributable to our midstream segment is 175 million

emergency preparedness and response plans and procedures

we have in place a series of business and assetspecific emergency preparedness response and business continuity plans that detail procedures for rapid and effective emergency response and environmental mitigation activities these plans are risk appropriate and are maintained reviewed and updated as necessary to confirm their accuracy and suitability where appropriate they are also reviewed and approved by the relevant host government authorities

responder training and drills are routinely held worldwide to assess and continually improve the effectiveness of our plans our contractors service providers representatives from government agencies and where applicable joint venture partners participate in the drills to help ensure that emergency procedures are comprehensive and can be effectively implemented

to complement internal capabilities and to help ensure coverage for our global operations we maintain membership contracts with a network of local regional and global oil spill response and emergency response organizations at the regional and global level these organizations include clean gulf associates cga marine spill response corporation msrc marine well containment company mwcc wild well control wwc subsea well intervention service swis and oil spill response limited osrl cga and msrc are domestic spill response organizations and mwcc provides the equipment and personnel to contain underwater well control incidents in the gulf of mexico wwc provides firefighting well control and engineering services globally osrl is a global response organization and is available when needed to assist us anywhere in the world in addition to owning response assets in their own right the organization maintains business relationships that provide immediate access to additional critical response support services if required these owned response assets include nearly 300 recovery and storage vessels and barges more than 250 skimmers over 600000 feet of boom 9 capping stacks and significant quantities of dispersants and other ancillary equipment including aircraft in addition to external well control and oil spill response support we have contracts with wildlife environmental meteorology incident management medical and security resources if we were to engage these organizations to obtain additional critical response support services we would fund such services and seek reimbursement under our insurance coverage as described below in certain circumstances we pursue and enter into mutual aid agreements with other companies and government cooperatives to receive and provide oil spill response equipment and personnel support we maintain close associations with emergency response organizations through our representation on the executive committees of cga and msrc as well as the board of directors of osrl

we continue to participate in a number of industrywide task forces that are studying better ways to assess the risk of and prevent onshore and offshore incidents access and control blowouts in subsea environments and improve containment and recovery methods the task forces are working closely with the oil and gas industry and international government agencies to implement improvements and increase the effectiveness of oil spill prevention preparedness response and recovery processes

insurance coverage and indemnification

we maintain insurance coverage that includes coverage for physical damage to our property thirdparty liability workers’ compensation and employers’ liability general liability sudden and accidental pollution and other coverage this insurance coverage is subject to deductibles exclusions and limitations and there is no assurance that such coverage will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences and damages 

the amount of insurance covering physical damage to our property and liability related to negative environmental effects resulting from a sudden and accidental pollution event excluding atlantic named windstorm coverage for which we are self‑insured varies by asset based on the assets estimated replacement value or the estimated maximum loss in the case of a catastrophic event first party coverage consists of two tiers of insurance the first 400 million of coverage is provided through an industry mutual insurance group above this 400 million threshold insurance is carried which ranges in value 

 

 

 

up to 111 billion in total depending on the asset coverage level as described above the insurance programs covering physical damage to our property exclude business interruption protection for our ep operations additionally we carry insurance that provides thirdparty coverage for general liability and sudden and accidental pollution up to 108 billion which coverage under a standard joint operating arrangement would be reduced to our participating interest 

our insurance policies renew at various dates each year future insurance coverage could increase in cost and may include higher deductibles or retentions or additional exclusions or limitations in addition some forms of insurance may become unavailable in the future or unavailable on terms that are deemed economically acceptable

generally our drilling contracts and most of our other offshore services contracts provide for a mutual hold harmless indemnity structure whereby each party to the contract the corporation and contractor indemnifies the other party for injuries or damages to their personnel and property and often those of its contractorssubcontractors regardless of fault variations may include indemnity exclusions to the extent a claim is attributable to the gross negligence andor willful misconduct of a party third‑party claims on the other hand are generally allocated on a fault basis

we are customarily responsible for and indemnify the contractor against all claims including those from third‑parties to the extent attributable to pollution or contamination by substances originating from our reservoirs or other property and the contractor is responsible for and indemnifies us for all claims attributable to pollution emanating from the contractor’s property variations may include indemnity exclusions to the extent a claim is attributable to the gross negligence andor willful misconduct of a party additionally we are generally liable for all of our own losses and most third‑party claims associated with catastrophic losses such as damage to reservoirs blowouts cratering and loss of hole regardless of cause although exceptions for losses attributable to gross negligence andor willful misconduct do exist lastly some offshore services contracts include overall limitations of the contractor’s liability equal to a fixed negotiated amount variations may include exclusions of all contractual indemnities from the liability cap

under a standard joint operating agreement joa each party is liable for all claims arising under the joa to the extent of its participating interest operator or nonoperator variations include indemnity exclusions when the claim is based upon the gross negligence andor willful misconduct of the operator in which case the operator is solely liable the parties to the joa may continue to be jointly and severally liable for claims made by thirdparties in some jurisdictions further under some production sharing contracts between a governmental entity and commercial parties liability of the commercial parties to the government entity is joint and several

environmental

compliance with various existing environmental and pollution control regulations imposed by federal state local and foreign governments is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations but increasingly stringent environmental regulations have resulted and will likely continue to result in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us and the oil and gas industry in general we spent approximately 15 million in 2017 for environmental remediation the level of other expenditures to comply with federal state local and foreign country environmental regulations is difficult to quantify as such costs are captured as mostly indistinguishable components of our capital expenditures and operating expenses for further discussion of environmental matters see environment health and safety in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

number of employees

at december 31 2017 we had 2075 employees in january 2018 we eliminated approximately 300 of these positions see note 24 subsequent events in notes to consolidated financial statements

 ite m 1a risk factors 

our business activities and the value of our securities are subject to significant risks including the risk factors described below these risk factors could negatively affect our operations financial condition liquidity and results of operations and as a result holders and purchasers of our securities could lose part or all of their investments it is possible that additional risks relating to our securities may be described in a prospectus supplement if we issue securities in the future

our business and operating results are highly dependent on the market prices of crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas which can be very volatile our estimated proved reserves revenue operating cash flows operating margins liquidity financial condition and future earnings are highly dependent on the benchmark market prices of crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas and our associated realized price differentials which are volatile and influenced by numerous factors beyond our control the major foreign oil producing countries including members of opec may exert considerable influence over the supply and price of crude oil and refined petroleum products their ability or inability to agree on a common policy on rates of production and other matters may have a significant impact on the oil markets other factors include but are not limited to worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas political conditions and events including instability changes in governments or armed conflict around the world and in particular in crude oil or natural gas producing regions the cost of exploring for developing and producing crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas the price and availability of alternative fuels or other forms of energy the effect of energy conservation and environmental protection efforts and overall economic conditions globally the sentiment of commodities trading markets as well as other supply and demand factors may also influence the selling prices of crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas average prices for 2017 were 5085 per barrel for wti 2016 4347 2015 4876 and 5474 per barrel for brent 2016 4513 2015 5360 in order to manage the potential volatility of cash flows and credit requirements we maintain significant bank credit facilities an inability to access renew or replace such credit facilities or access other sources of funding as they mature would negatively impact our liquidity 

if we fail to successfully increase our reserves our future crude oil and natural gas production will be adversely impacted we own or have access to a finite amount of oil and gas reserves which will be depleted over time replacement of oil and gas production and reserves including proved undeveloped reserves is subject to successful exploration drilling development activities and enhanced recovery programs therefore future oil and gas production is dependent on technical success in finding and developing additional hydrocarbon reserves exploration activity involves the interpretation of seismic and other geological and geophysical data which does not always successfully predict the presence of commercial quantities of hydrocarbons drilling risks include unexpected adverse conditions irregularities in pressure or formations equipment failure blowouts and weather interruptions future developments may be affected by unforeseen reservoir conditions which negatively affect recovery factors or flow rates reserve replacement can also be achieved through acquisition similar risks however may be encountered in the production of oil and gas on properties acquired from others in addition to the technical risks to reserve replacement replacing reserves and developing future production is also influenced by the price of crude oil and natural gas and costs of drilling and development activities lower crude oil and natural gas prices may have the effect of reducing capital available for exploration and development activity and may render certain development projects uneconomic or delay their completion and may result in negative revisions to existing reserves while increasing drilling and development costs could negatively affect expected economic returns 

there are inherent uncertainties in estimating quantities of proved reserves and discounted future net cash flows and actual quantities may be lower than estimated numerous uncertainties exist in estimating quantities of proved reserves and future net revenues from those reserves actual future production oil and gas prices revenues taxes capital expenditures operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates and could materially affect the estimated quantities of our proved reserves and the related future net revenues in addition reserve estimates may be subject to downward or upward changes based on production performance purchases or sales of properties results of future development prevailing oil and gas prices production sharing contracts which may decrease reserves as crude oil and natural gas prices increase and other factors crude oil prices declined significantly in 2015 and to a lesser extent in 2016 relative to preceding years resulting in reductions to our reported proved reserves in contrast crude oil prices improved somewhat in 2017 resulting in increases to our reported proved reserves if crude oil prices in 2018 average below prices used to determine proved reserves at december 31 2017 it could have an adverse effect on our estimates of proved reserve volumes and on the value of our business see crude oil and natural gas reserves in critical accounting policies and estimates in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

we do not always control decisions made under joint operating agreements and the parties under such agreements may fail to meet their obligations we conduct many of our ep operations through joint operating agreements with other parties under which we may not control decisions either because we do not have a controlling interest or are not operator under the agreement there is risk that these parties may at any time have economic business or legal interests or goals that 

 

 

 

are inconsistent with ours and therefore decisions may be made which are n ot what we believe is in our best interest moreover parties to these agreements may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone in either case the value of our investment may be adve rsely affected 

we are subject to changing laws and regulations and other governmental actions that can significantly and adversely affect our business federal state local territorial and foreign laws and regulations relating to tax increases and retroactive tax claims disallowance of tax credits and deductions expropriation or nationalization of property mandatory government participation cancellation or amendment of contract rights imposition of capital controls or blocking of funds changes in import and export regulations limitations on access to exploration and development opportunities antibribery or anticorruption laws as well as other political developments may affect our operations 

we have substantial capital requirements and we may not be able to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms if at all the exploration development and production of crude oil and natural gas involves substantial costs which may not be fully funded from operations for example in 2017 we had a significant net loss and unless commodity prices are considerably higher through 2018 we are forecasting a net loss for 2018 two of the three major credit rating agencies that rate our debt have assigned an investment grade rating although currently we do not have any borrowings under our longterm credit facility a ratings downgrade continued weakness in the oil and gas industry or negative outcomes within commodity and financial markets could adversely impact our access to capital markets by increasing the costs of financing or by impacting our ability to obtain financing on satisfactory terms or at all in addition a ratings downgrade may require that we issue letters of credit or provide other forms of collateral under certain contractual requirements any inability to access capital markets could adversely impact our financial adaptability and our ability to execute our strategy and may also expose us to heightened exposure to credit risk 

political instability in areas where we operate can adversely affect our business some of the international areas in which we operate and the partners with whom we operate are politically less stable than other areas and partners and may be subject to civil unrest conflict insurgency geographic territorial border disputes corruption security risks and labor unrest political and civil unrest in north africa and the middle east has affected and may affect our operations in these areas as well as oil and gas markets generally the threat of terrorism around the world also poses additional risks to the operations of the oil and gas industry 

our oil and gas operations are subject to environmental risks and environmental laws and regulations that can result in significant costs and liabilities our oil and gas operations like those of the industry are subject to environmental risks such as oil spills produced water spills gas leaks and ruptures and discharges of substances or gases that could expose us to substantial liability for pollution or other environmental damage our operations are also subject to numerous us federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations non‑compliance with these laws and regulations may subject us to administrative civil or criminal penalties remedial cleanups and natural resource damages or other liabilities in addition increasingly stringent environmental regulations have resulted and will likely continue to result in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us and the oil and gas industry in general similarly we have material legal obligations to dismantle remove and abandon production facilities and wells that will occur many years in the future in most cases these estimates may be impacted by future changes in regulations and other uncertainties 

concerns have been raised in certain jurisdictions where we have operations concerning the safety and environmental impact of the drilling and development of shale oil and gas resources particularly hydraulic fracturing water usage flaring of associated natural gas and air emissions while we believe that these operations can be conducted safely and with minimal impact on the environment regulatory bodies are responding to these concerns and may impose moratoriums and new regulations on such drilling operations that would likely have the effect of prohibiting or delaying such operations and increasing their cost

climate change initiatives may result in significant operational changes and expenditures reduced demand for our products and adversely affect our business we recognize that climate change is a global environmental concern continuing political and social attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national regional or local legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions these agreements and measures may require or could result in future legislation and regulatory measures that require significant equipment modifications operational changes taxes or purchase of emission credits to reduce emission of greenhouse gases from our operations which may result in substantial capital expenditures and compliance operating maintenance and remediation costs in addition our production is sold to third parties that produce petroleum fuels which through normal end user consumption result in the emission of greenhouse gases regulatory initiatives to reduce the use of these fuels may reduce demand for crude oil and other hydrocarbons and have an adverse effect on our sales volumes revenues and margins the imposition and enforcement of stringent greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets could severely and adversely impact the oil and gas industry and significantly reduce the value of our business furthermore increasing attention to climate change risks has resulted in increased likelihood of governmental investigations and private litigation which could increase 

 

 

 

our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business for example in 2017 certain municipalities in california separately filed lawsuits against over 30 fossil fuel producers including us for alleged damages purportedly caused by climate change 

our industry is highly competitive and many of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than we have   the petroleum industry is highly competitive and very capital intensive we encounter competition from numerous companies in each of our activities including acquiring rights to explore for crude oil and natural gas to a lesser extent we are also in competition with producers of alternative fuels or other forms of energy including wind solar and electric power and in the future could face increasing competition due to the development and adoption of new technologies many competitors including national oil companies are larger and have substantially greater resources increased competition for worldwide oil and gas assets could significantly increase the cost of acquiring oil and gas assets in addition competition for drilling services technical expertise and equipment may affect the availability of technical personnel and drilling rigs resulting in increased capital and operating costs 

catastrophic events whether naturally occurring or man‑made may materially affect our operations and financial conditions our oil and gas operations are subject to unforeseen occurrences which have affected us from time to time and which may damage or destroy assets interrupt operations and have other significant adverse effects examples of catastrophic risks include hurricanes fires explosions blowouts pipeline interruptions and ruptures severe weather geological events labor disputes or cyber‑attacks we maintain insurance coverage against many but not all potential losses and liabilities in amounts we deem prudent including for property and casualty losses there can be no assurance that such insurance will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences and damages moreover some forms of insurance may be unavailable in the future or be available only on terms that are deemed economically unacceptable 

significant time delays between the estimated and actual occurrence of critical events associated with development projects may result in material negative economic consequences as part of our business we are involved in large development projects the completion of which may be delayed beyond what was originally planned such examples include but are not limited to delays in receiving necessary approvals from project members or regulatory agencies timely access to necessary equipment availability of necessary personnel construction delays unfavorable weather conditions and equipment failures this may lead to delays and differences between estimated and actual timing of critical events these delays could impact our future results of operations and cash flows 

departures of key members from our senior management team andor difficulty in recruiting and retaining adequate numbers of experienced technical personnel could negatively impact our ability to deliver on our strategic goals our future success depends upon the continued service of key members of our senior management team who play an important role in developing and implementing our strategy the departure of key members of senior management or an inability to recruit and retain adequate numbers of experienced technical and professional personnel in the necessary locations may prevent us from executing our strategy in full or in part which could negatively impact our business 

we are dependent on oilfield service companies for items including drilling rigs equipment supplies and skilled labor an inability or significant delay in securing these services or a high cost thereof may result in material negative economic consequences the availability and cost of drilling rigs equipment supplies and skilled labor will fluctuate over time given the cyclical nature of the ep industry as a result we may encounter difficulties in obtaining required services or could face an increase in cost these consequences may impact our ability to run our operations and to deliver projects on time with the potential for material negative economic consequences 

we manage commodity price and other risks through our risk management function but such activities may impede our ability to benefit from commodity price increases and can expose us to similar potential counterparty credit risk as impacts amounts due from the sale of hydrocarbons we may enter into additional commodity price hedging arrangements to protect us from commodity price declines these arrangements may depending on the instruments used and the level of increases involved limit any potential upside from commodity price increases as with accounts receivable we may be exposed to potential economic loss should a counterparty be unable or unwilling to perform their obligations under the terms of a hedging agreement in addition we are exposed to risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency values and may engage in hedging activities to mitigate related volatility 

one of our subsidiaries is the general partner of a publicly traded master limited partnership hess midstream partners lp the responsibilities associated with being a general partner expose the us to a broader range of legal liabilities  our control of hess midstream partners lp bestows upon us additional fiduciary duties including but not limited to the obligations associated with managing potential conflicts of interests additional reporting requirements from the securities and exchange commission and the provision of tax information to unit holders of hess midstream partners lp these heightened duties expose us to additional potential for legal claims that may have a material negative economic impact on our shareholders moreover these increased duties may lead to an increase in compliance costs and may divert management resource from our other operations

 item 1b unresolved staff comments

none







 item 3 legal proceedings

we along with many companies that have been or continue to be engaged in refining and marketing of gasoline have been a party to lawsuits and claims related to the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe in gasoline a series of similar lawsuits many involving water utilities or governmental entities were filed in jurisdictions across the us against producers of mtbe and petroleum refiners who produced gasoline containing mtbe including us the principal allegation in all cases was that gasoline containing mtbe is a defective product and that these parties are strictly liable in proportion to their share of the gasoline market for damage to groundwater resources and are required to take remedial action to ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of releases of mtbe the majority of the cases asserted against us have been settled there are four remaining active cases filed by pennsylvania vermont rhode island and maryland in june 2014 the commonwealth of pennsylvania and the state of vermont each filed independent lawsuits alleging that we and all major oil companies with operations in each respective state have damaged the groundwater in those states by introducing thereto gasoline with mtbe the pennsylvania suit has been removed to federal court and has been forwarded to the existing mtbe multidistrict litigation pending in the southern district of new york the suit filed in vermont is proceeding there in a state court in september 2016 the state of rhode island also filed a lawsuit alleging that we and other major oil companies damaged the groundwater in rhode island by introducing thereto gasoline with mtbe the suit filed in rhode island is proceeding in federal court in december 2017 the state of maryland filed a lawsuit alleging that we and other major oil companies damaged the groundwater in maryland by introducing thereto gasoline with mtbe the suit filed in maryland was filed in state court but has not been served to date

in september 2003 we received a directive from the new jersey department of environmental protection njdep to remediate contamination in the sediments of the lower passaic river the njdep is also seeking natural resource damages the directive insofar as it affects us relates to alleged releases from a petroleum bulk storage terminal in newark new jersey we previously owned we and over 70 companies entered into an administrative order on consent with the environmental protection agency epa to study the same contamination this work remains ongoing we and other parties settled a cost recovery claim by the state of new jersey and also agreed with epa to fund remediation of a portion of the site on march 4 2016 the epa issued a record of decision rod in respect of the lower eight miles of the lower passaic river selecting a remedy that includes banktobank dredging at an estimated cost of 138 billion the rod does not address the upper nine miles of the lower passaic river or the newark bay which may require additional remedial action in addition the federal trustees for natural resources have begun a separate assessment of damages to natural resources in the passaic river given that the epa has not selected a remedy for the entirety of the lower passaic river or the newark bay total remedial costs cannot be reliably estimated at this time based on currently known facts and circumstances we do not 

 

 

 

believe that this matter will result in a significant liability to us because there are numerous other parties who we expect will share in the cost of remediation and damages and our former terminal did not store or use contaminants which are of the greatest concern in the river sediments and could not have contributed contamination along most of the river’s length 

in march 2014 we received an administrative order from epa requiring us and 26 other parties to undertake the remedial design for the remedy selected by the epa for the gowanus canal superfund site in brooklyn new york the remedy includes dredging of surface sediments and the placement of a cap over the deeper sediments throughout the canal and insitu stabilization of certain contaminated sediments that will remain in place below the cap epa has estimated that this remedy will cost 506 million however the ultimate costs that will be incurred in connection with the design and implementation of the remedy remain uncertain our alleged liability derives from our former ownership and operation of a fuel oil terminal and connected shipbuilding and repair facility adjacent to the canal we indicated to epa that we would comply with the administrative order and are currently contributing funding for the remedial design based on an interim allocation of costs among the parties at the same time we are participating in an allocation process whereby a neutral expert selected by the parties will determine the final shares of the remedial design costs to be paid by each of the participants 

on september 28 2017 we received a general notice letter and offer to settle from the us environmental protection agency relating to superfund claims for the ector drum inc superfund site in odessa tx the epa and texas commission on environmental quality tceq took cleanup and response action at the site commencing in 2014 and concluded in december 2015 the site was determined to have improperly stored industrial waste including drums with oily liquids the total cleanup cost incurred by the epa was approximately 35 million we were invited to negotiate a voluntary settlement for our purported share of the cleanup costs our share if any is undetermined 

we periodically receive notices from the epa that we are a “potential responsible party” under the superfund legislation with respect to various waste disposal sites under this legislation all potentially responsible parties may be jointly and severally liable for certain sites such as those discussed above the epa’s claims or assertions of liability against us relating to these sites have not been fully developed with respect to the remaining sites the epa’s claims have been settled or a proposed settlement is under consideration in all cases for amounts that are not material the ultimate impact of these proceedings and of any related proceedings by private parties on our business or accounts cannot be predicted at this time due to the large number of other potentially responsible parties and the speculative nature of cleanup cost estimates but is not expected to be material

from time to time we are involved in other judicial and administrative proceedings including proceedings relating to other environmental matters we cannot predict with certainty if how or when such proceedings will be resolved or what the eventual relief if any may be particularly for proceedings that are in their early stages of development or where plaintiffs seek indeterminate damages numerous issues may need to be resolved including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters before a loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated for any proceeding

subject to the foregoing in management’s opinion based upon currently known facts and circumstances the outcome of the aforementioned proceedings are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

 i tem 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

hess corporation incorporated in the state of delaware in 1920 is a global exploration and production ep company engaged in exploration development production transportation purchase and sale of crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas with production operations located primarily in the united states us denmark the malaysiathailand joint development area jda and malaysia the corporation conducts exploration activities primarily offshore guyana suriname canada and in the gulf of mexico including at the stabroek block offshore guyana where we have participated in six significant crude oil discoveries and sanctioned the first phase of a multiphase development project at the liza field during 2017 we sold our interests in equatorial guinea norway and our enhanced oil recovery assets in the permian basin onshore us the 2017 asset sales of higher cost mature assets will provide funds toward our future development projects in the stabroek block offshore guyana in the fourth quarter of 2017 we announced that we would commence a process to sell our interests in denmark in 2018 these actions reflect the execution of our strategy to grow our resource base in a capital disciplined manner and to be cash generative at a 50 per barrel brent oil price post 2020 

the corporation’s midstream operating segment provides feebased services including gathering compressing and processing natural gas and fractionating natural gas liquids ngls gathering terminaling loading and transporting crude oil and ngls and storing and terminaling propane primarily in the bakken and three forks shale plays in the williston basin area of north dakota beginning january 1 2017 hess’ midstream segment included our interest in a permian gas plant in west texas and related co 2 assets and water handling assets in north dakota as a result of organizational changes to the management of those assets prior period information has been recast to conform to the current period presentation see note 22 segment information in the notes to consolidated financial statements  in the third quarter of 2017 we completed the sale of our midstream assets in the permian basin see note 2   dispositions in the notes to consolidated financial statements  

outlook

the corporation and its partners have discovered significant crude oil and natural gas resources on the stabroek block offshore guyana which will require substantial capital and time to fully develop as a result of these discovered fields which are expected to have a lower development cost than other assets in our portfolio we have changed the priorities of our future investment plans and have divested of higher cost mature assets to provide funds toward future development of guyana in addition we have announced plans to reduce debt and repurchase common stock

we project our ep capital and exploratory expenditures will be approximately 21 billion in 2018 up from 20 billion in 2017 reflecting increased activity at the liza field development project and a higher rig count in the bakken partially offset by lower spend at the stampede field and north malay basin development projects capital expenditures including equity investments for our midstream operations are expected to be approximately 330 million oil and gas production in 2018 is forecast to be in the range of 245000 boepd to 255000 boepd excluding any contribution from libya and reflecting an estimated 15000 boepd reduction due to the extended enchilada platform shutdown up from 242000 boepd in 2017 excluding libya and assets sold

net cash provided by operating activities was 945 million in 2017 compared to 795 million in 2016 while capital expenditures for 2017 and 2016 were 1973 million and 1921 million respectively based on current forward strip crude oil prices we forecast a net operating cash flow deficit including capital expenditures in 2018 the corporation expects to fund its 2018 net operating cash flow deficit including capital expenditures reduce debt by 500 million and repurchase 380 million of common stock with existing cash and cash equivalents which was 45 billion at december 31 2017 excluding midstream 

consolidated results

net loss attributable to hess corporation was 4074 million in 2017 2016 6132 million 2015 3056 million excluding items affecting comparability summarized on page 26 the adjusted net loss was 1401 million in 2017 2016 1489 million 2015 1113 million annual production averaged 306000 boepd in 2017 2016 322000 boepd 2015 375000 boepd total proved reserves were 1154 million boe at december 31 2017 2016 1109 million boe 2015 1086 million boe 

 

 

significant 2017 activities 

the following is an update of significant ep activities during 2017

producing ep assets





at the hess operated stampede development project in the green canyon area of the gulf of mexico in 2017 we completed installation of the tension leg platform and subsea equipment finished drilling and completing three production wells and received regulatory approval for production operations at the end of the year in january 2018 we commenced production from the field which is expected to ramp up over the next 18 months as we continue a drilling program of three additional production wells and four water injection wells











other ep assets



an application for an environmental permit to develop the second phase at liza has been submitted the concept for phase 2 involves the use of a larger fpso vessel and subsea systems that would have a production 

 

 

capacity of approximately 220000 bopd with first production expected by mid2022 planning is also underway for a third phase of development with an fpso vessel at the payara field with first production planned for 2023 or 2024 the size of the third ship will depend upon the results of future exploration and appraisal drilling 

in 2017 the following wells were drilled on the stabroek block in chronological order

payara1 the well located approximately 10 miles northwest of the liza discovery encountered 95 feet of highquality oil bearing sandstone reservoirs 

snoek1  the well encountered more than 82 feet of highquality oilbearing sandstone reservoirs and is located approximately 5 miles southeast of the liza1 oil discovery 

liza4 the well encountered more than 197 feet of highquality oilbearing sandstone reservoirs 

payara2  the well encountered 59 feet of highquality oilbearing sandstone reservoirs and confirmed a second large oil field in addition to the liza field the well is located approximately 12 miles northwest from the liza phase 1 project 

turbot1 the well encountered a reservoir of 75 feet of highquality oilbearing sandstone in the primary objective the well is located approximately 30 miles to the southeast of the liza phase 1 project 

in january 2018 the operator announced a sixth oil discovery at the ranger prospect the ranger1 well encountered approximately 230 feet of highquality oilbearing carbonate reservoir and is located approximately 60 miles to the northwest of the liza field in 2018 additional drilling is planned including appraisal of the liza turbot and ranger discoveries as well as a wider exploration program that will target additional prospects and play types on the block drilling of the pacora prospect commenced in january 



the following is an update of significant midstream activities during 2017





during 2017 the midstream segment brought online key strategic projects including safe and successful startup of the hawkeye gas facility the hawkeye oil facility and the johnson’s corner header system these projects have increased the midstream segment’s throughput volumes customer optionality and system connectivity hess midstream has also recently executed a strategic gas processing joint venture with targa resources corp that will further support the production growth in the bakken 

 

 

us tax cuts and jobs act 

the enactment of us federal tax reform commonly referred to as the us tax cuts and jobs act “act” provided for broad changes to the taxation of both domestic and foreign operations the provisions of the act including its extensive transition rules are complex and interpretive guidance continues to develop final application of the act to our operations and financial results may differ from that for which we have provisionally provided as of december 31 2017 changes could arise as regulatory and interpretive action continues to clarify aspects of the act and as changes are made to estimates that the corporation has utilized in calculating the transition impacts

no us federal tax has been accrued on the deemed repatriation of unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries a decrease in the us federal corporate tax rate to 21 from 35 resulted in a 1476 million reduction to our us federal net deferred tax asset as of december 31 2017 with a corresponding reduction in the previously established us valuation allowance a deferred tax liability of 110 million no longer meets the recognition criteria with the transition to a territorial regime for us taxation of foreign earnings and has been derecognized with a corresponding adjustment to the valuation allowance against the us federal net deferred tax asset under the transition rules related to the repeal of the alternative minimum tax regime an alternative minimum tax credit carryforward of 4 million will be refundable if not used to offset regular tax liability the previously established valuation allowance against this credit carryforward has been released consequently these tax law changes resulted in a net 4 million increase to net deferred tax asset on the balance sheet and benefit to deferred tax expense 

liquidity and capital and exploratory expenditures

in 2017 net cash provided by operating activities was 945 million 2016 795 million 2015 1981 million at december 31 2017 consolidated cash and cash equivalents were 4847 million 2016 2732 million consolidated debt was 6977 million 2016 6806 million and our consolidated debt to capitalization ratio was 361 2016 304

capital and exploratory expenditures were as follows in millions

 



exploration expenses charged to income included in ep capital and exploratory expenditures above were

 



 



in 2018 we plan to incur approximately 21 billion on ep capital and exploratory expenditures and approximately 330 million on midstream capital expenditures including equity investments 

 

 

consolidated results of operations 

results including items affecting comparability of earnings between periods

the aftertax income loss by major operating activity is summarized below

 





in the following discussion and elsewhere in this report the financial effects of certain transactions are disclosed on an aftertax basis management reviews segment earnings on an aftertax basis and uses aftertax amounts in its review of variances in segment earnings management believes that aftertax amounts are a preferable method of explaining variances in earnings since they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only the pretax amount aftertax amounts are determined by applying the income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pretax amounts

items affecting comparability of earnings between periods

the following table summarizes items of income expense that are included in net income loss and affect comparability of earnings between periods the items in the table below are explained on pages 31 through 36



the following table reconciles reported net income loss attributable to hess corporation and adjusted net income loss



adjusted net income loss attributable to hess corporation presented in this report is a nongaap financial measure which we define as reported net income loss attributable to hess corporation excluding items identified as affecting comparability of earnings between periods management uses adjusted net income loss to evaluate the corporation’s operating performance and believes that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this measure which excludes certain items that management believes are not directly related to ongoing operations and are not indicative of future business trends and operations this measure is not and should not be viewed as a substitute for us gaap net income loss

comparison of results

exploration and production

following is a summarized income statement of our ep operations

 



 

excluding the ep items affecting comparability of earnings between periods in the table on page 31 the changes in ep results are primarily attributable to changes in selling prices production and sales volumes marketing expenses cash operating costs midstream tariffs depreciation depletion and amortization exploration expenses and income taxes as discussed below

 

 

selling prices average worldwide realized crude oil selling prices including hedging were 26 higher in 2017 compared to the prior year primarily due to the increase in brent and wti crude oil prices in addition realized worldwide selling prices for natural gas liquids increased in 2017 by 84 and worldwide natural gas prices remained unchanged compared to the prior year in total higher realized selling prices improved 2017 financial results by approximately 350 million after income taxes compared with 2016 our average selling prices were as follows 



during 2017 we purchased brent crude oil price collars to hedge 20000 barrels of oil per day bopd with a weighted average contract life of 103 months in 2017 the collars had a floor price of 55 per barrel and a ceiling price of 75 per barrel we also purchased west texas intermediate wti crude oil price collars to hedge 110000 bopd with a weighted average contract life of 76 months in 2017 that had a floor price of 50 per barrel and an average ceiling price of 69 per barrel at december 31 2017 we have open wti crude oil price collars with an average monthly floor price of 50 per barrel and an average monthly ceiling price of 65 per barrel with a notional amount of 115000 bopd for full year 2018 see note 23   financial risk management activities in the notes to consolidated financial statements  

realized and unrealized movements in crude oil price collars decreased sales and other operating revenues by 59 million 59 million after income taxes in 2017 and increased sales and other operating revenues by 126 million 79 million after income taxes in 2015 there were no crude oil hedge contracts in 2016

 

 

production volumes  our daily worldwide net production was as follows 



in 2018 we expect net production excluding libya and reflecting an estimated 15000 boepd reduction due to the extended enchilada platform shutdown to average between 245000 boepd and 255000 boepd compared to full year pro forma 2017 net production excluding libya and assets sold of 242000 boepd 

production variances related to 2017 2016 and 2015 are summarized as follows

united states onshore crude oil production was lower in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to the sale of our permian assets in august 2017 onshore natural gas production was lower in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to natural decline in the utica shale play  total offshore production was lower in 2017 compared to 2016 due to production from several fields being shutin following a fire at the thirdparty operated enchilada platform in november 2017 and natural field decline p artially offset by higher production from the tubular bells field onshore crude oil production was lower in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to reduced drilling activity in the bakken shale play in response to low oil prices while the increase in natural gas liquids production was primarily due to greater processed volumes at the tioga gas plant onshore natural gas production was higher in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to a higher number of wells being on production in the utica shale play relative to the prior year total offshore production was lower in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to subsurface valve failures in three wells at the tubular bells field a shutin well to replace a subsurface valve at the conger field extended planned shutdowns on thirdparty hosted production facilities at the tubular bells and conger fields and natural field decline  our interests in permian which were sold in august averaged net production of 4000 boepd in 2017 2016 7000 boepd 2015 9000 boepd   

 

 

europe crude oil and natural gas production was lower in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to natural field decline  cr ude oil production was lower in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to lower drilling activity natural field decline and a planned shutdown at the valhall field offshore norway our interests in norway which were sold in december averaged net produc tion of 24000 boepd in 2017 2016 28000 boepd 2015 33000 boepd   

africa crude oil production in 2017 was comparable to 2016 as lower volumes from equatorial guinea which was sold in november 2017 was offset by higher production in libya  crude oil production in africa was lower in 2016 compared to 2015 as a result of reduced drilling activity in equatorial guinea and the sale of our algeria asset in the fourth quarter of 2015 our interests in equatorial guinea averaged net production of 25000 boepd in 2017 2016 33000 boepd 2015 43000 boepd   

asia   natural gas production was higher in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to first production at the north malay basin fullfield development in july 2017 natural gas production was lower in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to the planned shutdown of production facilities at the jda in 2016 to commission a booster compressor project and from lower production entitlement 

sales volumes the impact of lower sales volumes decreased aftertax results by approximately 190 million in 2017 compared to 2016 wor ldwide sales volumes from hess net production excluding purchased crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas were as follows 



marketing including purchased oil and gas this expense category is mainly comprised of costs to purchase crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas from our partners in hess operated wells or other thirdparties primarily in the us and associated transportation costs for us marketing activities the increase in 2017 compared to 2016 principally reflects the impact of higher benchmark crude oil prices on the cost of purchased volumes the decrease in 2016 compared to 2015 principally reflects the decline in crude oil prices and lower volumes purchased 

cash operating costs   cash operating costs consisting of operating costs and expenses production and severance taxes and ep general and administrative expenses decreased by 401 million in 2017 compared with the prior year 2016 197 million decrease versus 2015 the decrease in 2017 compared to 2016 is due to lower workover expenses lease operating and employee costs partially offset by higher production taxes in the bakken the decrease in 2016 compared to 2015 is due to lower production and cost reduction efforts and lower production taxes in the bakken operating costs in 2016 include higher workover costs to replace failed subsurface valves in the gulf of mexico 

midstream tariffs expense tariffs expense in 2017 increased compared to 2016 primarily due to higher shortfall fees in 2017 tariffs expense in 2016 increased compared to 2015 primarily due to increased oil gathering tariffs and shortfall fees in 2016 partially offset by lower gas volumes processed through the tioga gas plant for 2018 we estimate midstream tariffs expense to be in the range of 625 million to 650 million 

depreciation depletion and amortization depreciation depletion and amortization dda costs decreased by 377 million in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to lower production and an improved portfolio average dda rate due to the production mix  dda costs decreased in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to lower production and an improved portfolio average dda rate due to the production mix

exploration expenses   exploration expenses including items affecting comparability of earnings described below were as follows 



exploration expenses were lower in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to lower dry hole expense leasehold impairment expense geologic and seismic costs and employee expenses exploration expenses were higher in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to higher dry hole expense partially offset by lower leasehold impairment expense geologic and seismic costs and employee expenses see items affecting comparability of earnings between periods described below for 2018 we estimate exploration expenses excluding dry hole expense to be in the range of 190 million to 210 million 

income taxes the ep income tax provision was a benefit of 1842 million in 2017 2016 1587 million expense 2015 1117 million benefit excluding items affecting comparability between periods the ep income tax provision was an expense of 95 million in 2017 2016 948 million benefit 2015 731 million benefit the provision in 2017 reflects higher production from libya and lower deferred tax benefits on losses compared to the prior year commencing in 2017 we are generally not recognizing deferred tax benefit or expense in certain countries primarily the us denmark hydrocarbon tax only malaysia and guyana while we maintain valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets in these jurisdictions in accordance with the requirements of us accounting standards see ep items affecting comparability of earnings below and critical accounting policies and estimates – income taxes on page 41

midstream 

following is a summarized income statement of our midstream operations which include results for a gas plant and associated co 2 assets in the permian basin through august 2017 and water handling assets in north dakota that are whollyowned by hess







sales and other operating revenues in 2017 increased compared to 2016 primarily due to higher shortfall fees earned and higher tariff rates and throughput volumes  partially offset by lower rail export revenue associated with thirdparty rail charges and the sale of our permian assets in august 2017 total revenues and nonoperating income in 2016 decreased compared to 2015 primarily as a result of lower rail export revenue associated with thirdparty rail charges partially offset by recognition of shortfall fees earned  

operating costs and expenses were lower in 2017 compared to 2016 p rimarily due to lower thirdparty rail charges and the sale of our permian assets in august 2017  operating costs and expenses were lower in 2016 compared to 2015 p rimarily due to a decrease in thirdparty rail charges  dda expenses were higher in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to newly completed gathering pipelines and related facilities that were placed in service dda expenses were higher in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to c apital expenditures on gathering assets and railcars that were placed in service 

the increase in interest expense in 2017 compared to 2016 and 2016 compared to 2015 reflects borrowings by hess infrastructure partners lp

for 2018 we estimate net income attributable to hess corporation from the midstream segment to be in the range of 105 million to 115 million 

items affecting comparability of earnings between periods we recognized a pretax loss of 57 million 34 million after income taxes and noncontrolling interest in 2017 related to the sale of our midstream assets in the permian basin midstream results in 2016 included a pretax charge of 67 million 21 million after income taxes and noncontrolling interest to impair older specification rail cars 

 

 

corporate interest and other 

the following table summarizes corporate interest and other expenses



corporate and other expenses excluding items affecting comparability were higher in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to higher legal costs increased pension settlement charges in 2017 and the recognition of a nonrecurring gain of 8 million in 2016  corporate and other expenses were lower in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to reductions in employee costs professional fees and other general and administrative expenses and the benefit of higher interest income and nonoperating income in 2018 aftertax corporate and other expenses excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods are estimated to be in the range of 105 million to 115 million 

interest expense was higher in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to slightly higher average borrowings capitalized interest expense was higher in 2017 compared to 2016 due to increased activity at the hess operated stampede development project and sanction of the liza field phase 1 development project during 2017 interest expense was higher in 2016 compared to 2015 but the increase in capitalized interest expense was greater over the same period with 2016 reflecting increased activity at the stampede development project in 2018 aftertax interest expense net is estimated to be in the range of 345 million to 355 million as interest capitalization on the stampede development will cease upon first production

the benefit for income taxes is lower in 2017 compared to 2016 due to us generally not recognizing deferred tax benefit or expense in the us while we maintain valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets in accordance with the requirements of us accounting standards this accounting treatment commenced on december 31 2016 see items affecting comparability of earnings below and critical accounting policies and estimates – income taxes on page 41

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table sets forth certain relevant measures of our liquidity and capital resources at december 31









cash flows

the following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows



operating activities    

in 2017 net cash provided by operating activities was 945 million 2016 795 million 2015 1981 million in 2017 operating cash flows increased compared to 2016 primarily due to higher benchmark crude oil prices and lower operating costs partially offset by lower production volumes changes in working capital in 2017 were a use of cash of 780 million and primarily related to higher accounts receivable due to higher crude oil prices abandonment expenditures premiums on crude oil hedging contracts pension contributions contract termination payments for an offshore drilling rig and crude oil delivered as line fill in 2016 operating cash flows decreased compared to 2015 primarily due to declining benchmark crude oil prices and changes in production volumes 

investing activities   

in 2017 additions to property plant and equipment were lower compared to 2016 primarily due to lower development expenditures at north malay basin in the current year  partially offset by increased investments in bakken and guyana in 2017 the decrease in additions to property plant and equipment in 2016 compared to 2015 is primarily related to reduced drilling activity bakken utica norway denmark and equatorial guinea and reduced development expenditures tubular bells north malay basin and the jda 

in 2017 proceeds from the sale of assets of 3296 million 2016 140 million 2015 50 million related to the divestiture of our interests in equatorial guinea norway our enhanced oil recovery assets in the permian basin and noncore acreage onshore united states 

 

 

financing activities 

in 2017 hess midstream partners lp received proceeds of 3655 million from the issuance of common units in an initial public offering of which 350 million was distributed 5050 to hess corporation and gip borrowings for debt with maturities in excess of 90 days were 800 million in 2017 2016 1496 million 2015 600 million while associated repayments of debt were 459 million 2016 1455 million 2015 67 million common and preferred stock dividends paid were 363 million in 2017 2016 350 million 2015 287 million and w e settled the repurchase of 110 million of common stock in 2017 2016  2015 142 million net outflows to noncontrolling interests were 243 million in 2017 2016 23 million net outflow 2015 2296 million net inflow in 2016 we issued 28750000 shares of common stock and depositary shares representing 575000 shares of 8 series a mandatory convertible preferred stock for total net proceeds of 164 billion  

future capital requirements and resources

at december 31 2017 hess corporation had 45 billion in cash and cash equivalents excluding midstream and total liquidity including available committed credit facilities of approximately 89 billion the corporation has no significant nearterm debt maturities 

net production in 2018 is forecast to be in the range of 245000 boepd to 255000 boepd excluding libya and we expect our 2018 ep capital and exploratory expenditures will be approximately 21 billion  based on current forward strip crude oil prices we forecast a net operating cash flow deficit including capital expenditures in 2018 the corporation expects to fund its 2018 net operating cash flow deficit including capital expenditures reduce debt by 500 million and repurchase 380 million of common stock with existing cash and cash equivalents

on february 15 2018 hess corporation redeemed 350 million principal amount of 8125 notes due 2019 for 370 million 

the table below summarizes the capacity usage and available capacity of our borrowing and letter of credit facilities at december 31 2017











on december 1 2017 the corporation amended its 40 billion syndicated revolving credit facility that expires in january 2020 by extending the facility for one year to january 2021 with a 37 billion commitment during the extension period borrowings on the facility will generally bear interest at 130 above the london interbank offered rate libor the interest rate will be higher if our credit rating is lowered the facility contains a financial covenant that limits the amount of the total borrowings on the last day of each fiscal quarter to 60 of the corporation’s total capitalization defined as total debt plus stockholders’ equity as of december 31 2017 hess corporation had no outstanding borrowings under this facility and was in compliance with this financial covenant 

we had 246 million in letters of credit outstanding at december 31 2017 2016 188 million which primarily relate to our international operations see also note 23 financial risk management activities in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

we also have a shelf registration under which we may issue additional debt securities warrants common stock or preferred stock

in november 2017 hip amended its senior unsecured syndicated credit facilities at december 31 2017 hip has 800 million of senior secured syndicated credit facilities consisting of a 600 million 5year revolving credit facility and a drawn 200 million 5year term loan a facility the revolving credit facility can be used for borrowings and letters of credit to 

 

 

fund the joint venture’s operating activities and capital expenditures borrowings under the 5year term loan a facility will generally bear interest at libor plus an applicable margin ranging from 155 to 250 while the applicable margin for the 5 year syndicated revolving credit facility ranges from 1275 to 2000 the interest rate is subject to adjustment based on hip’s leverage ratio which is calculated as total debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda  if hip obtains an investment grade credit rating as defined in the amended credit agreement pricing levels will be based on the credit ratings in effect from time to time the credit facilities contain financial covenants that generally require a lev erage ratio of no more than 50 to 10 for the prior four fiscal quarters and an interest coverage ratio which is calculated as ebitda to cash interest expense of no less than 225 to 10 for the prior four fiscal quarters the amended credit agreement includes a secured leverage ratio test not to exceed 375 to 100 for so long as the facilities remain secured hip is in compliance with these financial covenants at december 31 2017 outstanding borrowings under this credit facility are nonrecourse t o hess corporation at december 31 2017 hip’s revolving credit facility was undrawn and borrowings under the term loan a facility amounted to 200 million excluding deferred issuance costs the credit facilities are secured by firstpriority perfected liens on substantially all of hip’s and certain of its whollyowned subsidiaries’ directly owned assets including its equity interests in certain subsidiaries subject to customary exclusions 

hess midstream partners lp the “partnership” has a 300 million 4year senior secured syndicated revolving credit facility that became available for utilization at completion of its initial public offering in april 2017 the credit facility can be used for borrowings and letters of credit to fund operating activities and capital expenditures of the partnership and expires march 2021 borrowings on the credit facility will generally bear interest at libor plus an applicable margin of 1275 the interest rate is subject to adjustment based on the partnership’s leverage ratio which is calculated as total debt to ebitda if the partnership obtains credit ratings pricing levels will be based on the credit ratings in effect from time to time the partnership is subject to customary covenants in the credit agreement including financial covenants that generally require a leverage ratio of no more than 45 to 10 for the prior four fiscal quarters the credit facility is secured by first priority perfected liens on substantially all directly owned assets of the partnership and its whollyowned subsidiaries including equity interests in subsidiaries subject to certain customary exclusions outstanding borrowings under this credit facility are nonrecourse to hess corporation at december 31 2017 this facility was undrawn

credit ratings

two of the three major credit rating agencies that rate the corporation’s debt have assigned an investment grade rating at december 31 2017 we have investment grade credit ratings with stable outlook from standard and poor’s ratings services bbb and fitch ratings bbb moody’s investors service has rated our debt at ba1 with a stable outlook

the consequence of lower credit ratings is an increase in interest rates and facility fees on our credit facilities and the potential for additional required collateral under operating agreements as of december 31 2017 based on our current credit ratings we may be required to issue additional collateral in the form of letters of credit up to approximately 135 million if fitch or sp were to reduce their rating on our unsecured debt below investment grade we estimate that we could be required to issue additional letters of credit up to approximately 240 million as of december 31 2017

in the fourth quarter of 2017 hip obtained it first credit ratings from ratings agencies at december 31 2017 hip’s senior unsecured debt is rated bb by standard and poor’s ratings services ba3 by moody’s investors service and bb by fitch ratings

contractual obligations and contingencies

the following table shows aggregate information about certain contractual obligations at december 31 2017





 

 

capital expenditures represen t amounts that were contractually committed at december 31 2017 including the portion of our planned capital expenditure program for 2018 obligations for operating expenses include commitments for oil and gas production expenses seismic purchases and other normal business expenses other liabilities reflect contractually committed obligations in the consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2017 including pension plan liabilities and estimates for uncertain income tax positions the corporation and certain of its subsidiaries lease drilling rigs office space and other assets for varying periods under leases accounted for as operating leases 

offbalance sheet arrangements

at december 31 2017 we had 31 million in letters of credit for which we are contingently liable see also note 21 guarantees contingencies and commitments in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

foreign operations

at december 31 2017 we conducted ep activities outside the us principally in africa libya asia joint development area of malaysiathailand and malaysia south america guyana and suriname denmark and canada therefore we are subject to the risks associated with foreign operations including political risk tax law changes currency risk corruption and acts of terrorism see item 1a risk factors for further details

critical accounting policies and estimates

accounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and revenues and expenses in the statement of consolidated income  the accounting methods used can affect net income equity and various financial statement ratios however our accounting policies generally do not change cash flows or liquidity

accounting for exploration and development costs ep activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage including lease bonuses brokers’ fees and other related costs are capitalized annual lease rentals exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred costs of drilling and equipping productive wells including development dry holes and related production facilities are capitalized in production operations costs of injected co 2 for tertiary recovery are expensed as incurred 

the costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if 1 the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and 2 sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operational viability of the project if either of those criteria is not met or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project the capitalized well costs are charged to expense indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves and the economic and operating viability of a project include commitment of project personnel active negotiations for sales contracts with customers negotiations with governments operators and contractors and firm plans for additional drilling and other factors

crude oil and natural gas reserves the determination of estimated proved reserves is a significant element in arriving at the results of operations of ep activities the estimates of proved reserves affect well capitalizations the unit of production depreciation rates of proved properties and wells and equipment as well as impairment testing of oil and gas assets and goodwill 

for reserves to be booked as proved they must be determined with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations in addition government and project operator approvals must be obtained and depending on the amount of the project cost senior management or the board of directors must commit to fund the project we maintain our own internal reserve estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work directly with the oil and gas properties our technical staff updates reserve estimates throughout the year based on evaluations of new wells performance reviews new technical data and other studies to provide consistency throughout the corporation standard reserve estimation guidelines definitions reporting reviews and approval practices are used the internal reserve estimates are subject to internal technical audits and senior management review we also engage an independent thirdparty consulting firm to audit approximately 80 of our total proved reserves each year

proved reserves are calculated using the average price during the twelvemonth period ending december 31 determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the price on the first day of each month within the year unless prices are defined by contractual agreements excluding escalations based on future conditions as discussed in item 1a risk factors  crude oil prices are volatile which can have an impact on our proved reserves if crude oil prices in 2018 are at levels below that used in determining 2017 proved reserves we may recognize negative revisions to our december 31 2017 proved undeveloped reserves in addition we may recognize negative revisions to proved developed reserves which can vary significantly by 

 

 

asset due to differing operating co st structures conversely price increases in 2018 above those used in determining 2017 proved reserves could result in positive revisions to proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves at december 31 2018 it is difficult to estimate the magnitude of any potential net negative or positive change in proved reserves as of december 31 2018 due to a number of factors that are currently unknown including 2018 crude oil prices any revisions based on 2018 reservoir performance and the levels to which industry costs will change in response to movements in commodity prices a 10 change in proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves at december 31 2017 would result in an approximate 200 million pretax change in depreciation depletion and amor tization expense for 2018 see the supplementary oil and gas data on pages 81 through 91 in the a ccompanying financial statements for additional information on our oil and gas reserves 

midstream joint venture on july 1 2015 we sold a 50 interest in hip to gip for net cash consideration of approximately 26 billion we consolidate the activities of hip which qualifies as a variable interest entity vie under us generally accepted accounting principles we have concluded that we are the primary beneficiary of the vie as defined in the accounting standards since we have the power through our 50 ownership to direct those activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of hip and are obligated to absorb losses or have the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to hip this conclusion was based on a qualitative analysis that considered hip’s governance structure the commercial agreements between hip and us and the voting rights established between the members which provide us the ability to control the operations of hip 

impairment of longlived assets we review long‑lived assets including oil and gas fields for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered long‑lived assets are tested based on identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities if the carrying amounts of the longlived assets are not expected to be recovered by estimated undiscounted future net cash flows the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded the amount of impairment is determined based on the estimated fair value of the assets generally determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows an income valuation approach or by a market‑based valuation approach which are level 3 fair value measurements 

in the case of oil and gas fields the present value of future net cash flows is based on management’s best estimate of future prices which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices applied to projected production volumes and discounted at a riskadjusted rate the projected production volumes represent reserves including probable reserves expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures the production volumes prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairment will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows since the standardized measure requires the use of historical twelvemonth average prices 

our impairment tests of long‑lived ep producing assets are based on our best estimates of future production volumes including recovery factors selling prices operating and capital costs the timing of future production and other factors which are updated each time an impairment test is performed we could have impairment if the projected production volumes from oil and gas fields decrease crude oil and natural gas selling prices decline significantly for an extended period or future estimated capital and operating costs increase significantly as a result of the extended period of low crude oil prices we tested our oil and gas properties for impairment see note 3 impairment in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

impairment of goodwill goodwill is tested for impairment annually on october 1 st or when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable based on a twostep process we conduct the goodwill test at a reporting unit level which is defined in accounting standards as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment the reporting unit or units used in an evaluation and measurement of goodwill for impairment testing are determined from a number of factors including the manner in which the business is managed at december 31 2017 our midstream operating segment had goodwill of 360 million that resulted from an allocation from our ep segment upon the formation of the midstream segment in 2015 our ep segment has no goodwill at december 31 2017 

in step one of the impairment test the fair value of a reporting unit is compared with its carrying amount including goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill is not impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value we perform step two to determine possible impairment by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by assuming the reporting unit is purchased at fair value with assets and liabilities of the reporting unit being reflected at fair value in the same manner as the accounting prescribed for a business combination the resulting excess of fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to the reporting unit’s assets and liabilities represents the implied fair value of goodwill if the implied fair value of goodwill were less than its carrying amount an impairment loss would be recorded fair value for the midstream operating segment is based on a market approach using the exchange price of hess midstream partners lp which is a consolidated publicly traded master limited partnership that operates substantially all of our midstream segment assets

 

 

income taxes judgments are required in the determination and recognition of income tax assets and liabilities in the financial statements these judgments include the requirement to only recognize the financial statement effect of a tax position when management believes that it is more likely than not that based on the technical merits the position will be sustained upon examination 

we have net operating loss carryforwards or credit carryforwards in multiple jurisdictions and have recorded deferred tax assets for those losses and credits additionally we have deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized if when tested under the relevant accounting standards it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized 

the accounting standards require the evaluation of all available positive and negative evidence giving weight based on the evidence’s relative objectivity in evaluating potential sources of positive evidence we consider the reversal of taxable temporary differences taxable income in carryback and carryforward periods the availability of tax planning strategies the existence of appreciated assets estimates of future taxable income and other factors estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas reserves selling prices and other subjective operating assumptions that are consistent with internal business forecasts in evaluating potential sources of negative evidence we consider a cumulative loss in recent years any history of operating losses or tax credit carryforwards expiring unused losses expected in early future years unsettled circumstances that if unfavorably resolved would adversely affect future operations and profit levels on a continuing basis in future years and carryback or carryforward periods that are so brief that it would limit realization of tax benefits if a significant deductible temporary difference is expected to reverse in a single year due to a sustained low commodity price environment we remained in a threeyear cumulative consolidated loss position as of december 31 2017 a threeyear cumulative consolidated loss constitutes objective negative evidence to which the accounting standards require we assign significant weight relative to subjective evidence such as our estimates of future taxable income we are generally not recognizing deferred tax benefit or expense in certain countries primarily the us denmark hydrocarbon tax only malaysia and guyana while we maintain valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets in these jurisdictions 

as of december 31 2017 the consolidated balance sheet reflects a 5199 million valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets for multiple jurisdictions based on the evaluation of the accounting standards described above the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable however could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income change or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight is given to subjective evidence such as expected future growth 

asset retirement obligations we have material legal obligations to remove and dismantle long‑lived assets and to restore land or seabed at certain ep locations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we recognize a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations in addition the fair value of any legally required conditional asset retirement obligation is recorded if the liability can be reasonably estimated we capitalize such costs as a component of the carrying amount of the underlying assets in the period in which the liability is incurred in subsequent periods the liability is accreted and the asset is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset we estimate the fair value of these obligations by discounting projected future payments that will be required to satisfy the obligations in determining these estimates we are required to make several assumptions and judgments related to the scope of dismantlement timing of settlement interpretation of legal requirements inflationary factors and discount rate in addition there are other external factors which could significantly affect the ultimate settlement costs for these obligations including changes in environmental regulations and other statutory requirements fluctuations in industry costs and foreign currency exchange rates and advances in technology as a result our estimates of asset retirement obligations are subject to revision due to the factors described above changes in estimates prior to settlement result in adjustments to both the liability and related asset values 

retirement plans we have funded noncontributory defined benefit pension plans an unfunded supplemental pension plan and an unfunded postretirement medical plan we recognize the net change in the funded status of the projected benefit obligation for these plans in the consolidated balance sheet  

the determination of the obligations and expenses related to these plans are based on several actuarial assumptions the most significant of which relate to the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations expected long‑term rates of return on plan assets the rate of future increases in compensation levels and participant mortality assumptions these assumptions represent estimates made by us some of which can be affected by external factors for example the discount rate used to estimate our projected benefit obligation is based on a portfolio of high‑quality fixed income debt instruments with maturities that approximate the expected payment of plan obligations the expected return on plan assets is developed from the expected future returns for each asset category weighted by the target allocation of pension assets to that asset category t he future expected return assumptions for individual asset categories are largely based on 

 

 

inputs from various investment experts regarding their future return expectations for particular asset categories changes in these assumptions can have a material impact on the amounts reported in our financial statements 

derivatives we utilize derivative instruments including futures forwards options and swaps individually or in combination to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in the prices of crude oil and natural gas as well as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates all derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet  our policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative the changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized currently in earnings derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions cash flow hedges or hedges of firm commitments fair value hedges the effective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income loss amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings the ineffective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recorded currently in earnings changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings the change in fair value of the related hedged commitment is recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized currently in earnings 

fair value measurements we use various valuation approaches in determining fair value for financial instruments including the market and income approaches our fair value measurements also include nonperformance risk and time value of money considerations counterparty credit is considered for receivable balances and our credit is considered for accrued liabilities 

we also record certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value when required by generally accepted accounting principles these fair value measurements are recorded in connection with business combinations qualifying nonmonetary exchanges the initial recognition of asset retirement obligations and any impairment of longlived assets equity method investments or goodwill

we determine fair value in accordance with the fair value measurements accounting standard which established a hierarchy for the inputs used to measure fair value based on the source of the inputs which generally range from quoted prices for identical instruments in a principal trading market level 1 to estimates determined using related market data level 3 including discounted cash flows and other unobservable data  measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered level 2 when level 1 inputs are available within a particular market those inputs are selected for determination of fair value over level 2 or 3 inputs in the same market multiple inputs may be used to measure fair value however the level of fair value for each physical derivative and financial asset or liability is based on the lowest significant input level within this fair value hierarchy 

environment health and safety

we recognize that climate change is a global environmental concern we assess monitor and take measures to reduce our carbon footprint at existing and planned operations we are committed to complying with all greenhouse gas ghg emissions mandates and the responsible management of ghg emissions at our facilities

we will have continuing expenditures for environmental assessment and remediation sites where corrective action may be necessary include onshore ep facilities sites from discontinued operations as to which we retained liability and although not currently significant “superfund” sites where we have been named a potentially responsible party

we accrue for environmental assessment and remediation expenses when the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable at december 31 2017 our reserve for estimated remediation liabilities was approximately 80 million we expect that existing reserves for environmental liabilities will adequately cover costs to assess and remediate known sites our remediation spending was approximately 15 million in 2017 2016 10 million 2015 13 million the level of other expenditures to comply with federal state local and foreign country environmental regulations is difficult to quantify as such costs are captured as mostly indistinguishable components of our capital expenditures and operating expenses

 

 




 ite m 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

as discussed in note 23  financial risk management activities  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  in the normal course of our business we are exposed to commodity risks related to changes in the prices of crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas as well as changes in interest rates and foreign currency values in the disclosures that follow financial risk management activities refer to the mitigation of these risks through hedging activities

controls we maintain a control environment under the direction of our chief risk officer controls over instruments used in financial risk management activities include volumetric and term limits our treasury department is responsible for administering and monitoring foreign exchange rate and interest rate hedging programs using similar controls and processes where applicable hedging strategies are reviewed annually by the audit committee of the board of directors 

instruments we primarily use forward commodity contracts foreign exchange forward contracts futures swaps and options to affect risk management activities these contracts are generally widely traded instruments with standardized terms the following describes these instruments and how we use them 









financial risk management activities

we have outstanding foreign exchange contracts with a total notional amount of 52 million at december 31 2017 that are used to reduce our exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates for various currencies the change in fair value of foreign exchange contracts from a 10 strengthening of the us dollar exchange rate is estimated to be a loss of approximately 5 million at december 31 2017

at december 31 2017 our outstanding long‑term debt of 6977 million including current maturities had a fair value of 7718 million a 15 increase or decrease in the rate of interest would decrease or increase the fair value of debt by approximately 500 million or 560 million respectively

at december 31 2017 we have outstanding west texas intermediate wti crude oil collar contracts with a notional amount of 115000 bopd for calendar 2018 with an average monthly floor price of 50 per barrel and an average monthly ceiling price of 65 per barrel as of december 31 2017 an assumed 10 increase in the forward wti crude oil prices used in determining the fair value of our crude oil collars would reduce the fair value of these derivatives instruments by approximately 120 million while an assumed 10 decrease in the same wti crude oil prices would increase the fair value of these derivative instruments by approximately 70 million see note 23  financial risk management activities  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  

in 2017 we recorded a pretax charge of 22 million 22 million after income taxes related to certain crude oil collars not designated as cash flow hedges the dedesignation was as a result of expected production downtime caused by a fire at the thirdparty operated enchilada platform in the gulf of mexico

emergency preparedness and response plans and procedures

we have in place a series of business and assetspecific emergency preparedness response and business continuity plans that detail procedures for rapid and effective emergency response and environmental mitigation activities these plans are risk appropriate and are maintained reviewed and updated as necessary to confirm their accuracy and suitability where appropriate they are also reviewed and approved by the relevant host government authorities

responder training and drills are routinely held worldwide to assess and continually improve the effectiveness of our plans our contractors service providers representatives from government agencies and where applicable joint venture partners participate in the drills to help ensure that emergency procedures are comprehensive and can be effectively implemented

to complement internal capabilities and to help ensure coverage for our global operations we maintain membership contracts with a network of local regional and global oil spill response and emergency response organizations at the regional and global level these organizations include clean gulf associates cga marine spill response corporation msrc marine well containment company mwcc wild well control wwc subsea well intervention service swis and oil spill response limited osrl cga and msrc are domestic spill response organizations and mwcc provides the equipment and personnel to contain underwater well control incidents in the gulf of mexico wwc provides firefighting well control and engineering services globally osrl is a global response organization and is available when needed to assist us anywhere in the world in addition to owning response assets in their own right the organization maintains business relationships that provide immediate access to additional critical response support services if required these owned response assets include nearly 300 recovery and storage vessels and barges more than 250 skimmers over 600000 feet of boom 9 capping stacks and significant quantities of dispersants and other ancillary equipment including aircraft in addition to external well control and oil spill response support we have contracts with wildlife environmental meteorology incident management medical and security resources if we were to engage these organizations to obtain additional critical response support services we would fund such services and seek reimbursement under our insurance coverage as described below in certain circumstances we pursue and enter into mutual aid agreements with other companies and government cooperatives to receive and provide oil spill response equipment and personnel support we maintain close associations with emergency response organizations through our representation on the executive committees of cga and msrc as well as the board of directors of osrl

we continue to participate in a number of industry‑wide task forces that are studying better ways to assess the risk of and prevent onshore and offshore incidents access and control blowouts in subsea environments and improve containment and recovery methods the task forces are working closely with the oil and gas industry and international government agencies to implement improvements and increase the effectiveness of oil spill prevention preparedness response and recovery processes

insurance coverage and indemnification

we maintain insurance coverage that includes coverage for physical damage to our property thirdparty liability workers’ compensation and employers’ liability general liability sudden and accidental pollution and other coverage this insurance coverage is subject to deductibles exclusions and limitations and there is no assurance that such coverage will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences and damages

the amount of insurance covering physical damage to our property and liability related to negative environmental effects resulting from a sudden and accidental pollution event excluding atlantic named windstorm coverage for which we are self‑insured varies by asset based on the assets estimated replacement value or the estimated maximum loss in the case of a catastrophic event first party coverage consists of two tiers of insurance the first 400 million of coverage is provided through an industry mutual insurance group above this 400 million threshold insurance is carried which ranges in value up to 319 billion in total depending on the asset coverage level as described above additionally we carry insurance that provides thirdparty coverage for general liability and sudden and accidental pollution up to 108 billion which coverage under a standard joint operating arrangement would be reduced to our participating interest

our insurance policies renew at various dates each year future insurance coverage could increase in cost and may include higher deductibles or retentions or additional exclusions or limitations in addition some forms of insurance may become unavailable in the future or unavailable on terms that are deemed economically acceptable

generally our drilling contracts and most of our other offshore services contracts provide for a mutual hold harmless indemnity structure whereby each party to the contract the corporation and contractor indemnifies the other party for injuries or damages to their personnel and property and often those of its contractorssubcontractors regardless of fault 

 

 

 

variations may include indemnity exclusions to the extent a claim is attributable to the gross negligence andor willful misconduct of a party third ‑party claims on the other hand are generally allocated on a fault basis 

we are customarily responsible for and indemnify the contractor against all claims including those from third‑parties to the extent attributable to pollution or contamination by substances originating from our reservoirs or other property regardless of cause including gross negligence and willful misconduct and the contractor is responsible for and indemnifies us for all claims attributable to pollution emanating from the contractor’s property additionally we are generally liable for all of our own losses and most third‑party claims associated with catastrophic losses such as damage to reservoirs blowouts cratering and loss of hole regardless of cause although exceptions for losses attributable to gross negligence andor willful misconduct do exist lastly some offshore services contracts include overall limitations of the contractor’s liability equal to the value of the contract or a fixed amount

under a standard joint operating agreement joa each party is liable for all claims arising under the joa to the extent of its participating interest operator or nonoperator variations include indemnity exclusions when the claim is based upon the gross negligence andor willful misconduct of the operator in which case the operator is solely liable the parties to the joa may continue to be jointly and severally liable for claims made by thirdparties in some jurisdictions further under some production sharing contracts between a governmental entity and commercial parties liability of the commercial parties to the government entity is joint and several

environmental

compliance with various existing environmental and pollution control regulations imposed by federal state local and foreign governments is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations but increasingly stringent environmental regulations have resulted and will likely continue to result in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us and the oil and gas industry in general we spent approximately 10 million in 2016 for environmental remediation the level of other expenditures to comply with federal state local and foreign country environmental regulations is difficult to quantify as such costs are captured as mostly indistinguishable components of our capital expenditures and operating expenses for further discussion of environmental matters see environment health and safety in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

our business activities and the value of our securities are subject to significant risks including the risk factors described below these risk factors could negatively affect our operations financial condition liquidity and results of operations and as a result holders and purchasers of our securities could lose part or all of their investments it is possible that additional risks relating to our securities may be described in a prospectus supplement if we issue securities in the future

our business and operating results are highly dependent on the market prices of crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas which can be very volatile our estimated proved reserves revenue operating cash flows operating margins liquidity financial condition and future earnings are highly dependent on the benchmark market prices of crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas and our associated realized price differentials which are volatile and influenced by numerous factors beyond our control the major foreign oil producing countries including members of opec may exert considerable influence over the supply and price of crude oil and refined petroleum products their ability or inability to agree on a common policy on rates of production and other matters may have a significant impact on the oil markets other factors include but are not limited to worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas political conditions and events including instability changes in governments or armed conflict around the world and in particular in crude oil or natural gas producing regions the cost of exploring for developing and producing crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas the price and availability of alternative fuels or other forms of energy the effect of energy conservation and environmental protection efforts and overall economic conditions globally the sentiment of commodities trading markets as well as other supply and demand factors may also influence the selling prices of crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas average prices for 2016 were 4347 per barrel for wti 2015 4876 2014 9291 and 4513 per barrel for brent 2015 5360 2014 9945 in order to manage the potential volatility of cash flows and credit requirements we maintain significant bank credit facilities an inability to access renew or replace such credit facilities or access other sources of funding as they mature would negatively impact our liquidity 

if we fail to successfully increase our reserves our future crude oil and natural gas production will be adversely impacted we own or have access to a finite amount of oil and gas reserves which will be depleted over time replacement of oil and gas production and reserves including proved undeveloped reserves is subject to successful exploration drilling development activities and enhanced recovery programs therefore future oil and gas production is dependent on technical success in finding and developing additional hydrocarbon reserves exploration activity involves the interpretation of seismic and other geological and geophysical data which does not always successfully predict the presence of commercial quantities of hydrocarbons drilling risks include unexpected adverse conditions irregularities in pressure or formations equipment failure blowouts and weather interruptions future developments may be affected by unforeseen reservoir conditions which negatively affect recovery factors or flow rates reserve replacement can also be achieved through acquisition similar risks however may be encountered in the production of oil and gas on properties acquired from others in addition to the technical risks to reserve replacement replacing reserves and developing future production is also influenced by the price of crude oil and natural gas and costs of drilling and development activities persistent lower crude oil and natural gas prices such as those currently prevailing may have the effect of reducing capital available for exploration and development activity and may render certain development projects uneconomic or delay their completion and may result in negative revisions to existing reserves while increasing drilling and development costs could negatively affect expected economic returns 

there are inherent uncertainties in estimating quantities of proved reserves and discounted future net cash flows and actual quantities may be lower than estimated numerous uncertainties exist in estimating quantities of proved reserves and future net revenues from those reserves actual future production oil and gas prices revenues taxes capital expenditures operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates and could materially affect the estimated quantities of our proved reserves and the related future net revenues in addition reserve estimates may be subject to downward or upward changes based on production performance purchases or sales of properties results of future development prevailing oil and gas prices production sharing contracts which may decrease reserves as crude oil and natural gas prices increase and other factors crude oil prices declined significantly in 2015 and to a lesser extent in 2016 resulting in reductions to our reported proved reserves if crude oil prices in 2017 average below prices used to determine proved reserves at december 31 2016 it could have an adverse effect on our estimated proved reserves and the value of our business see crude oil and natural gas reserves in critical accounting policies and estimates in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

we do not always control decisions made under joint operating agreements and the parties under such agreements may fail to meet their obligations we conduct many of our ep operations through joint operating agreements with other parties under which we may not control decisions either because we do not have a controlling interest or are not operator under the agreement there is risk that these parties may at any time have economic business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours and therefore decisions may be made which are not what we believe is in our best interest 

 

 

 

moreover parties to these agreements may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone in either case the value of our investment may be adversely affected 

we are subject to changing laws and regulations and other governmental actions that can significantly and adversely affect our business federal state local territorial and foreign laws and regulations relating to tax increases and retroactive tax claims disallowance of tax credits and deductions expropriation or nationalization of property mandatory government participation cancellation or amendment of contract rights imposition of capital controls or blocking of funds changes in import and export regulations limitations on access to exploration and development opportunities antibribery or anticorruption laws as well as other political developments may affect our operations 

we have substantial capital requirements and we may not be able to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms if at all the exploration development and production of crude oil and natural gas involves substantial costs which may not be fully funded from operations for example in 2016 we had a significant net loss and if commodity prices remain low through 2017 we are forecasting a net loss for 2017 two of the three major credit rating agencies that rate our debt have assigned an investment grade rating in february 2016 standard and poor’s ratings services sp lowered our investment grade credit rating one notch to bbb with stable outlook and moody’s investors service moody’s lowered our credit rating to ba1 with stable outlook which is below investment grade in december 2016 fitch ratings fitch lowered our investment grade credit rating one notch to bbb with stable outlook in february 2017 sp reaffirmed our investment grade credit rating of bbb with stable outlook although currently we do not have any borrowings under our longterm credit facility further ratings downgrades continued weakness in the oil and gas industry or negative outcomes within commodity and financial markets could adversely impact our access to capital markets by increasing the costs of financing or by impacting our ability to obtain financing on satisfactory terms or at all in addition further ratings downgrades may require that we issue letters of credit or provide other forms of collateral under certain contractual requirements any inability to access capital markets could adversely impact our financial adaptability and our ability to execute our strategy and may also expose us to heightened exposure to credit risk 

political instability in areas where we operate can adversely affect our business some of the international areas in which we operate and the partners with whom we operate are politically less stable than other areas and partners and may be subject to civil unrest conflict insurgency geographic territorial border disputes corruption security risks and labor unrest political and civil unrest in north africa and the middle east has affected and may affect our operations in these areas as well as oil and gas markets generally the threat of terrorism around the world also poses additional risks to the operations of the oil and gas industry 

our oil and gas operations are subject to environmental risks and environmental laws and regulations that can result in significant costs and liabilities our oil and gas operations like those of the industry are subject to environmental risks such as oil spills produced water spills gas leaks and ruptures and discharges of substances or gases that could expose us to substantial liability for pollution or other environmental damage our operations are also subject to numerous us federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations non‑compliance with these laws and regulations may subject us to administrative civil or criminal penalties remedial cleanups and natural resource damages or other liabilities in addition increasingly stringent environmental regulations have resulted and will likely continue to result in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us and the oil and gas industry in general similarly we have material legal obligations to dismantle remove and abandon production facilities and wells that will occur many years in the future in most cases these estimates may be impacted by future changes in regulations and other uncertainties 

concerns have been raised in certain jurisdictions where we have operations concerning the safety and environmental impact of the drilling and development of shale oil and gas resources particularly hydraulic fracturing water usage flaring of associated natural gas and air emissions while we believe that these operations can be conducted safely and with minimal impact on the environment regulatory bodies are responding to these concerns and may impose moratoriums and new regulations on such drilling operations that would likely have the effect of prohibiting or delaying such operations and increasing their cost

climate change initiatives may result in significant operational changes and expenditures reduced demand for our products and adversely affect our business we recognize that climate change is a global environmental concern continuing political and social attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national regional or local legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions these agreements and measures may require significant equipment modifications operational changes taxes or purchase of emission credits to reduce emission of greenhouse gases from our operations which may result in substantial capital expenditures and compliance operating maintenance and remediation costs in addition our production is used to produce petroleum fuels which through normal customer use may result in the emission of greenhouse gases regulatory initiatives to reduce the use of these fuels may reduce demand for crude oil and other hydrocarbons and have an adverse effect on our 

 

 

 

sales volumes revenues and margins the imposition and enforcement of stringent greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets could severely and adversely impact the oil and gas industry and significantly reduce the value of our business 

our industry is highly competitive and many of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than we have the petroleum industry is highly competitive and very capital intensive we encounter competition from numerous companies in each of our activities including acquiring rights to explore for crude oil and natural gas many competitors including national oil companies are larger and have substantially greater resources we are also in competition with producers of other forms of energy increased competition for worldwide oil and gas assets could significantly increase the cost of acquiring oil and gas assets in addition competition for drilling services technical expertise and equipment may affect the availability of technical personnel and drilling rigs resulting in increased capital and operating costs 

catastrophic events whether naturally occurring or man‑made may materially affect our operations and financial conditions our oil and gas operations are subject to unforeseen occurrences which have affected us from time to time and which may damage or destroy assets interrupt operations and have other significant adverse effects examples of catastrophic risks include hurricanes fires explosions blowouts such as the thirdparty accident at the macondo prospect pipeline interruptions and ruptures severe weather geological events labor disputes or cyber‑attacks although we maintain insurance coverage against property and casualty losses there can be no assurance that such insurance will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences and damages moreover some forms of insurance may be unavailable in the future or be available only on terms that are deemed economically unacceptable 

significant time delays between the estimated and actual occurrence of critical events associated with development projects may result in material negative economic consequences we are involved in several large development projects and the completion of those projects may be delayed beyond what was originally anticipated such examples include but are not limited to delays in receiving necessary approvals from project members or regulatory agencies timely access to necessary equipment availability of necessary personnel construction delays unfavorable weather conditions and equipment failures this may lead to delays and differences between estimated and actual timing of critical events these delays could impact our future results of operations and cash flows 

departures of key members from our senior management team andor difficulty in recruiting and retaining adequate numbers of experienced technical personnel could negatively impact our ability to deliver on our strategic goals the derivation and monitoring of successful strategies and related policies may be negatively impacted by the departure of key members of senior management moreover an inability to recruit and retain adequate numbers of experienced technical and professional personnel in the necessary locations may prohibit us from executing our strategy in full or in part with a commensurate impact on shareholder value 

we are dependent on oilfield service companies for items including drilling rigs equipment supplies and skilled labor an inability or significant delay in securing these services or a high cost thereof may result in material negative economic consequences the availability and cost of drilling rigs equipment supplies and skilled labor will fluctuate over time given the cyclical nature of the ep industry as a result we may encounter difficulties in obtaining required services or could face an increase in cost these consequences may impact our ability to run our operations and to deliver projects on time with the potential for material negative economic consequences 

we manage commodity price and other risks through our risk management function but such activities may impede our ability to benefit from commodity price increases and can expose us to similar potential counterparty credit risk as impacts amounts due from the sale of hydrocarbons we may enter into commodity price hedging arrangements to protect us from commodity price declines these arrangements may depending on the instruments used and the level of increases involved limit any potential upside from commodity price increases as with accounts receivable we may be exposed to potential economic loss should a counterparty be unable or unwilling to perform their obligations under the terms of a hedging agreement in addition we are exposed to risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency values and may engage in hedging activities to mitigate related volatility 

cyber‑attacks targeting computer telecommunications systems and infrastructure used by the oil and gas industry may materially impact our business and operations computers and telecommunication systems are used to conduct our exploration development and production activities and have become an integral part of our business we use these systems to analyze and store financial and operating data and to communicate within our company and with outside business partners cyber‑attacks could compromise our computer and telecommunications systems and result in disruptions to our business operations or the loss of our data and proprietary information in addition computers control oil and gas production processing equipment and distribution systems globally and are necessary to deliver our production to market a cyber‑attack against these operating systems or the networks and infrastructure on which they rely could damage critical production distribution andor storage assets delay or prevent delivery to markets and make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transactions as a result a cyberattack could have a material adverse impact on 

 

 

 

our cash flows and results of operations we routinely experience attempts by external parties to penetrate and attack our networks and systems although such attempts to date have not resulted in any material breaches disruptions or l oss of business critical information our systems and procedures for protecting against such attacks and mitigating such risks may prove to be insufficient in the future and such attacks could have an adverse impact on our business and operations in addi tion as technologies evolve and these attacks become more sophisticated we may incur significant costs to upgrade or enhance our security measures to protect against such attacks

 item 3 legal proceedings

we along with many companies that have been or continue to be engaged in refining and marketing of gasoline have been a party to lawsuits and claims related to the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe in gasoline a series of similar lawsuits many involving water utilities or governmental entities were filed in jurisdictions across the us against producers of mtbe and petroleum refiners who produced gasoline containing mtbe including us the principal allegation in all cases was that gasoline containing mtbe is a defective product and that these parties are strictly liable in proportion to their share of the gasoline market for damage to groundwater resources and are required to take remedial action to ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of releases of mtbe the majority of the cases asserted against us have been settled in june 2014 the commonwealth of pennsylvania and the state of vermont each filed independent lawsuits alleging that we and all major oil companies with operations in each respective state have damaged the groundwater in those states by introducing thereto gasoline with mtbe the pennsylvania suit has been removed to federal court and has been forwarded to the existing mtbe multidistrict litigation pending in the southern district of new york the suit filed in vermont is proceeding there in a state court in september 2016 the state of rhode island also filed a lawsuit in federal court alleging that we and other major oil companies damaged the groundwater in rhode island by introducing thereto gasoline with mtbe an action brought by the commonwealth of puerto rico was settled in conjunction with the bankruptcy court’s confirmation of hovensa’s liquidation plan which is described below the remaining open matters are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition

in september 2003 we received a directive from the new jersey department of environmental protection njdep to remediate contamination in the sediments of the lower passaic river the njdep is also seeking natural resource damages the directive insofar as it affects us relates to alleged releases from a petroleum bulk storage terminal in newark new jersey we previously owned we and over 70 companies entered into an administrative order on consent with the environmental protection agency epa to study the same contamination this work remains ongoing we and other parties settled a cost recovery claim by the state of new jersey and also agreed with epa to fund remediation of a portion of the site in april 2014 the epa issued a focused feasibility study ffs proposing to conduct banktobank dredging of the lower eight miles of the lower passaic river at an estimated cost of 17 billion on march 4 2016 the epa issued a record of decision rod in respect of the lower eight miles of the lower passaic river selecting a remedy that includes banktobank dredging at an estimated cost of 138 billion the rod does not address the upper nine miles of the lower passaic river which may require additional remedial action in addition the federal trustees for natural resources have begun a separate assessment of damages to natural resources in the passaic river given that the epa has not selected a remedy for the entirety of the lower passaic river total remedial costs cannot be reliably estimated at this time based on currently known facts and circumstances we do not believe that this matter will result in a significant liability to us because there are numerous other parties who we expect will share in the cost of remediation and damages and our former terminal did not store or use contaminants which are of the greatest concern in the river sediments and could not have contributed contamination along most of the river’s length 

in march 2014 we received an administrative order from epa requiring us and 26 other parties to undertake the remedial design for the remedy selected by the epa for the gowanus canal superfund site in brooklyn new york the remedy includes dredging of surface sediments and the placement of a cap over the deeper sediments throughout the canal and insitu stabilization of certain contaminated sediments that will remain in place below the cap epa has estimated that this remedy will cost 506 million however the ultimate costs that will be incurred in connection with the design and implementation of the remedy remain uncertain our alleged liability derives from our former ownership and operation of a fuel oil terminal adjacent to the canal we indicated to epa that we would comply with the administrative order and are currently contributing funding for the remedial design based on an interim allocation of costs among the parties at the same time we are participating in an allocation process whereby neutral experts selected by the parties will determine the final shares of the remedial design costs to be paid by each of the participants the parties have not yet addressed the allocation of costs associated with implementing the remedy that is currently being designed this matter is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition

 

 

 

on january 18 2017 we entered into a consent decree with the north dakota department of health resolving alleged nonco mpliance with north dakota’s air pollution laws and provisions of the federal clean air act pursuant to the consent decree we are required to implement corrective actions including implementation of a leak detection and repair program at most of our e xisting facilities in north dakota we were assessed a base penalty of 922000 which is subject to adjustment based on the date we complete corrective actions required under the terms of the consent decree we made an initial penalty payment of 55000 d uring the first quarter of 2017 

we periodically receive notices from the epa that we are a “potential responsible party” under the superfund legislation with respect to various waste disposal sites under this legislation all potentially responsible parties may be jointly and severally liable for certain sites such as those discussed above the epa’s claims or assertions of liability against us relating to these sites have not been fully developed with respect to the remaining sites the epa’s claims have been settled or a proposed settlement is under consideration in all cases for amounts that are not material the ultimate impact of these proceedings and of any related proceedings by private parties on our business or accounts cannot be predicted at this time due to the large number of other potentially responsible parties and the speculative nature of cleanup cost estimates but is not expected to be material

we are from time to time involved in other judicial and administrative proceedings including proceedings relating to other environmental matters we cannot predict with certainty if how or when such proceedings will be resolved or what the eventual relief if any may be particularly for proceedings that are in their early stages of development or where plaintiffs seek indeterminate damages numerous issues may need to be resolved including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters before a loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated for any proceeding subject to the foregoing in management’s opinion based upon currently known facts and circumstances the outcome of such proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

 i tem 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

hess corporation is a global exploration and production ep company engaged in exploration development production transportation purchase and sale of crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas with production operations located primarily in the united states us denmark equatorial guinea the malaysiathailand joint development area jda malaysia and norway the bakken midstream operating segment which was established in the second quarter of 2015 provides feebased services including gathering compressing and processing natural gas and fractionating natural gas liquids or ngls gathering terminaling loading and transporting crude oil and ngls and storing and terminaling propane primarily in the bakken and three forks shale plays in the williston basin area of north dakota

response to low oil prices

in 2016 our industry continued to face a challenging commodity price environment leading to further reductions in capital investment compared with 2015 our realized crude oil selling prices including hedging were 3920 per barrel in 2016 2015 4785 2014 9259 in response we improved operating efficiency across our portfolio and reduced our ep capital and exploratory expenditures during 2016 to 19 billion a decrease of over 50 compared to the same period in 2015 which partially contributed to our lower 2016 oil and gas production levels 

in addition to improving our operating efficiency and reducing our capital and exploratory expenditures we proactively took other steps in 2016 to preserve the strength of our balance sheet and improve liquidity including issuing equity securities and executing a debt refinancing transaction in february 2016 we issued 28750000 shares of common stock and depositary shares representing 575000 shares of 8 series a mandatory convertible preferred stock for total net proceeds of 16 billion in the third quarter of 2016 we initiated a debt refinancing transaction by issuing 1 billion of 430 notes due in 2027 and 500 million of 580 notes due in 2047 with proceeds used primarily to purchase highercoupon bonds and redeem nearterm maturities at december 31 2016 we had 27 billion in cash and cash equivalents and total liquidity including available committed credit facilities of approximately 73 billion

we project our ep capital and exploratory expenditures will be approximately 225 billion in 2017 as we plan to increase from two rigs to six rigs in the bakken over the course of 2017 capital expenditures for our midstream operations are expected to be approximately 190 million oil and gas production in 2017 is forecast to be in the range of 300000 boepd to 310000 boepd excluding any contribution from libya as a result of reduced capital expenditures in 2016 and a high level of planned maintenance in the second quarter of 2017 we forecast our production to decline during the first half of 2017 and then increase in the third and fourth quarters of the year with the startup of north malay basin and a new well at the penn state field in the gulf of mexico expected in the third quarter and production increases as a result of the rig ramp up in the bakken

in 2016 we realized a net operating cash flow deficit cash flow from operating activities less cash flows from investing activities of 1295 million forward strip crude oil prices for 2017 are higher than average prices for 2016 and as a result we forecast a smaller net operating cash flow deficit in 2017 we expect to fund our net operating cash flow deficit including capital expenditures for the full year of 2017 with cash on hand due to the low commodity price environment we may take any of the following steps or a combination thereof to improve our liquidity and financial position reduce our planned capital program and other cash outlays borrow from our committed credit facilities issue debt or equity securities and pursue asset sales

consolidated results

net loss attributable to hess corporation was 6132 million in 2016 and 3056 million in 2015 in 2014 net income attributable to hess corporation was 2317 million excluding items affecting comparability summarized on page 27 the adjusted net loss was 1489 million in 2016 and 1113 million in 2015 adjusted net income in 2014 was 1308 million annual production averaged 322000 boepd in 2016 375000 boepd in 2015 and 329000 boepd in 2014 total proved reserves were 1109 million boe 1086 million boe and 1431 million boe at december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively lower crude oil prices in 2015 resulted in negative revisions of 234 million boe at december 31 2015 primarily related to proved undeveloped reserves

in 2016 the operator also drilled the payara1 exploration well at the payara prospect located approximately 10 miles northwest of the liza discovery and encountered more than 95 feet of oilbearing sandstone reservoirs at the skipjack prospect 25 miles northwest of the liza discovery the operator completed the drilling of an exploration well which was unsuccessful and expensed in 2017 the operator plans to drill a well at the snoek exploration prospect a liza4 appraisal well and a payara2 appraisal well in addition the operator will evaluate additional exploration opportunities on the broader stabroek block









the following is an update of significant bakken midstream activities during 2016



 

 

liquidity and capital and exploratory expenditures 

net cash provided by operating activities was 795 million in 2016 2015 1981 million 2014 4457 million at december 31 2016 cash and cash equivalents were 2732 million 2015 2716 million and total debt was 6806 million 2015 6592 million our consolidated debt to capitalization ratio at december 31 2016 was 304 2015 244

capital and exploratory expenditures from continuing operations were as follows in millions



exploration expenses charged to income included in ep capital and exploratory expenditures above were







we plan to invest approximately 225 billion on ep capital and exploratory expenditures and approximately 190 million in midstream capital expenditures in 2017 beginning january 1 2017 hess’s midstream segment will include our interest in a permian gas plant in west texas and related co 2 assets and water handling assets in north dakota  these assets are wholly owned by the corporation and are not included in our hess infrastructure partners joint venture

 

 

consolidated results of operations 

the aftertax income loss by major operating activity is summarized below





the following table summarizes on an aftertax basis items of income expense that are included in net income loss and affect comparability between periods the items in the table below are explained on pages 32 through 36

items affecting comparability of earnings between periods



in the following discussion and elsewhere in this report the financial effects of certain transactions are disclosed on an aftertax basis management reviews segment earnings on an aftertax basis and uses after‑tax amounts in its review of variances in segment earnings management believes that aftertax amounts are a preferable method of explaining variances in earnings since they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only the pretax amount aftertax amounts are determined by applying the income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pretax amounts

the following table reconciles reported net income loss attributable to hess corporation and adjusted net income loss



“adjusted net income loss” presented in this report is a nongaap financial measure which we define as reported net income loss attributable to hess corporation excluding items identified as affecting comparability of earnings between periods management uses adjusted net income loss to evaluate the corporation’s operating performance and believes that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this measure which excludes certain items that management believes are not directly related to ongoing operations and are not indicative of future business trends and operations this measure is not and should not be viewed as a substitute for us gaap net income loss

 

 

 

 

comparison of r esults 

exploration and production

following is a summarized income statement of our ep operations



excluding the ep items affecting comparability of earnings between periods in the table on page 32 the changes in ep earnings are primarily attributable to changes in selling prices production and sales volumes cost of products sold cash operating costs depreciation depletion and amortization bakken midstream tariffs exploration expenses and income taxes as discussed below

 

 

selling prices average realized crude oil selling prices including hedgi ng were 18 lower in 2016 compared to the prior year primarily due to the declines in brent and wti crude oil prices in addition realized selling prices for natural gas liquids and natural gas declined in 2016 by 5 and 19 respectively compared to the prior year in total lower realized selling prices reduced 2016 financial results by approximately 440 million after income taxes compared with 2015 our average selling prices were as follows 



crude oil price hedging contracts increased ep sales and other operating revenues by 126 million 79 million after income taxes in 2015 and 193 million 121 million after income taxes in 2014 there were no crude oil hedge contracts in 2016 

 

 

production volumes our net daily worldwide production was as follows 



we expect total net production to average between 300000 boepd and 310000 boepd in 2017 excluding any contribution from libya our production has been decreasing the last several quarters as a result of reducing our capital expenditures to manage in the lower price environment we expect our production will continue to decline in the first half of 2017 as a result of this reduced spend and a high level of planned maintenance at four of our offshore assets in the second quarter we forecast production to average between 290000 boepd and 300000 boepd in the first quarter and between 270000 boepd and 280000 boepd in the second quarter production is then forecast to increase in the third quarter with the startup of north malay basin and a new well at the penn state field in the gulf of mexico to between 305000 boepd and 315000 boepd we expect our production will continue to grow in the fourth quarter as bakken production increases as a result of the rig ramp up and the first new valhall well comes online fourth quarter production is forecast to average between 330000 boepd and 340000 boepd

production variances related to 2016 2015 and 2014 can be summarized as follows

united states onshore crude oil production was lower in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to reduced drilling activity in the bakken shale play in response to low oil prices while the increase in natural gas liquids production was primarily due to greater processed volumes at the tioga gas plant onshore natural gas production was higher in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to a higher number of wells being on production in the utica shale play relative to the prior year total offshore production was lower in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to subsurface valve failures in three wells at the tubular bells field a shutin well to replace a subsurface valve at the conger field extended planned shutdowns 

 

 

on thirdp arty hosted production facilities at the tubular bells and conger fields and natural field decline onshore crude oil and natural gas liquids production was higher in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to continued drilling in the bakken oil shale play  while the increase in natural gas production was primarily attributable to the bakken and the utica shale offshore production increased in 2015 relative to 2014 as higher production from the tubular bells field which came online in november 2014 was offset primarily by lower production from the llano conger and shenzi fields 

europe crude oil production was lower in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to lower drilling activity natural field decline and a planned shutdown at the valhall field offshore norway crude oil and natural gas production was higher in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to less facility downtime and new wells at the valhall field in 2015 

africa crude oil production in africa was lower in 2016 compared to 2015 as a result of reduced drilling activity in equatorial guinea and the sale of our algeria asset in the fourth quarter of 2015 where net production for 2015 amounted to 7000 boepd  crude oil production in africa was lower in 2015 compared to 2014 due to libyan production being shutin force majeure declared by the national oil company of libya was lifted in september 2016 and net production averaged 1000 boepd in 2016 

asia   natural gas production was lower in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to the planned shutdown of production facilities at the jda in 2016 to commission the booster compressor project and from lower production entitlement natural gas production was lower in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to asset sales partially offset by higher production at the jda as a result of higher facility uptime 

sales volumes the impact of lower sales volumes decreased aftertax results by approximately 540 million in 2016 compared to 2015 o ur worldwide sales volumes were as follows 



cost of products sold cost of products sold is mainly comprised of costs relating to the purchases of crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas from our partners in hess operated wells or other thirdparties as well as rail transportation fees from our bakken midstream operating segment the decrease in cost of products sold in 2016 compared to 2015 and in 2015 compared to 2014 principally reflects the decline in crude oil prices 

cash operating costs   cash operating costs consisting of operating costs and expenses production and severance taxes and ep general and administrative expenses decreased by 194 million in 2016 compared with the prior year 2015 188 million decrease versus 2014 the decrease in 2016 compared to 2015 is due to l ower production and ongoing cost reduction efforts and lower production taxes in the bakken operating costs in 2016 include higher workover costs to replace failed subsurface valves in the gulf of mexico the decrease in 2015 compared to 2014 is due to cost reductions across the portfolio and lower production taxes in the bakken which were partially offset by higher operating costs at tubular bells where production commenced in the fourth quarter of 2014  

bakken midstream tariffs expense tariffs expense in 2016 increased versus 2015 primarily due to increased oil gathering tariffs and minimum volume deficiency payments related to rail export services in 2016 partially offset by lower gas volumes processed through the tioga gas plant higher tariff expense in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily reflects higher volumes processed through the tioga gas plant which was shut down during the first quarter of 2014 to complete a plant expansion and refurbishment project for 2017 we estimate midstream tariffs expense which will include tariffs associated with our interests in a permian gas plant in west texas and related co 2 assets and water handling assets in north dakota to be in the range of 520 million to 550 million 

depreciation depletion and amortization depreciation depletion and amortization dda costs decreased by 720 million in 2016 from 2015 the decrease resulted from lower production and an improved portfolio average dda rate due to the production mix  higher production in 2015 from the bakken tubular bells and utica fields which had higher dda rates per barrel than the portfolio average were the primarily drivers for the increase in dda costs in 2015 compared to 2014  

 

 

unit costs unit cost per boe in formation is based on total ep production volumes and exclude items affecting comparability of earnings as disclosed below actual and forecast unit costs are as follows 





exploration expenses   exploration expenses including items affecting comparability of earnings described below were as follows 



exploration expenses were higher in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to higher dry hole expense partially offset by lower leasehold impairment expense geologic and seismic costs and employee expenses exploration expenses were higher in 2015 compared to 2014 due to higher dry hole costs partially offset by lower leasehold impairment expense geologic and seismic costs and employee expenses see items affecting comparability of earnings between periods described below for 2017 we estimate exploration expenses excluding dry hole expense to be in the range of 250 million to 270 million 

income taxes the ep income tax provision was an expense of 1588 million in 2016 a benefit of 1111 million in 2015 and an expense of 989 million in 2014 the income tax expense recognized in 2016 despite pretax losses is the result of deferred income tax charges to establish valuation allowances on net deferred tax assets excluding the impact of these charges and other items affecting comparability of earnings between periods provided below and libya the effective income tax rates for ep operations amounted to a benefit of 42 in 2016 2015 46 benefit 2014 37 charge based on current strip crude oil prices we are forecasting a pretax loss for 2017 the ep effective tax rate excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods and libyan operations is expected to be a benefit in the range of 17 to 21 which is lower than the comparable effective tax rate in 2016 due to our not recognizing a deferred tax benefit or expense commencing in 2017 in the us denmark hydrocarbon tax only and malaysia until such time that deferred tax assets are reestablished in these jurisdictions see ep items affecting comparability of earnings below and critical accounting policies and estimates – income taxes on page 42

bakken midstream

following is a summarized income statement of our bakken midstream operations





total revenues and nonoperating income in 2016 decreased from 2015 primarily as a result of lower rail export revenue associated with thirdparty rail charges partially offset by recognition of deferred minimum volume deficiency payments earned  total revenues and nonoperating income in 2015 improved from 2014 mainly due to higher throughput volumes at the tioga gas plant 

 

 

operating costs and expenses were lower in 2016 compared to 2015 p rimarily due to a decrease in thirdparty rail charges  operating costs and expenses were higher in 2015 compared to 2014 mainly due to an increase in third ‑party oper ating and maintenance expense dda expenses were higher in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to c apital expenditures on gathering pipelines and railcars that were placed in service  dda expenses were higher in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily due to a full year’s usage of the tioga gas plant in 2015 which was shut down during the first quarter of 2014 in connection with a largescale expansion refurbishment and optimization project 

the increase in interest expense in 2016 and 2015 reflects borrowings by hess infrastructure partners lp subsequent to its formation on july 1 2015

for 2017 we estimate net income attributable to hess corporation from the midstream segment excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods to be in the range of 70 million to 90 million in 2017 the midstream segment will include our interests in a permian gas plant in west texas and related co 2 assets and water handling assets in north dakota in addition to assets that comprise our current bakken midstream segment

items affecting comparability of earnings between periods bakken midstream 2016 results included a pretax charge of 67 million 21 million after income taxes and noncontrolling interest to impair older specification rail cars 

corporate interest and other

the following table summarizes corporate interest and other expenses



corporate and other expenses excluding items affecting comparability were lower in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to reductions in employee costs professional fees and other general and administrative expenses and the benefit of higher interest income and nonoperating income corporate and other expenses for 2014 include a pretax gain of 13 million 8 million after income taxes related to the disposition of our 50 interest in a joint venture involved in the construction of an electric generating facility in newark new jersey excluding the gain 2015 costs are down compared to 2014 primarily due to lower employee costs and other expenses in 2017 pretax corporate expenses excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods are estimated to be in the range of 140 million to 150 million 

interest expense was comparable in 2016 compared to 2015 but capitalized interest expense increased over the same period with 2016 reflecting increased activity at the hess operated stampede development project interest expense was lower in 2015 compared to 2014 as lower interest rates offset higher average borrowings capitalized interest was also lower in 2015 compared to 2014 due to the cessation of capitalized interest on the tubular bells field upon first production in the fourth quarter of 2014 in 2017 pretax interest expense net is estimated to be in the range of 295 million to 305 million

discontinued operations – items affecting comparability of earnings between periods

discontinued operations attributable to hess corporation incurred a net loss of 48 million in 2015 compared to a net income of 625 million in 2014 discontinued operations included ownership of an energy trading partnership through february 2015 and retail marketing through september 2014

in september 2014 we completed the sale of our retail business for cash proceeds of approximately 28 billion this transaction resulted in a pretax gain of 954 million 602 million after income taxes during 2014 we recorded pretax gains of 275 million 171 million after income taxes relating to the liquidation of lastin firstout lifo inventories associated with the divested downstream operations in addition we recorded pretax charges totaling 308 million 202 million after income taxes in 2014 for impairments environmental matters severance and exit related activities associated with the divestiture of downstream operations we also recognized in 2014 a pretax charge of 115 million 72 million after income taxes related to the termination of lease contracts and the purchase of 180 retail gasoline stations in preparation for the sale of the retail operations

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table sets forth certain relevant measures of our liquidity and capital resources at december 31







 

 

cash flows 

the following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows



operating activities  net cash provided by operating activities was 795 million in 2016 1981 million in 2015 and 4457 million in 2014 primarily reflecting declining benchmark crude oil prices and changes in production volumes 

investing activities   the decrease in additions to property plant and equipment in 2016 as compared to 2015 is primarily due to reduced drilling activity bakken utica norway denmark and equatorial guinea and reduced development expenditures tubular bells north malay basin and the jda the decrease in additions to property plant and equipment in 2015 as compared to 2014 is primarily due to reduced drilling activity bakken utica norway and equatorial guinea reduced development expenditures at tubular bells and the jda and lower exploratory drilling activity ghana and kurdistan these reductions were offset by 2015 activity related to development activities at stampede in the gulf of mexico and exploration drilling activity in the gulf of mexico and guyana and full field development at north malay basin 

total proceeds from the sale of assets related to continuing operations amounted to 140 million in 2016 2015 50 million 2014 2978 million in 2014 we completed asset sales of our dry gas acreage in the utica shale play our assets in thailand the pangkah field offshore indonesia and our interests in two power plant joint ventures in 2014 net cash provided by investing activities from discontinued operations included proceeds of 28 billion from the sale of the retail business in addition we acquired our partners’ 56 interest in wilcohess a retail gasoline joint venture for approximately 290 million and we incurred capital expenditures of 105 million related to the acquisition of previously leased retail gasoline stations 

financing activities in 2016 total borrowings were 154 billion and total repayments of debt were 146 billion in the first quarter of 2016 we issued 28750000 shares of common stock and depositary shares representing 575000 shares of 8 series a mandatory convertible preferred stock for total net proceeds of 164 billion  in 2015 we received net cash consideration of approximately 26 billion from the sale of a 50 interest in our bakken midstream business upon formation of the joint venture hip issued 600 million of debt under a term loan a facility the proceeds from the debt were distributed equally to the partners we purchased common stock under our 65 billion board authorized stock repurchase plan of 142 million in 2015 and 3715 million in 2014 common and preferred stock dividends paid were 350 million in 2016 2015 287 million 2014 303 million 

 

 

future capital requiremen ts and resources 

at december 31 2016 we had 27 billion in cash and cash equivalents and total liquidity including available committed credit facilities of approximately 73 billion cash and cash equivalents held outside of the us which we have the ability to repatriate without triggering a us cash tax liability amounted to 287 million at december 31 2016  

net production in 2017 is forecast to be in the range of 300000 boepd to 310000 boepd excluding any contribution from libya and we expect our 2017 ep capital and exploratory expenditures will be approximately 225 billion  based on current forward strip crude oil prices for 2017 which are higher than 2016 prices we forecast a smaller net loss and net operating cash flow deficit including capital expenditures in 2017 compared to 2016 we expect to fund our projected net operating cash flow deficit including capital expenditures through 2017 with cash on hand due to the low commodity price environment we may take any of the following steps or a combination thereof to improve our liquidity and financial position further reduce our planned capital program and other cash outlays borrow from our committed credit facilities issue debt or equity securities and pursue asset sales

the table below summarizes the capacity usage and available capacity of our borrowing and letter of credit facilities at december 31 2016







hess corporation has a 40 billion syndicated revolving credit facility expiring in january 2020 borrowings on the facility will generally bear interest at 13 above the london interbank offered rate libor the interest rate will be higher if our credit rating is lowered the facility contains a financial covenant that limits the amount of the total borrowings on the last day of each fiscal quarter to 65 of the corporation’s total capitalization defined as total debt plus stockholders’ equity as of december 31 2016 hess corporation had no outstanding borrowings under this facility and was in compliance with this financial covenant 

we had 188 million in letters of credit outstanding at december 31 2016 2015 113 million which primarily relate to our international operations see also note 24 financial risk management activities in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

hip has a 400 million 5year syndicated revolving credit facility which can be used for borrowings and letters of credit to fund the joint venture’s operating activities and capital expenditures borrowings generally bear interest at the libor plus an applicable margin ranging from 110 to 170 the interest rate is subject to adjustment based on hip’s leverage ratio which is calculated as total debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda if hip obtains credit ratings pricing levels will be based on the credit ratings in effect from time to time the credit facility contains financial covenants that generally require a leverage ratio of no more than 50 to 10 for the prior four fiscal quarters and an interest coverage ratio which is calculated as ebitda to interest expense of no less than 225 to 10 for the prior four fiscal quarters hip is in compliance with these financial covenants at december 31 2016 

at december 31 2016 borrowings under hip’s revolving credit facility which are nonrecourse to hess corporation amounted to 153 million hip also has a fiveyear term loan a loan facility with outstanding borrowings of 585 million excluding deferred issuance costs which is also nonrecourse to hess corporation

we also have a shelf registration under which we may issue additional debt securities warrants common stock or preferred stock

 

 

credit ratings 

two of the three major credit rating agencies that rate our debt have assigned an investment grade rating in february 2016 standard and poor’s ratings services sp lowered our investment grade credit rating one notch to bbb with stable outlook and moody’s investors service moody’s lowered our credit rating to ba1 with stable outlook which is below investment grade in december 2016 fitch ratings fitch lowered our investment grade credit rating one notch to bbb with stable outlook in february 2017 sp reaffirmed our investment grade credit rating of bbb with stable outlook the consequence of lower credit ratings is an increase in interest rates and facility fees on our credit facilities and the potential for additional required collateral under operating agreements as of december 31 2016 based on our current credit ratings we may be required to issue additional collateral in the form of letters of credit up to approximately 270 million if fitch or sp were to reduce their rating on our unsecured debt below investment grade we estimate that we could be required to issue additional letters of credit up to 200 million as of december 31 2016

contractual obligations and contingencies

the following table shows aggregate information about certain contractual obligations at december 31 2016





capital expenditures represent amounts that were contractually committed at december 31 2016 including the portion of our planned capital expenditure program for 2017 obligations for operating expenses include commitments for oil and gas production expenses seismic purchases and other normal business expenses other liabilities reflect contractually committed obligations in the consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2016 including pension plan liabilities and estimates for uncertain income tax positions

the corporation and certain of its subsidiaries lease drilling rigs office space and other assets for varying periods under leases accounted for as operating leases

offbalance sheet arrangements

at december 31 2016 we have 27 million in letters of credit for which we are contingently liable see also note 21 guarantees contingencies and commitments in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

foreign operations

we conduct exploration and production activities outside the us principally in europe norway and denmark africa equatorial guinea libya and ghana asia joint development area of malaysiathailand and malaysia australia south america guyana and suriname and canada therefore we are subject to the risks associated with foreign operations including political risk corruption acts of terrorism tax law changes and currency risk see item 1a risk factors for further details

 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

accounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and revenues and expenses in the statement of consolidated income  the accounting methods used can affect net income equity and various financial statement ratios however our accounting policies generally do not change cash flows or liquidity

accounting for exploration and development costs ep activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage including lease bonuses brokers’ fees and other related costs are capitalized annual lease rentals exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred costs of drilling and equipping productive wells including development dry holes and related production facilities are capitalized in production operations costs of injected co 2 for tertiary recovery are expensed as incurred 

the costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if 1 the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and 2 sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operational viability of the project if either of those criteria is not met or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project the capitalized well costs are charged to expense indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves and the economic and operating viability of a project include commitment of project personnel active negotiations for sales contracts with customers negotiations with governments operators and contractors and firm plans for additional drilling and other factors

crude oil and natural gas reserves the determination of estimated proved reserves is a significant element in arriving at the results of operations of exploration and production activities the estimates of proved reserves affect well capitalizations the unit of production depreciation rates of proved properties and wells and equipment as well as impairment testing of oil and gas assets and goodwill 

for reserves to be booked as proved they must be determined with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations in addition government and project operator approvals must be obtained and depending on the amount of the project cost senior management or the board of directors must commit to fund the project we maintain our own internal reserve estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work directly with the oil and gas properties our technical staff updates reserve estimates throughout the year based on evaluations of new wells performance reviews new technical data and other studies to provide consistency throughout the corporation standard reserve estimation guidelines definitions reporting reviews and approval practices are used the internal reserve estimates are subject to internal technical audits and senior management review we also engage an independent thirdparty consulting firm to audit approximately 80 of our total proved reserves each year

proved reserves are calculated using the average price during the twelvemonth period ending december 31 determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the price on the first day of each month within the year unless prices are defined by contractual agreements excluding escalations based on future conditions as discussed in item 1a risk factors  crude oil prices are volatile which can have an impact on our proved reserves for example the average wti crude oil price used in the determination of proved reserves at december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 was 4268 5013 and 9442 per barrel respectively the lower prices for 2016 and 2015 relative to 2014 resulted in negative revisions to our proved reserves at december 31 2016 of 29 million boe 2015 234 million boe if crude oil prices in 2017 are at levels below that used in determining 2016 proved reserves we may recognize further negative revisions to our december 31 2016 proved undeveloped reserves in addition we may recognize negative revisions to proved developed reserves which can vary significantly by asset due to differing operating cost structures conversely price increases in 2017 above those used in determining 2016 proved reserves could result in positive revisions to proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves at december 31 2017 it is difficult to estimate the magnitude of any potential net negative or positive change in proved reserves as of december 31 2017 due to a number of factors that are currently unknown including 2017 crude oil prices any revisions based on 2017 reservoir performance and the levels to which industry costs will change in response to movements in commodity prices a 10 change in proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves at december 31 2016 would result in an approximate 300 million pretax change in depreciation depletion and amortization expense for 2017 see the supplementary oil and gas data on pages 84 through 94 in the accompanying financial statements for additional information on our oil and gas reserves

bakken midstream joint venture on july 1 2015 we sold a 50 interest in hip to gip for net cash consideration of approximately 26 billion we consolidate the activities of hip which qualifies as a variable interest entity vie under us generally accepted accounting principles we have concluded that we are the primary beneficiary of the vie as defined in the accounting standards since we have the power through our 50 ownership to direct those activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of hip and are obligated to absorb losses or have the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to hip this conclusion was based on a qualitative analysis that considered hip’s 

 

 

governance structure the commercial agreements between hip and us and the voting rights establ ished between the members which provide us the ability to control the operations of hip 

impairment of longlived assets we review long‑lived assets including oil and gas fields for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered long‑lived assets are tested based on identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities if the carrying amounts of the longlived assets are not expected to be recovered by estimated undiscounted future net cash flows the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded the amount of impairment is determined based on the estimated fair value of the assets generally determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows an income valuation approach or by a market‑based valuation approach which are level 3 fair value measurements 

in the case of oil and gas fields the present value of future net cash flows is based on management’s best estimate of future prices which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices applied to projected production volumes and discounted at a riskadjusted rate the projected production volumes represent reserves including probable reserves expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures the production volumes prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairments will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows since the standardized measure requires the use of historical twelvemonth average prices 

our impairment tests of long‑lived ep producing assets are based on our best estimates of future production volumes including recovery factors selling prices operating and capital costs the timing of future production and other factors which are updated each time an impairment test is performed we could have impairments if the projected production volumes from oil and gas fields decrease crude oil and natural gas selling prices decline significantly for an extended period or future estimated capital and operating costs increase significantly as a result of the extended period of low crude oil prices we tested our oil and gas properties for impairment see note 6 impairment in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

impairment of goodwill goodwill is tested for impairment annually on october 1 st or when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable based on a twostep process the goodwill test is conducted at a reporting unit level which is defined in accounting standards as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment the reporting unit or units to be used in an evaluation and measurement of goodwill for impairment testing are determined from a number of factors including the manner in which the business is managed prior to the second quarter of 2015 we had one operating segment ep consisting of two reporting units offshore and onshore which reflected the manner in which performance was assessed by the operating segment manager in the second quarter of 2015 we established a second operating segment bakken midstream which previously was part of the onshore reporting unit prior to the formation of the bakken midstream operating segment the offshore reporting unit had allocated goodwill of 1098 million while the onshore reporting unit had allocated goodwill of 760 million upon formation of the bakken midstream operating segment we allocated 375 million of goodwill from the onshore reporting unit to the bakken midstream operating segment based on the relative fair values of the bakken midstream business and the remainder of the onshore reporting unit there was no change to the composition of the offshore reporting unit 

in step one of the impairment test the fair value of a reporting unit is compared with its carrying amount including goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill is not impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value we perform step two to determine possible impairment by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by assuming the reporting unit is purchased at fair value with assets and liabilities of the reporting unit being reflected at fair value in the same manner as the accounting prescribed for a business combination the resulting excess of fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to the reporting unit’s assets and liabilities represents the implied fair value of goodwill if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying amount an impairment loss would be recorded

our fair value estimate of each reporting unit is the sum of the anticipated discounted cash flows of producing assets and known development projects and an estimated market premium to reflect the market price an acquirer would pay for potential synergies including cost savings access to new business opportunities enterprise control and increased market share the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit depends on estimates about oil and gas reserves future prices timing of future net cash flows and market premiums we also consider the relative market valuation of similar peer companies and other market data if available in determining fair value of a reporting unit in addition a qualitative reconciliation of our market capitalization to the fair value of the reporting units used in the goodwill impairment test is performed as of the testing date to assess reasonableness of the reporting unit fair values 

significant extended declines in crude oil and natural gas prices or reduced reserve estimates could lead to a decrease in the fair value of a reporting unit that could result in failing step one and potentially result in an impairment of goodwill based on the outcome of step two if a reporting unit fails step one it is possible that the implied fair value of goodwill in step two exceeds its carrying value due to one or more assets of the reporting unit having a fair value below its carrying value

 

 

as there are significant differences in the way longlived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing there may be impairments of individual assets that woul d not cause an impairment of the goodwill assigned at the reporting unit level or there could be an impairment of goodwill without a corresponding impairment of an underlying asset 

in the second quarter of 2015 we performed impairment tests on the offshore and onshore reporting units in accordance with accounting standards for goodwill immediately prior to creation of the bakken midstream operating segment no impairment resulted from this assessment in addition accounting standards require that following a reorganization allocated goodwill should be tested for impairment we also performed impairment tests on the allocated goodwill for the bakken midstream and the onshore reporting unit at june 30 2015 goodwill allocated to the bakken midstream operating segment passed the impairment test but the goodwill allocated to the onshore reporting unit did not pass the impairment test as a result we recorded a noncash pretax charge of 385 million 385 million after income taxes in the second quarter of 2015 to reflect the onshore reporting unit’s goodwill at its implied fair value of zero based on a hypothetical purchase price allocation as stipulated in the accounting standards 

as a result of the decline in crude oil prices in the fourth quarter of 2015 we performed an impairment test at december 31 2015 on the offshore reporting unit and determined its goodwill was impaired we recorded a pretax impairment charge of 1098 million 1098 million after income taxes to reflect the offshore reporting unit’s goodwill at its implied fair value of zero based on a hypothetical purchase price allocation as stipulated in the accounting standards 

effective january 1 2017 as part of a reorganization of our ep business the onshore and offshore reporting units were combined within the ep operating segment which had no goodwill at december 31 2016 this reorganization had no impact on the composition of the bakken midstream operating segment we expect that the benefits of our remaining goodwill totaling 375 million assigned to the bakken midstream operating segment will be recovered based on market conditions at december 31 2016

income taxes judgments are required in the determination and recognition of income tax assets and liabilities in the financial statements these judgments include the requirement to only recognize the financial statement effect of a tax position when management believes that it is more likely than not that based on the technical merits the position will be sustained upon examination 

we have net operating loss carryforwards or credit carryforwards in multiple jurisdictions and have recorded deferred tax assets for those losses and credits additionally we have deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized if when tested under the relevant accounting standards it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized 

the accounting standards require the evaluation of all available positive and negative evidence giving weight based on the evidence’s relative objectivity in evaluating potential sources of positive evidence we consider the reversal of taxable temporary differences taxable income in carryback and carryforward periods the availability of tax planning strategies the existence of appreciated assets estimates of future taxable income and other factors estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas reserves selling prices and other subjective operating assumptions that are consistent with internal business forecasts in evaluating potential sources of negative evidence we consider a cumulative loss in recent years any history of operating losses or tax credit carryforwards expiring unused losses expected in early future years unsettled circumstances that if unfavorably resolved would adversely affect future operations and profit levels on a continuing basis in future years and carryback or carryforward periods that are so brief that it would limit realization of tax benefits if a significant deductible temporary difference is expected to reverse in a single year due to a sustained low commodity price environment we experienced a threeyear cumulative consolidated loss as of december 31 2016 a threeyear cumulative consolidated loss constitutes objective negative evidence to which the accounting standards require we assign significant weight relative to subjective evidence such as our estimates of future taxable income 

as of december 31 2016 the consolidated balance sheet reflects a 5450 million valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets for multiple jurisdictions based on the evaluation of the accounting standards described above with 3749 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016 related primarily to the us denmark hydrocarbon tax only and malaysia the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable however could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income change or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight is given to subjective evidence such as expected future growth we do not provide for deferred us income taxes for that portion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations

asset retirement obligations we have material legal obligations to remove and dismantle long‑lived assets and to restore land or seabed at certain exploration and production locations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we recognize a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations in addition the fair value of any 

 

 

legally required conditional asset retirement obligation is recorded if the lia bility can be reasonably estimated we capitalize such costs as a component of the carrying amount of the underlying assets in the period in which the liability is incurred in subsequent periods the liability is accreted and the asset is depreciated o ver the useful life of the related asset in order to measure these obligations we estimate the fair value of the obligations by discounting the future payments that will be required to satisfy the obligations in determining these estimates we are req uired to make several assumptions and judgments related to the scope of dismantlement timing of settlement interpretation of legal requirements inflationary factors and discount rate in addition there are other external factors which could significan tly affect the ultimate settlement costs for these obligations including changes in environmental regulations and other statutory requirements fluctuations in industry costs and foreign currency exchange rates and advances in technology as a result our estimates of asset retirement obligations are subject to revision due to the factors described above changes in estimates prior to settlement result in adjustments to both the liability and related asset values 

retirement plans we have funded noncontributory defined benefit pension plans an unfunded supplemental pension plan and an unfunded postretirement medical plan we recognize the net change in the funded status of the projected benefit obligation for these plans in the consolidated balance sheet  

the determination of the obligations and expenses related to these plans are based on several actuarial assumptions the most significant of which relate to the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations expected long‑term rates of return on plan assets the rate of future increases in compensation levels and participant mortality assumptions these assumptions represent estimates made by us some of which can be affected by external factors for example the discount rate used to estimate our projected benefit obligation is based on a portfolio of high‑quality fixed income debt instruments with maturities that approximate the expected payment of plan obligations while the expected return on plan assets is developed from the expected future returns for each asset category weighted by the target allocation of pension assets to that asset category changes in these assumptions can have a material impact on the amounts reported in our financial statements

derivatives we utilize derivative instruments including futures forwards options and swaps individually or in combination to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in the prices of crude oil and natural gas as well as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates 

all derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet  our policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative the changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized currently in earnings derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions cash flow hedges or hedges of firm commitments fair value hedges the effective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income loss amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings the ineffective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recorded currently in earnings changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings the change in fair value of the related hedged commitment is recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized currently in earnings

fair value measurements we use various valuation approaches in determining fair value for financial instruments including the market and income approaches our fair value measurements also include nonperformance risk and time value of money considerations counterparty credit is considered for receivable balances and our credit is considered for accrued liabilities 

we also record certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value when required by generally accepted accounting principles these fair value measurements are recorded in connection with business combinations qualifying nonmonetary exchanges the initial recognition of asset retirement obligations and any impairment of longlived assets equity method investments or goodwill

we determine fair value in accordance with the fair value measurements accounting standard which established a hierarchy for the inputs used to measure fair value based on the source of the inputs which generally range from quoted prices for identical instruments in a principal trading market level 1 to estimates determined using related market data level 3 including discounted cash flows and other unobservable data  measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered level 2

when level 1 inputs are available within a particular market those inputs are selected for determination of fair value over level 2 or 3 inputs in the same market multiple inputs may be used to measure fair value however the level of fair value for each physical derivative and financial asset or liability is based on the lowest significant input level within this fair value hierarchy 

 

 

environment health and safety 

our long term vision and values provide a foundation for how we do business and define our commitment to meeting high standards of corporate citizenship and creating a long lasting positive impact on the communities where we do business our strategy is reflected in our environment health safety and social responsibility ehs  sr policies and by a management system framework that helps protect our workforce customers and local communities our management systems are intended to promote internal consistency adherence to policy objectives and continual improvement in ehs  sr performance improved performance may in the short‑term increase our operating costs and could also require increased capital expenditures to reduce potential risks to assets reputation and license to operate in addition to enhanced ehs  sr performance improved productivity and operational efficiencies may be realized from investments in ehs  sr we have programs in place to evaluate regulatory compliance audit facilities train employees prevent and manage risks and emergencies and to generally meet corporate ehs  sr goals and objectives

we recognize that climate change is a global environmental concern we assess monitor and take measures to reduce our carbon footprint at existing and planned operations we are committed to complying with all greenhouse gas ghg emissions mandates and the responsible management of ghg emissions at our facilities

we will have continuing expenditures for environmental assessment and remediation sites where corrective action may be necessary include onshore exploration and production facilities sites from discontinued operations as to which we retained liability and although not currently significant “superfund” sites where we have been named a potentially responsible party

we accrue for environmental assessment and remediation expenses when the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable at december 31 2016 our reserve for estimated remediation liabilities was approximately 80 million we expect that existing reserves for environmental liabilities will adequately cover costs to assess and remediate known sites our remediation spending was approximately 10 million in 2016 2015 13 million 2014 12 million the level of other expenditures to comply with federal state local and foreign country environmental regulations is difficult to quantify as such costs are captured as mostly indistinguishable components of our capital expenditures and operating expenses

 

 




 ite m 7a quantitative and qualitative d isclosures about market risk 

as discussed in note 24  financial risk management activities  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  in the normal course of our business we are exposed to commodity risks related to changes in the prices of crude oil and natural gas as well as changes in interest rates and foreign currency values in the disclosures that follow financial risk management activities refer to the mitigation of these risks through hedging activities

controls we maintain a control environment under the direction of our chief risk officer controls over instruments used in financial risk management activities include volumetric and term limits our treasury department is responsible for administering and monitoring foreign exchange rate and interest rate hedging programs using similar controls and processes where applicable hedging strategies are reviewed annually by the audit committee of the board of directors 

instruments we primarily use forward commodity contracts foreign exchange forward contracts futures swaps and options to affect risk management activities these contracts are generally widely traded instruments with standardized terms the following describes these instruments and how we use them 









financial risk management activities

we have outstanding foreign exchange contracts with a total notional amount of 785 million at december 31 2016 that are used to reduce our exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates for various currencies the change in fair value of foreign exchange contracts from a 10 weakening of the us dollar exchange rate is estimated to be a loss of approximately 5 million at december 31 2016

at december 31 2016 our outstanding long‑term debt of 6806 million including current maturities had a fair value of 7548 million a 15 increase or decrease in the rate of interest would decrease or increase the fair value of debt by approximately 510 million or 580 million respectively

we have no outstanding commodity price hedges at december 31 2016

proved reserves

proved reserves are calculated using the average price during the twelve month period ending december 31 determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the price on the first day of each month within the year unless prices are defined by contractual agreements excluding escalations based on future conditions crude oil prices used in the determination of proved reserves at december 31 2015 were 5510 per barrel for brent 2014 10135 and 5013 per barrel for wti 2014 9442 negative reserve revisions resulting from lower crude oil prices in 2015 reduced proved reserves at december 31 2015 by 234 million barrels of oil equivalent boe and represent the primary reason for the decrease in total proved reserves yearonyear these negative revisions represent primarily proved undeveloped reserves that were not economically producible at the stipulated lower prices

our total proved developed and undeveloped reserves at december 31 were as follows











proved undeveloped reserves were 27 of our total proved reserves at december 31 2015 on a boe basis 2014 47 proved reserves held under production sharing contracts totaled 5 of our crude oil and natural gas liquids reserves and 44 of our natural gas reserves at december 31 2015 2014 5 and 49 respectively

for additional information regarding our proved oil and gas reserves see the supplementary oil and gas data to the consolidated financial statements presented on pages 83 through 91 which includes a discussion of the implications that potential sustained lower crude oil prices may have on proved reserves at december 31 2016

emergency preparedness and response plans and procedures

we have in place a series of business and assetspecific emergency preparedness response and business continuity plans that detail procedures for rapid and effective emergency response and environmental mitigation activities these plans are risk appropriate and are maintained reviewed and updated as necessary to ensure their accuracy and suitability where appropriate they are also reviewed and approved by the relevant host government authorities

responder training and drills are routinely held worldwide to assess and continually improve the effectiveness of our plans our contractors service providers representatives from government agencies and where applicable joint venture partners participate in the drills to ensure that emergency procedures are comprehensive and can be effectively implemented

to complement internal capabilities and to ensure coverage for our global operations we maintain membership contracts with a network of local regional and global oil spill response and emergency response organizations at the regional and global level these organizations include clean gulf associates cga marine spill response corporation msrc marine well containment company mwcc wild well control wwc subsea well intervention service swis and oil spill response limited osrl cga and msrc are domestic spill response organizations and mwcc provides the equipment and personnel to contain underwater well control incidents in the gulf of mexico wwc provides firefighting well control and engineering services globally osrl is a global response organization and is available when needed to assist us anywhere in the world in addition to owning response assets in their own right the organization maintains business relationships that provide immediate access to additional critical response support services if required these owned response assets include nearly 300 recovery and storage vessels and barges more than 250 skimmers over 600000 feet of boom 9 capping stacks and significant quantities of dispersants and other ancillary equipment including aircraft in addition to external well control and oil spill response support we have contracts with wildlife environmental meteorology incident management medical and security resources if we were to engage these organizations to obtain additional critical response support services we would fund such services and seek reimbursement under our insurance coverage as described below in certain circumstances we pursue and enter into mutual aid agreements with other companies and government cooperatives to receive and provide oil spill response equipment and personnel support we maintain close associations with emergency response organizations through our representation on the executive committees of cga and msrc as well as the board of directors of osrl

we continue to participate in a number of industry‑wide task forces that are studying better ways to assess the risk of and prevent onshore and offshore incidents access and control blowouts in subsea environments and improve containment and recovery methods the task forces are working closely with the oil and gas industry and international government agencies to implement improvements and increase the effectiveness of oil spill prevention preparedness response and recovery processes

insurance coverage and indemnification

we maintain insurance coverage that includes coverage for physical damage to our property thirdparty liability workers’ compensation and employers’ liability general liability sudden and accidental pollution and other coverage this insurance coverage is subject to deductibles exclusions and limitations and there is no assurance that such coverage will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences and damages

the amount of insurance covering physical damage to our property and liability related to negative environmental effects resulting from a sudden and accidental pollution event excluding atlantic named windstorm coverage for which we are self‑insured varies by asset based on the assets estimated replacement value or the estimated maximum loss in the case of a catastrophic event first party coverage consists of two tiers of insurance the first 300 million of coverage is provided through an industry mutual insurance group above this 300 million threshold insurance is carried which ranges in value up to 289 billion in total depending on the asset coverage level as described above additionally we carry insurance that provides thirdparty coverage for general liability and sudden and accidental pollution up to 108 billion which coverage under a standard joint operating arrangement would be reduced to our participating interest

our insurance policies renew at various dates each year future insurance coverage could increase in cost and may include higher deductibles or retentions or additional exclusions or limitations in addition some forms of insurance may become unavailable in the future or unavailable on terms that are deemed economically acceptable

generally our drilling contracts and most of our other offshore services contracts provide for a mutual hold harmless indemnity structure whereby each party to the contract the corporation and contractor indemnifies the other party for injuries or damages to their personnel and property and often those of its contractorssubcontractors regardless of fault 

 

 

variations may include indemnity exclusions to the extent a claim is attributable to the gro ss negligence andor willful misconduct of a party third ‑party claims on the other hand are generally allocated on a fault basis 

we are customarily responsible for and indemnify the contractor against all claims including those from third‑parties to the extent attributable to pollution or contamination by substances originating from our reservoirs or other property regardless of cause including gross negligence and willful misconduct and the contractor is responsible for and indemnifies us for all claims attributable to pollution emanating from the contractor’s property additionally we are generally liable for all of our own losses and most third‑party claims associated with catastrophic losses such as damage to reservoirs blowouts cratering and loss of hole regardless of cause although exceptions for losses attributable to gross negligence andor willful misconduct do exist lastly some offshore services contracts include overall limitations of the contractor’s liability equal to the value of the contract or a fixed amount

under a standard joint operating agreement joa each party is liable for all claims arising under the joa to the extent of its participating interest operator or nonoperator variations include indemnity exclusions when the claim is based upon the gross negligence andor willful misconduct of the operator in which case the operator is solely liable the parties to the joa may continue to be jointly and severally liable for claims made by thirdparties in some jurisdictions further under some production sharing contracts between a governmental entity and commercial parties liability of the commercial parties to the government entity is joint and several

environmental

compliance with various existing environmental and pollution control regulations imposed by federal state local and foreign governments is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations but increasingly stringent environmental regulations have resulted and will likely continue to result in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us and the oil and gas industry in general we spent approximately 13 million in 2015 for environmental remediation the level of other expenditures to comply with federal state local and foreign country environmental regulations is difficult to quantify as such costs are captured as mostly indistinguishable components of our capital expenditures and operating expenses for further discussion of environmental matters see environment health and safety in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

 item 1a risk factors 

our business activities and the value of our securities are subject to significant risks including the risk factors described below these risk factors could negatively affect our operations financial condition liquidity and results of operations and as a result holders and purchasers of our securities could lose part or all of their investments it is possible that additional risks relating to our securities may be described in a prospectus supplement if we issue securities in the future

our business and operating results are highly dependent on the market prices of crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas which can be very volatile our estimated proved reserves revenue operating cash flows operating margins liquidity financial condition and future earnings are highly dependent on the prices of crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas which are volatile and influenced by numerous factors beyond our control the major foreign oil producing countries including members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec may exert considerable influence over the supply and price of crude oil and refined petroleum products their ability or inability to agree on a common policy on rates of production and other matters may have a significant impact on the oil markets other factors include but are not limited to worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas political conditions and events including instability changes in governments or armed conflict around the world and in particular in crude oil or natural gas producing regions the cost of exploring for developing and producing crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas the price and availability of alternative fuels or other forms of energy the effect of energy conservation and environmental protection efforts and overall economic conditions globally at december 31 2015 spot prices for brent crude oil and west texas intermediate crude oil closed at 3661 per barrel and 3713 per barrel respectively average prices for 2015 were 5364 per barrel for brent and 4880 per barrel for wti if crude oil prices in 2016 remain at levels consistent with or below yearend 2015 there will be a significant decrease in 2016 revenues and operating results from 2015 levels we cannot predict how long these lower price levels will continue to prevail the sentiment of commodities trading markets as well as other supply and demand factors may also influence the selling prices of crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas to the extent that we engage in hedging activities to mitigate commodity price volatility we may not realize the benefit of price increases above the hedged price in order to manage the potential volatility of cash flows and credit requirements we maintain significant bank credit facilities an inability to access renew or replace such credit facilities or access other sources of funding as they mature would negatively impact our liquidity in addition we are exposed to risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency values and may engage in hedging activities to mitigate related volatility 

if we fail to successfully increase our reserves our future crude oil and natural gas production will be adversely impacted we own or have access to a finite amount of oil and gas reserves which will be depleted over time replacement of oil and gas production and reserves including proved undeveloped reserves is subject to successful exploration drilling development activities and enhanced recovery programs therefore future oil and gas production is dependent on technical success in finding and developing additional hydrocarbon reserves exploration activity involves the interpretation of seismic and other geological and geophysical data which does not always successfully predict the presence of commercial quantities of hydrocarbons drilling risks include unexpected adverse conditions irregularities in pressure or formations equipment failure blowouts and weather interruptions future developments may be affected by unforeseen reservoir conditions which negatively affect recovery factors or flow rates reserve replacement can also be achieved through acquisition similar risks however may be encountered in the production of oil and gas on properties acquired from others in addition to the technical risks to reserve replacement replacing reserves and developing future production is also influenced by the price of crude oil and natural gas and costs of drilling and development activities persistent lower crude oil and natural gas prices such as those currently prevailing may have the effect of reducing capital available for exploration and development activity and may render certain development projects uneconomic or delay their completion and may result in negative revisions to existing reserves while increasing drilling and development costs could negatively affect expected economic returns 

there are inherent uncertainties in estimating quantities of proved reserves and discounted future net cash flows and actual quantities may be lower than estimated numerous uncertainties exist in estimating quantities of proved reserves and future net revenues from those reserves actual future production oil and gas prices revenues taxes capital expenditures operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates and could materially affect the estimated quantities of our proved reserves and the related future net revenues in addition reserve estimates may be subject to downward or upward changes based on production performance purchases or sales of properties results of future development prevailing oil and gas prices production sharing contracts which may decrease reserves as crude oil and natural gas prices increase and other factors crude oil prices declined significantly in 2015 resulting in a significant reduction to our proved reserves as of december 31 2015 if crude oil prices remain at current levels or decline further it could have a material adverse effect on our estimated proved reserves and the 

 

 

value of our business see crude oil and natural gas reserves in critical accounting policies and estimates in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

we do not always control decisions made under joint operating agreements and the parties under such agreements may fail to meet their obligations we conduct many of our ep operations through joint operating agreements with other parties under which we may not control decisions either because we do not have a controlling interest or are not operator under the agreement there is risk that these parties may at any time have economic business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours and therefore decisions may be made which are not what we believe is in our best interest moreover parties to these agreements may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone in either case the value of our investment may be adversely affected 

we are subject to changing laws and regulations and other governmental actions that can significantly and adversely affect our business federal state local territorial and foreign laws and regulations relating to tax increases and retroactive tax claims disallowance of tax credits and deductions expropriation or nationalization of property mandatory government participation cancellation or amendment of contract rights imposition of capital controls or blocking of funds changes in import and export regulations limitations on access to exploration and development opportunities antibribery or anticorruption laws as well as other political developments may affect our operations we transport some of our crude oil production particularly from the bakken shale oil play by rail recent rail accidents have raised public awareness of rail safety and resulted in heightened regulatory scrutiny in the wake of these accidents several us government agencies have issued safety advisories or emergency orders requiring rail carriers to take additional precautionary measures when shipping crude oil by rail in 2015 the department of transportation issued new standards for tank car design which could require hip to retrofit or upgrade its existing fleet of tank cars the requirements of these new regulatory actions as well as other possible regulations or voluntary measures by the rail industry aimed at increasing rail safety may lead to a significant increase in the costs of transporting crude oil and other hydrocarbons by rail and otherwise adversely affect our operations 

we have substantial capital requirements and we may not be able to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms if at all the exploration development and production of crude oil and natural gas involves substantial costs which may not be fully funded from operations for example in 2015 we had a net loss attributable to hess corporation of 3056 million and if commodity prices remain low through 2016 we are forecasting a net loss for 2016 two of the three major credit rating agencies that rate our debt have assigned an investment grade rating in january 2016 fitch ratings fitch affirmed our bbb credit rating but revised the rating outlook to negative in february 2016 standard and poor’s ratings services sp lowered our investment grade credit rating one notch to bbb with stable outlook and moody’s investors service moody’s lowered our credit rating to ba1 with stable outlook which is below investment grade although currently we do not have any borrowings under our longterm credit facility further ratings downgrades continued weakness in the oil and gas industry or negative outcomes within commodity and financial markets could adversely impact our access to capital markets by increasing the costs of financing or impacting our ability to obtain financing on satisfactory terms or at all any inability to access capital markets could adversely impact our financial adaptability and our ability to execute our strategy and may also expose us to heightened exposure to credit risk 

political instability in areas where we operate can adversely affect our business some of the international areas in which we operate and the partners with whom we operate are politically less stable than other areas and partners and may be subject to civil unrest conflict insurgency geographic territorial border disputes corruption security risks and labor unrest political and civil unrest in north africa and the middle east has affected and may affect our operations in these areas as well as oil and gas markets generally the threat of terrorism around the world also poses additional risks to the operations of the oil and gas industry 

our oil and gas operations are subject to environmental risks and environmental laws and regulations that can result in significant costs and liabilities our oil and gas operations like those of the industry are subject to environmental risks such as oil spills produced water spills gas leaks and ruptures and discharges of substances or gases that could expose us to substantial liability for pollution or other environmental damage our operations are also subject to numerous us federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations non‑compliance with these laws and regulations may subject us to administrative civil or criminal penalties remedial cleanups and natural resource damages or other liabilities in addition increasingly stringent environmental regulations have resulted and will likely continue to result in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us and the oil and gas industry in general similarly we have material legal obligations to dismantle remove and abandon production facilities and wells that will occur many years in the future in most cases these estimates may be impacted by future changes in regulations and other uncertainties 

concerns have been raised in certain jurisdictions where we have operations concerning the safety and environmental impact of the drilling and development of shale oil and gas resources particularly hydraulic fracturing water usage flaring of associated natural gas and air emissions while we believe that these operations can be conducted safely and with minimal impact on the environment regulatory bodies are responding to these concerns and may impose moratoriums and new 

 

 

regulations on such drilling operations that would likely have the effect of prohibiting or delaying such operations and increasing their cost 

climate change initiatives may result in significant operational changes and expenditures reduced demand for our products and adversely affect our business we recognize that climate change is a global environmental concern continuing political and social attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national regional or local legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions these agreements and measures may require significant equipment modifications operational changes taxes or purchase of emission credits to reduce emission of greenhouse gases from our operations which may result in substantial capital expenditures and compliance operating maintenance and remediation costs in addition our production is used to produce petroleum fuels which through normal customer use may result in the emission of greenhouse gases regulatory initiatives to reduce the use of these fuels may reduce demand for crude oil and other hydrocarbons and have an adverse effect on our sales volumes revenues and margins the imposition and enforcement of stringent greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets could severely and adversely impact the oil and gas industry and significantly reduce the value of our business 

our industry is highly competitive and many of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than we have the petroleum industry is highly competitive and very capital intensive we encounter competition from numerous companies in each of our activities including acquiring rights to explore for crude oil and natural gas many competitors including national oil companies are larger and have substantially greater resources we are also in competition with producers of other forms of energy increased competition for worldwide oil and gas assets could significantly increase the cost of acquiring oil and gas assets in addition competition for drilling services technical expertise and equipment may affect the availability of technical personnel and drilling rigs resulting in increased capital and operating costs 

catastrophic events whether naturally occurring or man‑made may materially affect our operations and financial conditions our oil and gas operations are subject to unforeseen occurrences which have affected us from time to time and which may damage or destroy assets interrupt operations and have other significant adverse effects examples of catastrophic risks include hurricanes fires explosions blowouts such as the thirdparty accident at the macondo prospect pipeline interruptions and ruptures severe weather geological events labor disputes or cyber‑attacks although we maintain insurance coverage against property and casualty losses there can be no assurance that such insurance will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences and damages moreover some forms of insurance may be unavailable in the future or be available only on terms that are deemed economically unacceptable 

significant time delays between the estimated and actual occurrence of critical events associated with development projects may result in material negative economic consequences we are involved in several large development projects and the completion of those projects may be delayed beyond what was originally anticipated such examples include but are not limited to delays in receiving necessary approvals from project members or regulatory agencies timely access to necessary equipment availability of necessary personnel and unfavorable weather conditions this may lead to delays and differences between estimated and actual timing of critical events these delays could impact our future results of operations and cash flows 

departures of key members from our senior management team andor difficulty in recruiting and retaining adequate numbers of experienced technical personnel could negatively impact our ability to deliver on our strategic goals the derivation and monitoring of successful strategies and related policies may be negatively impacted by the departure of key members of senior management moreover an inability to recruit and retain adequate numbers of experienced technical and professional personnel in the necessary locations may prohibit us from executing our strategy in full or in part with a commensurate impact on shareholder value 

we are dependent on oilfield service companies for items including drilling rigs equipment supplies and skilled labor an inability or significant delay in securing these services or a high cost thereof may result in material negative economic consequences the availability and cost of drilling rigs equipment supplies and skilled labor will fluctuate over time given the cyclical nature of the ep industry as a result we may encounter difficulties in obtaining required services or could face an increase in cost these consequences may impact our ability to run our operations and to deliver projects on time with the potential for material negative economic consequences 

we manage commodity price risk through our risk management function but such activities may impede our ability to benefit from commodity price increases and can expose us to similar potential counterparty credit risk as impacts amounts due from the sale of hydrocarbons we may enter into commodity price hedging arrangements to protect us from commodity price declines these arrangements may depending on the instruments used and the level of increases involved limit any potential upside from commodity price increases in addition as with accounts receivable we may be exposed to potential economic loss should a counterparty be unable or unwilling to perform their obligations under the terms of a hedging agreement 

cyber‑attacks targeting computer telecommunications systems and infrastructure used by the oil and gas industry 

 

 

may materiall y impact our business and operations computers and telecommunication systems are used to conduct our exploration development and production activities and have become an integral part of our business we use these systems to analyze and store financial and operating data and to communicate within our company and with outside business partners cyber ‑attacks could compromise our computer and telecommunications systems and result in disruptions to our business operations or the loss of our data and propr ietary information in addition computers control oil and gas production processing equipment and distribution systems globally and are necessary to deliver our production to market a cyber ‑attack against these operating systems or the networks and infrastructure on which they rely could damage critical production distribution andor storage assets delay or prevent delivery to markets and make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transactions as a result a cyberattack could have a material adverse impact on our cash flows and results of operations we routinely experience attempts by external parties to penetrate and attack our networks and systems although such attempts to date have not resulted in any material breaches disruptions or loss of business critical information our systems and procedures for protecting against such attacks and mitigating such risks may prove to be insufficient in the future and such attacks could have an adverse impact on our business and operations in addition as technologies evolve and these attacks become more sophisticated we may incur significant costs to upgrade or enhance our security measures to protect against such attacks

 item 3 legal proceedings

we along with many companies engaged in refining and marketing of gasoline have been a party to lawsuits and claims related to the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe in gasoline a series of similar lawsuits many involving water utilities or governmental entities were filed in jurisdictions across the us against producers of mtbe and petroleum refiners who produced gasoline containing mtbe including us the principal allegation in all cases was that gasoline containing mtbe is a defective product and that these parties are strictly liable in proportion to their share of the gasoline market for damage to groundwater resources and are required to take remedial action to ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of releases of mtbe the majority of the cases asserted against us have been settled in june 2014 the commonwealth of pennsylvania and the state of vermont each filed independent lawsuits alleging that we and all major oil companies with operations in each respective state have damaged the groundwater in those states by introducing thereto gasoline with mtbe the pennsylvania suit has been removed to federal court and has been forwarded to the existing mtbe multidistrict litigation pending in the southern district of new york the suit filed in vermont is proceeding there in a state court an action brought by the commonwealth of puerto rico was settled in conjunction with the bankruptcy court’s confirmation of hovensa’s liquidation plan which is described below

we received a directive from the new jersey department of environmental protection njdep to remediate contamination in the sediments of the lower passaic river and the njdep is also seeking natural resource damages the directive insofar as it affects us relates to alleged releases from a petroleum bulk storage terminal in newark new jersey we previously owned we and over 70 companies entered into an administrative order on consent with the environmental protection agency epa to study the same contamination this work remains ongoing we and other parties settled a cost recovery claim by the state of new jersey and also agreed with epa to fund remediation of a portion of the site the epa is continuing to study contamination and remedial designs for other portions of the river to that end in april 2014 epa issued a focused feasibility study “ffs” proposing to conduct banktobank dredging of the lower eight miles of the passaic river at an estimated cost of 17 billion epa may issue a record of decision “rod” in 2016 selecting a remedy for the lower eight miles based on the ffs but the ultimate remedy and associated cost for the lower passaic river remains uncertain at this stage the rod is unlikely to address an additional nine miles of the passaic river which may require additional remedial action in addition the federal trustees for natural resources have begun a separate assessment of damages to natural resources in the passaic river given the ongoing studies and the fact that epa has not yet selected a remedy for part or all of the lower passaic river remedial costs cannot be reliably estimated at this time

in march 2014 we received an administrative order from epa requiring us and 26 other parties to undertake the remedial design for the remedy selected by the epa for the gowanus canal superfund site in brooklyn new york the remedy includes dredging of surface sediments and the placement of a cap over the deeper sediments throughout the canal and insitu stabilization of certain contaminated sediments that will remain in place below the cap epa has estimated that this remedy will cost 506 million however the ultimate costs that will be incurred in connection with the design and implementation of the remedy remain uncertain our alleged liability derives from our former ownership and operation of a fuel oil terminal adjacent to the canal we indicated to epa that we would comply with the administrative order and are currently contributing funding for the remedial design based on an interim allocation of costs among the parties at the same time we are participating in an allocation process whereby neutral experts selected by the parties will determine the 

 

 

final shares of the remedial design c osts to be paid by each of the participants the parties have not yet addressed the allocation of costs associated with implementing the remedy that is currently being designed 

in may 2005 the government of the us virgin islands filed a complaint in the district court of the virgin islands against hovensa llc “hovensa” a 5050 joint venture between our subsidiary hess oil virgin islands corp “hovic” and a subsidiary of petroleos de venezuela sa pdvsa and other companies that operated industrial facilities on the south shore of st croix asserting that the defendants are liable under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” and territorial statutory and common law for damages to natural resources in 2014 hovic hovensa and the government of the us virgin islands entered into a settlement agreement pursuant to which hovensa paid 35 million and agreed to pay the government of the us virgin islands an additional 40 million no later than december 31 2014 on september 15 2015 hovensa filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter 11 of the united states bankruptcy code the “bankruptcy code” in the united states district court of the virgin islands  bankruptcy division the “bankruptcy court” and commenced a courtsupervised sale of substantially all of its assets pursuant to section 363 of the bankruptcy code to fund hovensas sale process and orderly winddown hovensa entered into a 40 million debtorinpossession credit facility with hovensa’s owners the terms of which were approved by the bankruptcy court on december 1 2015 the bankruptcy court entered an order approving the sale of hovensa’s terminal and refinery assets to limetree bay terminals llc “limetree” the senate of the us virgin islands approved the sale in december 2015 and the sale to limetree was completed on january 4 2016 the 40 million claim held by the us virgin islands government against hovensa on account of the 2014 settlement agreement was also paid from the sale proceeds on january 19 2016 the bankruptcy court entered an order confirming hovensa’s chapter 11 plan of liquidation the “liquidation plan” under the liquidation plan which became effective february 17 2016 hovensa established a liquidating trust to distribute certain assets and sale proceeds to its creditors established an environmental response trust to administer to hovensa’s remaining environmental obligations and will conduct an orderly winddown of its remaining activities the liquidation plan also provides for releases of any claims held by hovensa and its bankruptcy estate against us and hovic and releases any claims held by certain thirdparty creditors of hovensa against us and hovic both effective upon the effective date of the liquidation plan in connection with the liquidation plan and hovensa’s asset sale hovic relinquished its claims against hovensa on account of promissory notes issued by hovensa to hovic

on september 13 2015 the government of the us virgin islands filed a complaint against us in the territorial superior court of the virgin islands division of st croix alleging among other things that we violated territorial statutes and committed various torts in connection with the 50 ownership interest of our subsidiary hovic in hovensa in connection with the closing of hovensa’s asset sale to limetree we the government of the us virgin islands hovic hovensa and pdvsa entered into a mutual release agreement that resulted in the dismissal with prejudice of all pending litigation among those parties including the lawsuit filed by the government of the us virgin islands against us and various tax refund lawsuits filed by hovic and pdvsa against the government of the us virgin islands as part of this agreement the government of the us virgin islands also granted us hovic and hovensa a general release of all other existing claims with the exception of claims related to environmental matters which were automatically released upon the establishment of the environmental response trust in connection with the liquidation plan

on december 18 2014 the epa initiated an administrative complaint against hovensa for alleged violations of the clean air act’s risk management program requirements at the st croix facility in connection with the liquidation plan hovensa has agreed to settle the epa’s allegations with the payment of a civil penalty of 115000

in february 2015 the pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc issued a notice of determination to terminate the hovensa pension plan in connection with the hovensa’s sale to limetree and the liquidation plan the corporation assumed the hovensa pension plan upon the effective date of the liquidation plan and the pbgc withdrew its notice of determination in 2015 we recorded a charge of 30 million primarily representing the estimated net difference between the hovensa pension plan obligation and fair value of the plan assets

on july 25 2011 the virgin islands department of planning and natural resources commenced an enforcement action against hovensa by issuance of documents titled “notice of violation order for corrective action notice of assessment of civil penalty notice of opportunity for hearing” the “novs” the novs assert violations of virgin islands’ air pollution control laws and regulations arising out of odor incidents on st croix in may 2011 and proposed total penalties of 210000 we expect that any penalties arising from this matter will be covered by the liquidating trust established under the liquidation plan 

we periodically receive notices from the epa that we are a “potential responsible party” under the superfund legislation with respect to various waste disposal sites under this legislation all potentially responsible parties may be jointly and severally liable for certain sites such as those discussed above the epa’s claims or assertions of liability against us relating to these sites have not been fully developed with respect to the remaining sites the epa’s claims have been settled or a proposed settlement is under consideration in all cases for amounts that are not material the ultimate impact of these 

 

 

proceedings and of any related proceedings by private parties on our business or accounts cannot be predicted at this time due to the large number of other potentially responsible parties and the speculative nature of cleanup cost estimates but is not expected to be material 

we are from time to time involved in other judicial and administrative proceedings including proceedings relating to other environmental matters we cannot predict with certainty if how or when such proceedings will be resolved or what the eventual relief if any may be particularly for proceedings that are in their early stages of development or where plaintiffs seek indeterminate damages numerous issues may need to be resolved including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters before a loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated for any proceeding subject to the foregoing in management’s opinion based upon currently known facts and circumstances the outcome of such proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

overview 

hess corporation is a global exploration and production ep company engaged in exploration development production transportation purchase and sale of crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas with production operations located primarily in the united states us denmark equatorial guinea the joint development area of malaysiathailand jda malaysia and norway the bakken midstream operating segment which was established in the second quarter of 2015 provides feebased services including crude oil and natural gas gathering processing of natural gas and the fractionation of natural gas liquids transportation of crude oil by rail car terminaling and loading crude oil and natural gas liquids and the storage and terminaling of propane primarily in the bakken shale play of north dakota

transformation to a pure play ep company

in 2013 we announced several initiatives to continue our transformation from an integrated energy company into a more geographically focused pure play ep company these initiatives represented the culmination of a multiyear strategic transformation designed to leverage our lean manufacturing capabilities across unconventional assets exploit our deepwater drilling and project development capabilities and execute a smaller more targeted exploration program this transformation was completed in 2015

during 2013 through 2015 the corporation sold mature or lower margin ep assets in algeria azerbaijan indonesia russia thailand the united kingdom uk north sea and certain interests onshore in the us in addition the transformation plan included fully exiting the corporation’s marketing and refining mr business including its terminal retail energy marketing and energy trading operations as well as the permanent shutdown of refining operations at its port reading nj facility hovensa llc hovensa a 5050 joint venture between the corporation’s subsidiary hess oil virgin islands corp hovic and petroleos de venezuela sa pdvsa had previously shut down its us virgin islands refinery in 2012 hovensa filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter 11 of the united states bankruptcy code in the united states district court of the virgin islands in september 2015 in january 2016 limetree bay terminals llc limetree purchased the terminal and refinery assets of the st croix facility and hovensa will conduct an orderly winddown of its remaining activities see item 3 legal proceedings 

response to low oil prices

in 2015 we realized an adjusted net loss of 1113 million and incurred a net operating cash flow deficit cash flow from operating activities less cash flows from investing activities of 2225 million based on average 2015 west texas intermediate wti oil prices of 4880 per barrel brent  5364 per barrel in response to the decline in crude oil prices that began in late 2014 we conducted an extensive companywide review of our cost base and engaged with our suppliers to identify opportunities to reduce costs during 2015 as a result of these cost reduction efforts we decreased ep capital and exploratory expenditures by 400 million to 40 billion and cash operating costs by approximately 300 million versus our 2015 plan

at december 31 2015 we had 27 billion in cash and cash equivalents and total liquidity including available committed credit facilities of approximately 74 billion oil and gas production in 2016 is forecast to be in the range of 330000 to 350000 barrels of oil equivalent per day boepd compared with 375000 boepd in 2015 and we have reduced our 2016 ep capital and exploratory expenditure budget to approximately 24 billion down 40 from 2015 capital expenditures from our bakken midstream joint venture are expected to be approximately 340 million in 2016 forward strip crude oil prices for 2016 are below average prices for 2015 and as a result we forecast a significant net loss and a net operating cash flow deficit including capital expenditures in 2016 in february 2016 we issued 28750000 shares of common stock and depositary shares representing 575000 shares of 8 series a mandatory convertible preferred stock par value 1 per share with a liquidation preference of 1000 per share of convertible preferred stock for total net proceeds of approximately 16 billion we expect to fund our net operating cash flow deficit including capital expenditures for the full year of 2016 with cash on hand due to the low commodity price environment we may take other steps to improve our financial position by further reducing our planned capital program and other cash outlays accessing other sources of liquidity by issuing debt and equity securities andor pursuing further asset sales see note 23 subsequent events in the notes to the consolidated financial statements

we anticipate investing approximately 24 billion on ep capital and exploratory expenditures in 2016 reflecting a planned reduction in our work program in response to the lower commodity price environment bakken midstream capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 340 million in 2016 

 

 

consolidated results of operations 

as described in note 20 segment information  we established the bakken midstream operating segment in 2015 and have presented prior period numbers on a comparable basis the aftertax income loss by major operating activity is summarized below



the following table summarizes on an aftertax basis items of income expense that are included in net income loss and affect comparability between periods the items in the table below are explained on pages 33 through 37



in the following discussion and elsewhere in this report the financial effects of certain transactions are disclosed on an aftertax basis management reviews segment earnings on an aftertax basis and uses after‑tax amounts in its review of variances in segment earnings management believes that aftertax amounts are a preferable method of explaining variances in earnings since they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only the pretax amount aftertax amounts are determined by applying the income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pretax amounts

the following table reconciles reported net income loss attributable to hess corporation and adjusted net income loss



“adjusted net income loss” presented in this report is a nongaap financial measure which we define as reported net income loss attributable to hess corporation excluding items identified as affecting comparability of earnings between periods management uses adjusted net income loss to evaluate the corporation’s operating performance and believes that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this measure which excludes certain items that management believes are not directly related to ongoing operations and are not indicative of future business trends and operations this measure is not and should not be viewed as a substitute for us gaap net income loss

 

 

 

comparison of results 

exploration and production

following is a summarized income statement of our ep operations



excluding the ep items affecting comparability of earnings between periods in the table on page 33 the changes in ep earnings are primarily attributable to changes in selling prices production and sales volumes cost of products sold cash operating costs depreciation depletion and amortization bakken midstream tariffs exploration expenses and income taxes as discussed below

 

 

selling prices average realized crude oil selling prices including hedging were 48  lower in 2015 compared to the prior year primarily due to the declines in brent and wti crude oil prices that commenced in the fourth quarter of 2014 in addition realized selling prices for natural gas liquids and natural gas declined by 66 and 31 respectively in 2015 compared to the prior year in total lower realized selling prices reduced 2015 financial results by approximately 25 billion after income taxes compared with 2014 our average selling prices were as follows 



crude oil price hedging contracts increased ep sales and other operating revenues by 126 million 79 million after income taxes in 2015 193 million 121 million after income taxes in 2014 and 39 million 25 million after income taxes in 2013 no crude oil hedging contracts were open at december 31 2015

 

 

production volumes our net daily worldwide production was as follows 





we expect total net production to average between 330000 boepd and 350000 boepd in 2016 excluding any contribution from libya production variances related to 2015 2014 and 2013 can be summarized as follows

united states onshore crude oil and natural gas liquids production was higher in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to continued drilling in the bakken oil shale play while the increase in natural gas production was primarily attributable to the bakken and the utica shale offshore production increased in 2015 relative to 2014 as higher production from the tubular bells field which came online in november 2014 was offset primarily by lower production from the llano conger and shenzi fields crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas production was higher in 2014 compared with 2013 a result of continued development of the bakken oil shale play higher production resulting from drilling in the utica shale and a new production well combined with lower downtime at the llano field in the gulf of mexico 

europe crude oil and natural gas production was higher in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to less facility downtime and new wells at the valhall field in the current year crude oil production was lower in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to the april 2013 sale of our russian subsidiary partially offset by higher production during 2014 at the 

 

 

valhall field in norway following completion of the redevelopme nt project in 2013 higher natural gas production in 2014 compared to 2013 was a result of higher uptime from the valhall field 

africa crude oil production in africa was lower in 2015 compared to 2014 due to libyan production being shutin crude oil production in africa was lower in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to the shutdown of the es sider terminal in libya in the third quarter of 2013 following civil unrest in the country net production averaged 4000 barrels of oil per day bopd in 2014 and 13000 bopd in 2013 in december 2014 the national oil company of libya declared force majeure with respect to the waha concession and production is currently shutin 

asia and other natural gas production was lower in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to asset sales partially offset by higher production at the joint development area of malaysiathailand jda as a result of higher facility uptime crude oil production was lower in 2014 compared to 2013 as a result of the divestiture of our interests in the pangkah field in indonesia in january 2014 and our interest in the azerichiragguneshli acg fields azerbaijan in march 2013 natural gas production was lower in 2014 compared to 2013 following the divestiture of our remaining interests in indonesia and thailand in 2014 and lower production from the jda which was partially offset by a full year of production from the north malay basin 

sales volumes our worldwide sales volumes were as follows 





 

cost of products sold cost of products sold is mainly comprised of costs relating to the purchases of crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas from our partners in hess operated wells or other thirdparties as well as rail transportation fees from our bakken midstream operating segment starting in 2014 the decrease in cost of products sold in 2015 compared to 2014 principally reflects the decline in crude oil prices cost of products sold in 2014 was comparable to 2013 as a result of increased volumes purchased from partners in our operated wells being offset by lower purchases from thirdparties 

cash operating costs   cash operating costs consisting of operating costs and expenses production and severance taxes and ep general and administrative expenses decreased by 188 million in 2015 compared with the prior year 2014 315 million decrease versus 2013 the decrease in 2015 compared to 2014 is due to cost reductions across the portfolio and lower production taxes in the bakken which were partially offset by higher operating costs at tubular bells where production commenced in the fourth quarter of 2014  the decrease in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily reflects lower production taxes and operating costs following the divestitures of our remaining indonesia and thailand assets in early 2014 and our interests in russia in april 2013 as well as lower employee costs 

bakken midstream tariffs tariffs for 2015 primarily reflect higher volumes processed through the tioga gas plant which was shut down during the first quarter of 2014 to complete a plant expansion and refurbishment project the tariff arrangements were not in place prior to 2014 

depreciation depletion and amortization depreciation depletion and amortization dda costs increased by 712 million in 2015 from 2014 primarily reflecting higher production volumes from the bakken tubular bells and utica fields which had higher dda rates per barrel than the portfolio average higher production in 2014 from these fields as well as the valhall field and north malay basin were the primarily drivers for the increase in dda costs in 2014 compared to 2013  

 

 

unit costs unit cost per boe information is based on total ep production volumes and exclude items affecting comparability of earnings as disclosed below actual and forecast unit costs are as follows 







exploration expenses   exploration expenses excluding items affecting comparability of earnings described below were lower in 2015 compared to 2014 and 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to lower leasehold impairment expense geologic and seismic costs and employee expenses for 2016 we estimate exploration expenses excluding dry hole expense to be in the range of 260 million to 280 million 

income taxes excluding the impact of items affecting comparability of earnings between periods provided below the effective income tax rates for ep operations amounted to a benefit of 46 in 2015 2014 41 charge 2013 42 charge the tax benefit in 2015 resulted from operating losses while the increased effective rate from 2014 is due to a greater proportion of results attributable to higher tax jurisdictions the decline in the effective tax rate from 2014 compared with 2013 was primarily due to the impact of shut‑in production in libya from the third quarter of 2013 based on current strip crude oil prices we are forecasting a pretax loss for 2016 and as a result the ep effective tax rate excluding items affecting comparability is expected to be a benefit in the range of 41 to 45 excluding libyan operations 

items affecting comparability of earnings between periods reported ep earnings included the following items affecting comparability of income expense before and after income taxes 



the pretax amounts of ep items affecting comparability of income expense are presented in the statement of consolidated income as follow s  



 

 

items affecting comparability of earnings between periods were as follows

bakken midstream

net income loss of our bakken midstream operating segment which is primarily located in north dakota is summarized as follows



total revenues and nonoperating income in 2015 improved from 2014 mainly due to higher throughput volumes at the tioga gas plant in the fourth quarter of 2013 the tioga gas plant was shut down for a large‑scale expansion refurbishment and optimization project during which a new cryogenic processing train was installed and processing capacity was increased to 250 mmcfd from 120 mmcfd the tioga gas plant’s expanded operations commenced in late march 2014 total revenues and nonoperating income for 2014 improved from 2013 as a result of tariff arrangements becoming effective in 2014 these arrangements allow for bakken midstream operating segment to charge a fee based tariff to exploration and production for certain midstream services provided prior to 2014 when providing natural gas processing services our bakken midstream operating segment purchased unprocessed natural gas and provided processing services pursuant to percentageofproceeds contracts whereby it retained a portion of the sales proceeds received from both our ep operating segment and thirdparty customers pursuant to these contracts the bakken midstream operating segment also charged certain additional fees the remaining proceeds were remitted back to suppliers in addition total revenues and nonoperating income for 2014 also 

 

 

benefited from the large ‑scale expansion refurbishment and optimization project at the tioga gas plant which resulted in a shutdown of the plant from november 2013 to march 2014 

operating costs and expenses were higher in 2015 compared to 2014 mainly due to an increase in third‑party operating and maintenance expense operating costs and expenses were lower in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily as a result of a reduction in activity following the shutdown of the tioga gas plant between november 2013 and march 2014 depreciation depletion and amortization dda expenses were higher in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily due to a full year’s usage of the tioga gas plant in 2015 dda expenses were higher in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to the commencement of depreciation of the tioga gas plant expansion expenditures upon restart of operations in late march 2014

for 2016 we estimate net income attributable to hess corporation from the bakken midstream segment excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods to be in the range of 40 million to 50 million

corporate interest and other

the following table summarizes corporate interest and other expenses



corporate and other expenses for 2014 include a pretax gain of 13 million 8 million after income taxes related to the disposition of our 50 interest in a joint venture involved in the construction of an electric generating facility in newark new jersey excluding the gain 2015 costs are down compared to 2014 primarily due to lower employee costs and other expenses corporate expenses were lower in 2014 compared to 2013 reflecting lower employee related costs contract labor and professional fees in 2016 aftertax corporate expenses excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods are estimated to be in the range of 110 million to 120 million

interest expense was lower in 2015 compared to 2014 as lower interest rates offset higher average borrowings capitalized interest was also lower in 2015 compared to 2014 due to the cessation of capitalized interest on the tubular bells field upon first production in the fourth quarter of 2014 interest expense net was lower in 2014 compared to 2013 reflecting lower average outstanding debt lower letter of credit fees and higher capitalized interest in 2016 aftertax interest expense is estimated to be in the range of 205 million to 215 million

items affecting comparability of earnings between periods in 2015 we recorded a pretax charge of 76 million 49 million after income taxes associated with debtorinpossession financing provided to hovensa llc and the estimated liability resulting from its bankruptcy resolution see item 3 legal proceedings  in 2015 we also incurred exit costs of 6 million 4 million after income taxes and recorded a pretax gain of 20 million 13 million after income taxes from the sale of land in 2014 we recorded pretax charges of 84 million 52 million after income taxes to reduce the carrying value of our investment in the bayonne energy center to fair value 19 million 12 million after income taxes for net pre‑tax severance charges and 15 million 10 million after income taxes for exit related costs in 2013 we recorded pre‑tax charges of 21 million 13 million after income taxes for severance charges related to our transformation into a pure play ep company and 19 million 13 million after income taxes for exit related costs including costs for cessation of leased office space 

discontinued operations

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table sets forth certain relevant measures of our liquidity and capital resources at december 31







 

 

cash flows 

the following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows 



operating activities  net cash provided by operating activities declined to 1981 million in 2015 2014 4457 million primarily reflecting the decline in benchmark crude oil prices net cash provided by operating activities declined to 4457 million in 2014 2013 5098 million reflecting the impact of changes in working capital lower operating earnings primarily as a result of asset sales and the decline in benchmark crude oil prices 

investing activities   the decrease in additions to property plant and equipment in 2015 as compared to 2014 is primarily due to reduced drilling activity the bakken the utica norway and equatorial guinea reduced development expenditures at tubular bells and the jda and lower exploratory drilling activity ghana and kurdistan these reductions were offset by 2015 activity related to development activities at stampede in the gulf of mexico and exploration drilling activity in the gulf of mexico and guyana and full field development at north malay basin 

the decrease in additions to property plant and equipment in 2014 as compared with 2013 is largely due to the ongoing reduction in capital expenditures in the bakken reflecting lower well costs and completion of the tioga gas plant expansion project

total proceeds from the sale of assets related to continuing operations amounted to 50 million in 2015 2014 2978 million 2013 4458 million in 2014 we completed asset sales of our dry gas acreage in the utica shale play our assets in thailand the pangkah field offshore indonesia and our interests in two power plant joint ventures completed sales in 2013 included our interests in the beryl acg eagle ford and natuna a fields and our russian subsidiary samaranafta  

in 2014 net cash provided by investing activities from discontinued operations included proceeds of 28 billion from the sale of the retail business in addition we acquired in january 2014 our partners’ 56 interest in wilcohess a retail gasoline joint venture for approximately 290 million in june 2014 we incurred capital expenditures of 105 million related to the acquisition of previously leased retail gasoline stations both of these transactions were undertaken in connection with our divestiture of our retail business net cash provided by investing activities related to discontinued operations for 2013 includes proceeds of approximately 22 billion from the sales of our energy marketing operations and our us east coast terminal network st lucia terminal and related businesses

financing activities during 2015 we received net cash consideration of approximately 26 billion from the sale of a 50 interest in our bakken midstream business upon formation of the joint venture hip issued 600 million of debt under a term loan a facility the proceeds from the debt were distributed equally to the partners during 2014 we issued 600 million 598 million net of discount of unsecured fixed rate notes and repaid 590 million of debt including 250 million of unsecured fixed rate notes 74 million assumed in the acquisition of wilcohess and 249 million for the payment of various lease obligations primarily related to the retirement of our retail gasoline station leases in 2013 we repaid 2348 million net under available credit facilities and repaid 136 million of other debt the net repayments under the 

 

 

credit facilities consisted of 990 mil lion on our short ‑ term credit facilities 758 million on our syndicated revolving credit facility and 600 million on our asset backed credit facility 

in 2015 we paid 142 million for the purchase and settlement of common shares under our 65 billion board authorized stock repurchase plan 2014 3715 million 2013 1493 million total common stock dividends paid were 287 million in 2015 2014 303 million 2013 235 million we received net proceeds from the exercise of stock options including related income tax benefits of 12 million in 2015 2014 182 million 2013 128 million

future capital requirements and resources

at december 31 2015 we had 27 billion in cash and cash equivalents including 04 billion held outside of the us which we have the ability to repatriate without triggering a us cash tax liability and total liquidity including available committed credit facilities of approximately 74 billion oil and gas production in 2016 is forecast to be in the range of 330000 to 350000 boepd compared with 375000 boepd in 2015 and we have reduced our 2016 ep capital and exploratory expenditure budget to approximately 24 billion  down 40 from 2015 capital expenditures from our bakken midstream joint venture are expected to be approximately 340 million in 2016 forward strip crude oil prices for 2016 are below average prices for 2015 and as a result we forecast a significant net loss and a net operating cash flow deficit including capital expenditures in 2016 in february 2016 we issued 28750000 shares of common stock and depositary shares representing 575000 shares of 8 series a mandatory convertible preferred stock par value 1 with a liquidation preference of 1000 per share of convertible preferred stock for total net proceeds of approximately 16 billion we expect to fund our net operating cash flow deficit including capital expenditures for the full year of 2016 with cash on hand due to the low commodity price environment we may take other steps to improve our financial position by further reducing our planned capital program and other cash outlays accessing other sources of liquidity by issuing debt and equity securities andor pursuing further asset sales see note 23 subsequent events in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

the table below summarizes the capacity usage and available capacity of our borrowing and letter of credit facilities at december 31 2015







we had 113 million in letters of credit outstanding at december 31 2015 2014 397 million which in 2015 primarily relate to our international operations see also note 22 financial risk management activities in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

in january 2015 we entered into a 4 billion syndicated revolving credit facility that expires in january 2020 the new facility which replaced a 4 billion facility that was scheduled to expire in april 2016 can be used for borrowings and letters of credit based on our credit rating as of december 31 2015 borrowings on the facility will generally bear interest at 1075 above the london interbank offered rate libor a fee of 0175 per annum is also payable on the amount of the facility the interest rate and facility fee will be higher if our credit rating is lowered

our longterm debt agreements including the revolving credit facilities contain financial covenants that restrict the amount of total borrowings and secured debt the most restrictive of these covenants allow us to borrow up to an additional 5495 million of secured debt at december 31 2015

in july 2015 hip a 5050 joint venture between us and gip incurred 600 million of debt through a 5year term loan a facility the proceeds from the debt were distributed equally to the partners hip also entered into a 400 million 5year syndicated revolving credit facility which can be used for borrowings and letters of credit and is expected to fund the joint venture’s operating activities and capital expenditures borrowings on both loan facilities generally bear interest at the libor plus an applicable margin ranging from 110 to 200 facility fees on the revolving credit facility accrue at an applicable rate every quarter ranging from 015 to 035 per annum the interest rate and facility fee are subject to adjustment based on the joint venture’s leverage ratio which is calculated as total debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda if the joint venture obtains credit ratings pricing levels will be based on the credit ratings in effect from time to time the joint venture’s credit facilities contain financial covenants that generally 

 

 

require a leverage ratio of no more than 50 to 10 for the prior four fiscal quarters and an interest coverage ratio which is calculated as ebitda to interest expense of no less than 225 to 10 for the prior four fiscal quarters 

at december 31 2015 borrowings attributable to the joint venture which are nonrecourse to hess corporation amounted to 600 million on the term loan a loan facility and 110 million on the revolving credit facility hip is in compliance with all debt covenants at december 31 2015 and its financial covenants do not currently impact their ability to issue indebtedness to fund future capital expenditures 

we also have a shelf registration under which we may issue additional debt securities warrants common stock or preferred stock

credit ratings

two of the three major credit rating agencies that rate our debt have assigned an investment grade rating in january 2016 fitch ratings fitch affirmed our bbb credit rating but revised the rating outlook to negative in february 2016 standard and poor’s ratings services sp lowered our investment grade credit rating one notch to bbb with stable outlook and moody’s investors service moody’s lowered our credit rating to ba1 with stable outlook which is below investment grade the consequence of lower credit ratings is to increase interest rates and facility fees on our credit facilities in addition we have contractual requirements to provide collateral to certain counterparties when one rating agency rates our unsecured debt below investment grade due to the recent rating change by moody’s we may be required to issue collateral in the form of letters of credit up to approximately 200 million certain other contracts require we provide collateral when two of three rating agencies rate us below investment grade if fitch or sp were to reduce their rating on our unsecured debt below investment grade we estimate that we could be required to issue letters of credit up to an additional 200 million as of december 31 2015

contractual obligations and contingencies

the following table shows aggregate information about certain contractual obligations at december 31 2015





capital expenditures represent amounts that were contractually committed at december 31 2015 including the portion of our planned capital expenditure program for 2016 obligations for operating expenses include commitments for oil and gas production expenses seismic purchases and other normal business expenses other long‑term liabilities reflect contractually committed obligations in the consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2015 including pension plan liabilities and estimates for uncertain income tax positions

the corporation and certain of its subsidiaries lease drilling rigs tankers office space and other assets for varying periods under leases accounted for as operating leases

offbalance sheet arrangements

at december 31 2015 we have 32 million in letters of credit for which we are contingently liable see also note 19 guarantees contingencies and commitments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

foreign operations

we conduct exploration and production activities outside the us principally in europe norway and denmark africa equatorial guinea libya and ghana and asia and other joint development area of malaysiathailand malaysia 

 

 

australia guyana and canada therefore we are subject to the risks associated with foreign operations including political risk corruption acts of terrorism tax law changes and currency risk see item 1a risk factors for further details 

critical accounting policies and estimates

accounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and revenues and expenses in the statement of consolidated income  the accounting methods used can affect net income equity and various financial statement ratios however our accounting policies generally do not change cash flows or liquidity

accounting for exploration and development costs ep activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage including lease bonuses brokers’ fees and other related costs are capitalized annual lease rentals exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred costs of drilling and equipping productive wells including development dry holes and related production facilities are capitalized in production operations costs of injected co 2 for tertiary recovery are expensed as incurred 

the costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if 1 the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and 2 sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operational viability of the project if either of those criteria is not met or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project the capitalized well costs are charged to expense indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves and the economic and operating viability of a project include commitment of project personnel active negotiations for sales contracts with customers negotiations with governments operators and contractors and firm plans for additional drilling and other factors

crude oil and natural gas reserves the determination of estimated proved reserves is a significant element in arriving at the results of operations of exploration and production activities the estimates of proved reserves affect well capitalizations the unit of production depreciation rates of proved properties and wells and equipment as well as impairment testing of oil and gas assets and goodwill 

for reserves to be booked as proved they must be determined with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations in addition government and project operator approvals must be obtained and depending on the amount of the project cost senior management or the board of directors must commit to fund the project we maintain our own internal reserve estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work directly with the oil and gas properties our technical staff updates reserve estimates throughout the year based on evaluations of new wells performance reviews new technical data and other studies to provide consistency throughout the corporation standard reserve estimation guidelines definitions reporting reviews and approval practices are used the internal reserve estimates are subject to internal technical audits and senior management review we also engage an independent thirdparty consulting firm to audit approximately 80 of our total proved reserves each year

proved reserves are calculated using the average price during the twelve month period ending december 31 determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the price on the first day of each month within the year unless prices are defined by contractual agreements excluding escalations based on future conditions as discussed in item 1a risk factors  crude oil prices are volatile which can have an impact on our proved reserves for example the average west texas intermediate wti crude oil price used in the determination of proved reserves at december 31 2015 and 2014 was 5013 and 9442 per barrel respectively the drop in prices for 2015 resulted in negative revisions to our proved reserves at december 31 2015 of 234 million barrels of oil equivalent primarily related to proved undeveloped reserves at december 31 2015 spot prices for wti crude oil closed at 3713 per barrel and averaged 3178 per barrel in january 2016 if crude oil prices in 2016 stay at levels below that used in determining 2015 proved reserves we may recognize further negative revisions up to a significant majority of our december 31 2015 proved undeveloped reserves in addition we may recognize negative revisions to proved developed reserves which can vary significantly by asset due to differing operating cost structures conversely price increases in 2016 above those used in determining 2015 proved reserves could result in positive revisions to proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves at december 31 2016 it is difficult to estimate the magnitude of any potential net negative or positive change in proved reserves as of december 31 2016 due to a number of factors that are currently unknown including 2016 crude oil prices any revisions based on 2016 reservoir performance and the levels to which industry costs will change in response to movements in commodity prices a 10 change in proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves at december 31 2015 would result in an approximate 350 million pretax change in depreciation depletion and amortization expense for 2016 see the supplementary oil and gas data on pages 85 through 89 in the accompanying financial statements for additional information on our oil and gas reserves

bakken midstream joint venture on july 1 2015 we sold a 50 interest in hess infrastructure partners lp hip to global infrastructure partners gip for net cash consideration of approximately 26 billion we consolidate the activities of 

 

 

hip which qualifies as a variable interest entity vie under us generally accepted accounting principles we have concluded that we are the primary beneficiary of the vie as defined in the acco unting standards since we have the power through our 50 ownership to direct those activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of hip and are obligated to absorb losses or have the right to receive benefits that could potentially b e significant to hip this conclusion was based on a qualitative analysis that considered hip’s governance structure the commercial agreements between hip and us and the voting rights established between the members which provide us the ability to contr ol the operations of hip 

impairment of longlived assets we review long‑lived assets including oil and gas fields for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered long‑lived assets are tested based on identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities if the carrying amounts of the longlived assets are not expected to be recovered by estimated undiscounted future net cash flows the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded the amount of impairment is determined based on the estimated fair value of the assets generally determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows an income valuation approach or by a market‑based valuation approach which are level 3 fair value measurements 

in the case of oil and gas fields the present value of future net cash flows is based on management’s best estimate of future prices which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices applied to projected production volumes and discounted at a riskadjusted rate the projected production volumes represent reserves including probable reserves expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures the production volumes prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairments will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows since the standardized measure requires the use of historical twelve month average prices 

our impairment tests of long‑lived ep producing assets are based on our best estimates of future production volumes including recovery factors selling prices operating and capital costs the timing of future production and other factors which are updated each time an impairment test is performed we could have impairments if the projected production volumes from oil and gas fields decrease crude oil and natural gas selling prices decline significantly for an extended period or future estimated capital and operating costs increase significantly as a result of the extended period of low crude oil prices we tested our oil and gas properties for impairment see note 10 impairment in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

impairment of goodwill goodwill is tested for impairment annually on october 1 or when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable based on a twostep process the goodwill test is conducted at a reporting unit level which is defined in accounting standards as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment the reporting unit or units to be used in an evaluation and measurement of goodwill for impairment testing are determined from a number of factors including the manner in which the business is managed prior to the second quarter of 2015 we had one operating segment ep consisting of two reporting units offshore and onshore which reflected the manner in which performance was assessed by the operating segment manager in the second quarter of 2015 we established a second operating segment bakken midstream which previously was part of the onshore reporting unit prior to the formation of the bakken midstream operating segment the offshore reporting unit had allocated goodwill of 1098 million while the onshore reporting unit had allocated goodwill of 760 million upon formation of the bakken midstream operating segment we allocated 375 million of goodwill from the onshore reporting unit to the bakken midstream operating segment based on the relative fair values of the bakken midstream business and the remainder of the onshore reporting unit there was no change to the composition of the offshore reporting unit 

in step one of the impairment test the fair value of a reporting unit is compared with its carrying amount including goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill is not impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value we perform step two to determine possible impairment by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by assuming the reporting unit is purchased at fair value with assets and liabilities of the reporting unit being reflected at fair value in the same manner as the accounting prescribed for a business combination the resulting excess of fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to the reporting unit’s assets and liabilities represents the implied fair value of goodwill if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying amount an impairment loss would be recorded

our fair value estimate of each reporting unit is the sum of the anticipated discounted cash flows of producing assets and known development projects and an estimated market premium to reflect the market price an acquirer would pay for potential synergies including cost savings access to new business opportunities enterprise control and increased market share the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit depends on estimates about oil and gas reserves future prices timing of future net cash flows and market premiums we also consider the relative market valuation of similar peer companies and other market data if available in determining fair value of a reporting unit in addition a qualitative reconciliation of our 

 

 

market capitalization to the fair value of the reporting units used in the goodwill impairment test is performed as of the testing date to assess reasonableness of the reporting unit fair values 

significant extended declines in crude oil and natural gas prices or reduced reserve estimates could lead to a decrease in the fair value of a reporting unit that could result in failing step one and potentially result in an impairment of goodwill based on the outcome of step two if a reporting unit fails step one it is possible that the implied fair value of goodwill in step two exceeds its carrying value due to one or more assets of the reporting unit having a fair value below its carrying value

as there are significant differences in the way longlived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing there may be impairments of individual assets that would not cause an impairment of the goodwill assigned at the reporting unit level or there could be an impairment of goodwill without a corresponding impairment of an underlying asset

in the second quarter of 2015 we performed impairment tests on the offshore and onshore reporting units in accordance with accounting standards for goodwill immediately prior to creation of the bakken midstream operating segment no impairment resulted from this assessment in addition accounting standards require that following a reorganization allocated goodwill should be tested for impairment we also performed impairment tests on the allocated goodwill for the bakken midstream and the onshore reporting unit at june 30 2015 goodwill allocated to the bakken midstream operating segment passed the impairment test but the goodwill allocated to the onshore reporting unit did not pass the impairment test as a result we recorded a noncash pretax charge of 385 million 385 million after income taxes in the second quarter of 2015 to reflect the onshore reporting unit’s goodwill at its implied fair value of zero based on a hypothetical purchase price allocation as stipulated in the accounting standards 

as a result of the decline in crude oil prices in the fourth quarter of 2015 we performed an impairment test at december 31 2015 on the offshore reporting unit and determined its goodwill was impaired we recorded a pretax impairment charge of 1098 million 1098 million after income taxes to reflect the offshore reporting unit’s goodwill at its implied fair value of zero based on a hypothetical purchase price allocation as stipulated in the accounting standards we expect that the benefits of our remaining goodwill totaling 375 million will be recovered through the bakken midstream operating segment based on market conditions at december 31 2015 

income taxes judgments are required in the determination and recognition of income tax assets and liabilities in the financial statements these judgments include the requirement to only recognize the financial statement effect of a tax position when management believes that it is more likely than not that based on the technical merits the position will be sustained upon examination 

we have net operating loss carryforwards or credit carryforwards in multiple jurisdictions and have recorded deferred tax assets for those losses and credits additionally we have deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities we have net deferred tax assets of 2653 million recognized in the consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2015 regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized in evaluating the realizability of deferred tax assets we consider the reversal of temporary differences the expected utilization of net operating losses and credit carryforwards during available carryforward periods the availability of tax planning strategies the existence of appreciated assets and estimates of future taxable income and other factors estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas reserves and selling prices that are consistent with our internal business forecasts additional valuation allowances may be required if internal business forecasts adopt lower selling price assumptions or development plans we do not provide for deferred us income taxes for that portion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations

asset retirement obligations we have material legal obligations to remove and dismantle long‑lived assets and to restore land or seabed at certain exploration and production locations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we recognize a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations in addition the fair value of any legally required conditional asset retirement obligation is recorded if the liability can be reasonably estimated we capitalize such costs as a component of the carrying amount of the underlying assets in the period in which the liability is incurred in subsequent periods the liability is accreted and the asset is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset in order to measure these obligations we estimate the fair value of the obligations by discounting the future payments that will be required to satisfy the obligations in determining these estimates we are required to make several assumptions and judgments related to the scope of dismantlement timing of settlement interpretation of legal requirements inflationary factors and discount rate in addition there are other external factors which could significantly affect the ultimate settlement costs for these obligations including changes in environmental regulations and other statutory requirements fluctuations in industry costs and foreign currency exchange rates and advances in technology as a result our estimates of asset retirement obligations are subject to revision due to the factors described above changes in estimates prior to settlement result in adjustments to both the liability and related asset values 

 

 

retirement plans we have funded noncontributory defined benefit pension plans an unfunded supplemental pension plan and an unfunded postretirement medical plan we recognize the net change in the funded status of the projected benefit obligation for these plans in the consolidated balance sheet  

the determination of the obligations and expenses related to these plans are based on several actuarial assumptions the most significant of which relate to the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations expected long‑term rates of return on plan assets the rate of future increases in compensation levels and participant mortality assumptions these assumptions represent estimates made by us some of which can be affected by external factors for example the discount rate used to estimate our projected benefit obligation is based on a portfolio of high‑quality fixed income debt instruments with maturities that approximate the expected payment of plan obligations while the expected return on plan assets is developed from the expected future returns for each asset category weighted by the target allocation of pension assets to that asset category changes in these assumptions can have a material impact on the amounts reported in our financial statements

derivatives we utilize derivative instruments including futures forwards options and swaps individually or in combination to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in the prices of crude oil and natural gas as well as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates 

all derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet  our policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative the changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized currently in earnings derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions cash flow hedges or hedges of firm commitments fair value hedges the effective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income loss amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings the ineffective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recorded currently in earnings changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings the change in fair value of the related hedged commitment is recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized currently in earnings

fair value measurements we use various valuation approaches in determining fair value for financial instruments including the market and income approaches our fair value measurements also include nonperformance risk and time value of money considerations counterparty credit is considered for receivable balances and our credit is considered for accrued liabilities 

we also record certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value when required by generally accepted accounting principles these fair value measurements are recorded in connection with business combinations qualifying nonmonetary exchanges the initial recognition of asset retirement obligations and any impairment of longlived assets equity method investments or goodwill

we determine fair value in accordance with the fair value measurements accounting standard which established a hierarchy for the inputs used to measure fair value based on the source of the inputs which generally range from quoted prices for identical instruments in a principal trading market level 1 to estimates determined using related market data level 3 including discounted cash flows and other unobservable data  measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered level 2

when level 1 inputs are available within a particular market those inputs are selected for determination of fair value over level 2 or 3 inputs in the same market multiple inputs may be used to measure fair value however the level of fair value for each physical derivative and financial asset or liability is based on the lowest significant input level within this fair value hierarchy 

environment health and safety

our long term vision and values provide a foundation for how we do business and define our commitment to meeting the highest standards of corporate citizenship and creating a long lasting positive impact on the communities where we do business our strategy is reflected in our environment health safety and social responsibility ehs  sr policies and by a management system framework that helps protect our workforce customers and local communities our management systems are intended to promote internal consistency adherence to policy objectives and continual improvement in ehs  sr performance improved performance may in the short‑term increase our operating costs and could also require increased capital expenditures to reduce potential risks to assets reputation and license to operate in addition to enhanced ehs  sr performance improved productivity and operational efficiencies may be realized from investments in ehs  sr we have programs in place to evaluate regulatory compliance audit facilities train employees prevent and manage risks and emergencies and to generally meet corporate ehs  sr goals and objectives

 

 

we recognize that climate change is a global environmental concern  we assess monitor and take measures to reduce our carbon footprint at existing and planned operations we are committed to complying with al l greenhouse gas ghg emissions mandates and the responsible management of ghg emissions at our facilities 

we will have continuing expenditures for environmental assessment and remediation sites where corrective action may be necessary include onshore exploration and production facilities sites from discontinued operations as to which we retained liability and although not currently significant “superfund” sites where we have been named a potentially responsible party

we accrue for environmental assessment and remediation expenses when the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable at december 31 2015 our reserve for estimated remediation liabilities was approximately 80 million we expect that existing reserves for environmental liabilities will adequately cover costs to assess and remediate known sites our remediation spending was approximately 13 million in 2015 2014 12 million 2013 16 million the level of other expenditures to comply with federal state local and foreign country environmental regulations is difficult to quantify as such costs are captured as mostly indistinguishable components of our capital expenditures and operating expenses




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

as discussed in note 22  financial risk management activities  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  in the normal course of our business we are exposed to commodity risks related to changes in the prices of crude oil and natural gas as well as changes in interest rates and foreign currency values in the disclosures that follow financial risk management activities refer to the mitigation of these risks through hedging activities we were exposed to commodity price risks primarily related to crude oil natural gas refined petroleum products and electricity as well as foreign currency values from our 50 voting interest in a consolidated energy trading joint venture hetco which was sold in the first quarter of 2015

controls we maintain a control environment under the direction of our chief risk officer hedging strategies are reviewed annually by the audit committee of the board of directors controls include volumetric and term limits our treasury department is responsible for administering and monitoring foreign exchange rate and interest rate hedging programs using similar controls and processes where applicable 

instruments we primarily use forward commodity contracts foreign exchange forward contracts futures swaps and options these contracts are generally widely traded instruments with standardized terms the following describes these instruments and how we use them 









financial risk management activities

financial risk management activities include transactions designed to reduce risk in the selling prices of crude oil or natural gas produced by us or to reduce exposure to foreign currency or interest rate movements generally futures swaps or option strategies may be used to reduce risk in the selling price of a portion of our crude oil or natural gas production forward contracts may also be used to purchase certain currencies in which we do business with the intent of reducing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations interest rate swaps may also be used generally to convert fixed‑rate interest payments to floating

we have outstanding foreign exchange contracts used to reduce our exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates for various currencies the change in fair value of foreign exchange contracts from a 10 weakening of the us dollar exchange rate is estimated to be a loss of approximately 95 million at december 31 2015

 

 

at december 31 2015 our outstanding long ‑term debt of 6630 million including current maturities had a fair value of 6515 million a 15 increase or decrease in the rate of interes t would decrease or increase the fair value of debt by approximately 410 million or 480 million respectively 

trading activities

in february 2015 we sold our interest in our energy trading joint venture hetco which was subsequently renamed hartree partners lp hartree pursuant to the terms of the sale hartree was permitted to utilize our guarantees issued in favor of hartrees existing counterparties until november 12 2015 provided that new trades were for a period of one year or less complied with certain credit requirements and net exposures remained within value at risk limits previously applied by us the guarantees remain in effect until the qualifying trades outstanding at november 12 2015 mature we have the right to seek reimbursement from hartree and a separate hartree credit support facility upon any counterparty draw on the applicable guarantee from us no draws on the guaranteed trades have occurred through december 31 2015 a liability of 10 million associated with the guarantee is included in other accrued liabilities at december 31 2015 at december 31 2014 hetco assets totaling 1035 million consisting of accounts receivable and other longlived assets were reported in other current assets and liabilities totaling 797 million which consisted primarily of accounts payable were reported in accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet

emergency preparedness and response plans and procedures

 

the corporation has in place a series of business and assetspecific emergency preparedness response and business continuity plans that detail procedures for rapid and effective emergency response and environmental mitigation activities these plans are risk appropriate and are maintained reviewed and updated as necessary to ensure their accuracy and suitability where appropriate they are also reviewed and approved by the relevant host government authorities

 

responder training and drills are routinely held worldwide to assess and continually improve the effectiveness of the corporation’s plans the corporation’s contractors service providers representatives from government agencies and where applicable joint venture partners participate in the drills to ensure that emergency procedures are comprehensive and can be effectively implemented

 

to complement internal capabilities and to ensure coverage for its global operations the corporation maintains membership contracts with a network of local regional and global oil spill response and emergency response organizations at the regional and global level these organizations include clean gulf associates cga marine spill response corporation msrc marine well containment company mwcc wild well control wwc subsea well intervention service swis national response corporation nrc and oil spill response limited osrl cga and msrc are domestic spill response organizations and mwcc provides the equipment and personnel to contain underwater well control incidents in the gulf of mexico wwc provides firefighting well control and engineering services globally nrc and osrl are global response organizations and are available to assist the corporation when needed anywhere in the world in addition to owning response assets in their own right these organizations maintain business relationships that provide immediate access to additional critical response support services if required these owned response assets included nearly 300 recovery and storage vessels and barges more than 250 skimmers over 600000 feet of boom and significant quantities of dispersants and other ancillary equipment including aircraft in addition to external well control and oil spill response support the corporation has contracts with wildlife environmental meteorology incident management medical and security resources if the corporation were to engage these organizations to obtain additional critical response support services it would fund such services and seek reimbursement under its insurance coverage described below in certain circumstances the corporation pursues and enters into mutual aid agreements with other companies and government cooperatives to receive and provide oil spill response equipment and personnel support the corporation maintains close associations with emergency response organizations through its representation on the executive committees of cga and msrc as well as the board of directors of osrl

 

the corporation continues to participate in a number of industry‑wide task forces that are studying better ways to assess the risk of and prevent onshore and offshore incidents access and control blowouts in subsea environments and improve containment and recovery methods the task forces are working closely with the oil and gas industry and international government agencies to implement improvements and increase the effectiveness of oil spill prevention preparedness response and recovery processes

 

insurance coverage and indemnification

 

the corporation maintains insurance coverage that includes coverage for physical damage to its property third party liability workers’ compensation and employers’ liability general liability sudden and accidental pollution and other coverage this insurance coverage is subject to deductibles exclusions and limitations and there is no assurance that such coverage will adequately protect the corporation against liability from all potential consequences and damages

 

the amount of insurance covering physical damage to the corporation’s property and liability related to negative environmental effects resulting from a sudden and accidental pollution event excluding atlantic named windstorm coverage for which it is self‑insured varies by asset based on the assets estimated replacement value or the estimated maximum loss in the case of a catastrophic event first party coverage consists of two tiers of insurance the first 300 million of coverage is provided through an industry mutual insurance group above this 300 million threshold insurance is carried which ranges in value up to 253 billion in total depending on the asset coverage level as described above additionally the corporation carries insurance that provides third party coverage for general liability and sudden and accidental pollution up to 108 billion which coverage under a standard joint operating arrangement would be reduced to the corporation’s participating interest

 

 

 

the corporation’s insurance policies renew at various dates each year future insurance coverage could increase in cost and may include higher deductibles or retentions or additional exclusions or limitations in addition some forms of insurance may become unavailable in the future or unavailable on terms that are deemed economically acceptable

 

generally the corporation’s drilling contracts and most of its other offshore services contracts provide for a mutual hold harmless indemnity structure whereby each party to the contract the corporation and contractor indemnifies the other party for injuries or damages to their personnel and property and often those of its contractorssubcontractors regardless of fault variations may include indemnity exclusions to the extent a claim is attributable to the gross negligence andor willful misconduct of a party third‑party claims on the other hand are generally allocated on a fault basis

 

the corporation is customarily responsible for and indemnifies the contractor against all claims including those from third‑parties to the extent attributable to pollution or contamination by substances originating from its reservoirs or other property regardless of cause including gross negligence and willful misconduct and the contractor is responsible for and indemnifies the corporation for all claims attributable to pollution emanating from the contractor’s property additionally the corporation is generally liable for all of its own losses and most third‑party claims associated with catastrophic losses such as damage to reservoirs blowouts cratering and loss of hole regardless of cause although exceptions for losses attributable to gross negligence andor willful misconduct do exist lastly some offshore services contracts include overall limitations of the contractor’s liability equal to the value of the contract or a fixed amount

 

under a standard joint operating agreement joa each party is liable for all claims arising under the joa to the extent of its participating interest operator or nonoperator variations include indemnity exclusions when the claim is based upon the gross negligence andor willful misconduct of the operator in which case the operator is solely liable the parties to the joa may continue to be jointly and severably liable for claims made by third parties in some jurisdictions further under some production sharing contracts between a governmental entity and commercial parties liability of the commercial parties to the government entity is joint and several

 

environmental

 

compliance with various existing environmental and pollution control regulations imposed by federal state local and foreign governments is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the corporation’s financial condition or results of operations but increasingly stringent environmental regulations have resulted and will likely continue to result in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us and the oil and gas industry in general the corporation spent approximately 12 million in 2014 for environmental remediation principally relating to the downstream businesses the level of other expenditures to comply with federal state local and foreign country environmental regulations is difficult to quantify as such costs are captured as mostly indistinguishable components of the corporation’s capital expenditures and operating expenses for further discussion of environmental matters see the environment health and safety section of item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

 

number of employees

 

the number of persons employed by the corporation was approximately 3045 at december 31 2014 and approximately 12225 at december 31 2013 of which approximately 8700 related to the retail business which was sold in 2014

 item 1a risk factors related to our business and operations

 

our business activities and the value of our securities are subject to significant risk factors including those described below the risk factors described below could negatively affect our operations financial condition liquidity and results of operations and as a result holders and purchasers of our securities could lose part or all of their investments it is possible that additional risks relating to our securities may be described in a prospectus supplement if we issue securities in the future

 

our business and operating results are highly dependent on the market prices of crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas which can be very volatile our estimated proved reserves revenue operating cash flows operating margins and future earnings are highly dependent on the prices of crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas which are volatile and influenced by numerous factors beyond our control the major foreign oil producing countries including members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec exert considerable influence over the supply and price of crude oil and refined petroleum products their ability or inability to agree on a common policy on rates of production and other matters has a significant impact on the oil markets in the fourth quarter of 2014 prices for brent crude oil and west texas intermediate crude oil declined by approximately 40 to end the year at 57 per barrel and 53 per barrel respectively if crude oil prices remain at these levels for the remainder of 2015 there will be a significant decrease in 2015 revenues and earnings from 2014 levels we cannot predict how long these lower price levels will continue to prevail the commodities trading markets as well as other supply and demand factors may also influence the selling prices of crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas to the extent that we engage in hedging activities to mitigate commodity price volatility we may not realize the benefit of price increases above the hedged price changes in commodity prices can also have a material impact on collateral and margin requirements under our derivative contracts in order to manage the potential volatility of cash flows and credit requirements the corporation maintains significant bank credit facilities an inability to renew or replace such credit facilities or access other sources of funding as they mature would negatively impact our liquidity in addition we are exposed to risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency values and may engage in hedging activities to mitigate related volatility 

 

if we fail to successfully increase our reserves our future crude oil and natural gas production will be adversely impacted we own or have access to a finite amount of oil and gas reserves which will be depleted over time replacement of oil and gas production and reserves including proved undeveloped reserves is subject to successful exploration drilling development activities and enhanced recovery programs therefore future oil and gas production is dependent on technical success in finding and developing additional hydrocarbon reserves exploration activity involves the interpretation of seismic and other geological and geophysical data which does not always successfully predict the presence of commercial quantities of hydrocarbons drilling risks include unexpected adverse conditions irregularities in pressure or formations equipment failure blowouts and weather interruptions future developments may be affected by unforeseen reservoir conditions which negatively affect recovery factors or flow rates the costs of drilling and development activities have increased in recent years which could negatively affect expected economic returns reserve replacement can also be achieved through acquisition similar risks however may be encountered in the production of oil and gas on properties acquired from others in addition to the technical risks to reserve replacement replacing reserves and developing future production is also influenced by the price of crude oil and natural gas persistent lower crude oil and natural gas prices such as those currently prevailing may have the effect of reducing capital available for exploration and development activity and may render certain development projects uneconomic or delay their completion and may result in negative revisions to existing reserves 

 

there are inherent uncertainties in estimating quantities of proved reserves and discounted future net cash flows and actual quantities may be lower than estimated numerous uncertainties exist in estimating quantities of proved reserves and future net revenues from those reserves actual future production oil and gas prices revenues taxes capital expenditures operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates and could materially affect the estimated quantities of our proved reserves and the related future net revenues in addition reserve estimates may be subject to downward or upward changes based on production performance purchases or sales of properties results of future development prevailing oil and gas prices production sharing contracts which may decrease reserves as crude oil and natural gas prices increase and other factors crude oil prices declined significantly in the fourth quarter of 2014 see crude oil and natural gas reserves in critical accounting policies and estimates in item 7 – management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

 

we do not always control decisions made under joint operating agreements and the partners under such agreements may fail to meet their obligations we conduct many of our exploration and production operations through joint operating agreements with other parties under which we may not control decisions either because we do not have a controlling interest or are not operator under the agreement there is risk that these parties may at any time have economic 

 

 

business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours and therefore decisions may be made which are not what we believe is in our best interest moreover parties to these agreements may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone in either case the value of our investment may be adversely affected 

 

we are subject to changing laws and regulations and other governmental actions that can significantly and adversely affect our business federal state local territorial and foreign laws and regulations relating to tax increases and retroactive tax claims disallowance of tax credits and deductions expropriation or nationalization of property mandatory government participation cancellation or amendment of contract rights imposition of capital controls or blocking of funds changes in import and export regulations limitations on access to exploration and development opportunities antibribery or anticorruption laws as well as other political developments may affect our operations we transport some of our crude oil production particularly from the bakken shale oil play by rail recent rail accidents have raised public awareness of rail safety and resulted in heightened regulatory scrutiny we own our own fleet of tank cars that exceed the current federal standards for construction and safety we expect that in 2015 the department of transportation will issue new standards for tank car design which may require us to retrofit our existing tank cars depending on the requirements of the regulation changes in tank car design and limitations on the availability of shop capacity to undertake retrofits as well as other possible regulations aimed at increasing rail safety may lead to a significant increase in the costs of transporting crude oil and other hydrocarbons by rail and otherwise adversely affect our operations 

 

political instability in areas where we operate can adversely affect our business some of the international areas in which we operate and the partners with whom we operate are politically less stable than other areas and partners and may be subject to civil unrest conflict insurgency corruption security risks and labor unrest political and civil unrest in north africa and the middle east has affected and may affect our operations in these areas as well as oil and gas markets generally the threat of terrorism around the world also poses additional risks to the operations of the oil and gas industry 

 

our oil and gas operations are subject to environmental risks and environmental laws and regulations that can result in significant costs and liabilities our oil and gas operations like those of the industry are subject to environmental risks such as oil spills produced water spills gas leaks and ruptures and discharges of substances or gases that could expose us to substantial liability for pollution or other environmental damage our operations are also subject to numerous us federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations non‑compliance with these laws and regulations may subject us to administrative civil or criminal penalties remedial cleanups and natural resource damages or other liabilities in addition increasingly stringent environmental regulations have resulted and will likely continue to result in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us and the oil and gas industry in general similarly the corporation has material legal obligations to dismantle remove and abandon production facilities and wells that will occur many years in the future in most cases these estimates may be impacted by future changes in regulations and other uncertainties 

 

concerns have been raised in certain jurisdictions where we have operations concerning the safety and environmental impact of the drilling and development of shale oil and gas resources particularly hydraulic fracturing water usage flaring of associated natural gas and air emissions while we believe that these operations can be conducted safely and with minimal impact on the environment regulatory bodies are responding to these concerns and may impose moratoriums and new regulations on such drilling operations that would likely have the effect of prohibiting or delaying such operations and increasing their cost

 

climate change initiatives may result in significant operational changes and expenditures reduced demand for our products and adversely affect our business we recognize that climate change is a global environmental concern continuing political and social attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national regional or local legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions these agreements and measures may require significant equipment modifications operational changes taxes or purchase of emission credits to reduce emission of greenhouse gases from our operations which may result in substantial capital expenditures and compliance operating maintenance and remediation costs in addition our production is used to produce petroleum fuels which through normal customer use may result in the emission of greenhouse gases regulatory initiatives to reduce the use of these fuels may reduce our sales of crude oil and other hydrocarbons the imposition and enforcement of stringent greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets could severely and adversely impact the oil and gas industry and significantly reduce the value of our business 

 

our industry is highly competitive and many of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than we have the petroleum industry is highly competitive and very capital intensive we encounter competition from numerous companies in each of our activities including acquiring rights to explore for crude oil and natural gas many competitors 

 

 

including national oil companies are larger and have substantially greater resources we are also in competition with producers of other forms of energy increased competition for worldwide oil and gas assets has significantly increased the cost of acquiring oil and gas assets in addition competition for drilling services technical expertise and equipment may affect the availability of technical personnel and drilling rigs resulting in increased capital and operating costs 

 

catastrophic events whether naturally occurring or man‑made may materially affect our operations and financial conditions our oil and gas operations are subject to unforeseen occurrences which have affected us from time to time and which may damage or destroy assets interrupt operations and have other significant adverse effects examples of catastrophic risks include hurricanes fires explosions blowouts such as the third party accident at the macondo prospect pipeline interruptions and ruptures severe weather geological events labor disputes or cyber‑attacks although we maintain insurance coverage against property and casualty losses there can be no assurance that such insurance will adequately protect the corporation against liability from all potential consequences and damages moreover some forms of insurance may be unavailable in the future or be available only on terms that are deemed economically unacceptable 

 

significant time delays between the estimated and actual occurrence of critical events associated with development projects may result in material negative economic consequences the corporation is involved in several large development projects and the completion of those projects may be delayed beyond what was originally anticipated such examples include but are not limited to delays in receiving necessary approvals from project members or regulatory agencies timely access to necessary equipment availability of necessary personnel and unfavorable weather conditions this may lead to delays and differences between estimated and actual timing of critical events these delays could impact information detailed in forwardlooking statements and may have material negative economic consequences 

 

departures of key members from the corporation’s senior management team andor difficulty in recruiting and retaining adequate numbers of experienced technical personnel could negatively impact the corporation’s ability to deliver its strategic goals the derivation and monitoring of successful strategies and related policies may be negatively impacted by the departure of key members of senior management moreover an inability to recruit and retain adequate numbers of experienced technical and professional personnel in the necessary locations may prohibit the corporation from executing its strategy in full or in part with a commensurate impact on shareholder value 

 

the corporation is dependent on oilfield service companies for items including drilling rigs equipment supplies and skilled labor an inability or significant delay in securing these services or a high cost thereof may result in material negative economic consequences the availability and cost of drilling rigs equipment supplies and skilled labor will fluctuate over time given the cyclical nature of the exploration and production industry as a result the corporation may encounter difficulties in obtaining required services or could face an increase in cost these consequences may impact the ability of the corporation to run its operations and to deliver projects on time with the potential for material negative economic consequences 

 

cyber‑attacks targeting computer telecommunications systems and infrastructure used by the oil and gas industry may materially impact our business and operations computers and telecommunication systems are used to conduct our exploration development and production activities and have become an integral part of our business we use these systems to analyze and store financial and operating data and to communicate within our company and with outside business partners cyber‑attacks could compromise our computer and telecommunications systems and result in disruptions to our business operations or the loss of our data and proprietary information in addition computers control oil and gas production processing equipment and distribution systems globally and are necessary to deliver our production to market a cyber‑attack against these operating systems or the networks and infrastructure on which they rely could damage critical production distribution andor storage assets delay or prevent delivery to markets and make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transactions as a result a cyberattack could have a material adverse impact on our cash flows and results of operations we routinely experience attempts by external parties to penetrate and attack our networks and systems although such attempts to date have not resulted in any material breaches disruptions or loss of business critical information our systems and procedures for protecting against such attacks and mitigating such risks may prove to be insufficient in the future and such attacks could have an adverse impact on our business and operations 

 

 










 item 3 legal proceedings

 

the corporation along with many companies engaged in refining and marketing of gasoline has been a party to lawsuits and claims related to the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe in gasoline a series of similar lawsuits many involving water utilities or governmental entities were filed in jurisdictions across the us against producers of mtbe and petroleum refiners who produced gasoline containing mtbe including the corporation the principal allegation in all cases was that gasoline containing mtbe is a defective product and that these parties are strictly liable in proportion to their share of the gasoline market for damage to groundwater resources and are required to take remedial action to ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of releases of mtbe the majority of the cases asserted against the corporation have been settled in 2014 the corporation settled and paid claims against it arising out of an action brought by the state of new jersey for approximately 35 million the settlement was approved by the trial judge and the corporation paid the settlement amount in december 2014 in june 2014 the commonwealth of pennsylvania and the state of vermont each filed independent lawsuits alleging that the corporation and all major oil companies with operations in each respective state have damaged the groundwater in those states by introducing thereto gasoline with mtbe the pennsylvania suit has been removed to federal court and has been forwarded to the existing mtbe multidistrict litigation pending in the southern district of new york the suit filed in vermont is proceeding there in a state court an action brought by the commonwealth of puerto rico also remained unresolved at december 31 2014 the corporation has recorded reserves for its estimated liabilities for its unresolved mtbe lawsuits

 

the corporation received a directive from the new jersey department of environmental protection njdep to remediate contamination in the sediments of the lower passaic river and the njdep is also seeking natural resource damages the directive insofar as it affects the corporation relates to alleged releases from a petroleum bulk storage terminal in newark new jersey previously owned by the corporation the corporation and over 70 companies entered into an administrative order on consent with the environmental protection agency epa to study the same contamination the corporation and other parties recently settled a cost recovery claim by the state of new jersey and also agreed to fund remediation of a portion of the site the epa is continuing to study contamination and remedial designs for other portions of the river in addition the federal trustees for natural resources have begun a separate assessment of damages to natural resources in the passaic river given the ongoing studies remedial costs cannot be reliably estimated at this time based on currently known facts and circumstances the corporation does not believe that this matter will result in a material liability because its terminal could not have contributed contamination along most of the river’s length and did not store or use contaminants which are of the greatest concern in the river sediments and because there are numerous other parties who will likely share in the cost of remediation and damages

 

on july 25 2011 the virgin islands department of planning and natural resources commenced an enforcement action against hovensa by issuance of documents titled “notice of violation order for corrective action notice of assessment of civil penalty notice of opportunity for hearing” the “novs” the novs assert violations of virgin islands air pollution control laws and regulations arising out of odor incidents on st croix in may 2011 and proposed total penalties of 210000 hovensa believes that it has good defenses against the asserted violations

 

in july 2004 hovic and hovensa each received a letter from the commissioner of the virgin islands department of planning and natural resources and natural resources trustees advising of the trustee’s intention to bring suit against hovic and hovensa under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla the letter alleges that hovic and hovensa are potentially responsible for damages to natural resources arising from releases of hazardous substances from the hovensa refinery which had been operated by hovic until october 1998 an action was filed on may 5 2005 in the district court of the virgin islands against hovensa hovic and other companies that operated industrial facilities on the south shore of st croix asserting that the defendants are liable under cercla and territorial statutory and common law for damages to natural resources in 2014 hovic hovensa and the government of the us virgin islands entered into a settlement agreement pursuant to which hovensa paid 35 million and agreed to pay the government of the us virgin islands an additional 40 million no later than december 31 2014 hovensa was unable to make this additional payment because the usvirgin islands legislature did not approve a proposed operating agreement required to complete a proposed sale of hovensa which would have provided funds to make the settlement payment under the terms of the settlement agreement the us virgin islands government was granted a first lien on hovensa’s assets to secure the settlement payment and in january 2015 the government commenced a foreclosure action to enforce this lien hovensa intends to defend this action and may take other steps in response to the action including the sale of assets andor the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings the registrant does not believe that the resolution of this matter will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition

 

in february 2015 the pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc issued a notice of determination to terminate the hovensa pension plan hovensa had been in negotiations with the pbgc to make additional contributions to the plan 

 

 

with proceeds from a proposed sale of hovensa which was not completed for the reasons described above the registrant does not believe that the resolution of this matter will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition

 

the corporation periodically receives notices from the epa that it is a “potential responsible party” under the superfund legislation with respect to various waste disposal sites under this legislation all potentially responsible parties are jointly and severally liable for certain sites the epa’s claims or assertions of liability against the corporation relating to these sites have not been fully developed with respect to the remaining sites the epa’s claims have been settled or a proposed settlement is under consideration in all cases for amounts that are not material the ultimate impact of these proceedings and of any related proceedings by private parties on the business or accounts of the corporation cannot be predicted at this time due to the large number of other potentially responsible parties and the speculative nature of clean‑up cost estimates but is not expected to be material

 

the corporation is from time to time involved in other judicial and administrative proceedings including proceedings relating to other environmental matters the corporation cannot predict with certainty if how or when such proceedings will be resolved or what the eventual relief if any may be particularly for proceedings that are in their early stages of development or where plaintiffs seek indeterminate damages numerous issues may need to be resolved including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters before a loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated for any proceeding subject to the foregoing in management’s opinion based upon currently known facts and circumstances the outcome of such proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition results of operations or cash flows of the corporation

comparison of results

exploration and production

 

following is a summarized income statement of the corporation’s ep operations

 

 



 

excluding the ep items affecting comparability of earnings between periods in the table on page 31 the changes in ep earnings are primarily attributable to changes in selling prices production and sales volumes cost of products sold cash operating costs depreciation depletion and amortization exploration expenses and income taxes as discussed below

 

selling prices average crude oil realized selling prices were 9217 per boe in 2014 or 6 lower compared to 2013 primarily due to declines in the benchmark prices for brent and west texas intermediary wti crude oil average crude oil selling prices were 13 higher in 2013 compared to 2012 due to a combination of hedging losses realized in 2012 the second quarter 2013 sale of the corporation’s subsidiary in russia which realized significantly lower crude oil prices and slightly higher average wti benchmark prices in 2013 

 

 

 

the corporation’s average selling prices were as follows 

 



 

crude oil price hedging contracts increased ep sales and other operating revenues by 193 million 121 million after income taxes and 39 million 25 million after income taxes in 2014 and 2013 respectively and reduced ep sales and other operating revenues by 688 million 431 million after income taxes in 2012

 

production volumes the corporation’s crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas production was 329000 boepd in 2014 336000 boepd in 2013 and 406000 boepd in 2012 production volumes associated with assets sold were 8000 boepd in 2014 52000 boepd in 2013 and 117000 boepd in 2012 crude oil and natural gas liquids comprised 74 72 and 75 of the corporation’s total production in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively the corporation currently expects total worldwide production to average between 350000 boepd and 360000 boepd in 2015 excluding any contribution from libya 

 

 

the corporation’s net daily worldwide production was as follows 

 



 



 

united states crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas production was higher in 2014 compared with 2013 a result of continued development of the bakken oil shale play higher production resulting from an active drilling program in the utica shale and a new production well combined with lower downtime at the llano field in the gulf of mexico crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas production was comparable in 2013 and 2012 as higher production from the bakken oil shale play was partly offset by natural decline and maintenance in the other us assets 

 

europe crude oil production was lower in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to the april 2013 sale of the corporation’s russian subsidiary partially offset by higher production during 2014 at the vahall field in norway following completion of the redevelopment project in 2013 higher natural gas production in 2014 compared to 2013 was a result of higher uptime from the valhall field crude oil and natural gas production was lower in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to asset sales the bittern and schiehallion fields in the uk north sea which were sold in the second half of 2012 were producing at an aggregate net rate of approximately 12000 boepd at the time of sale the beryl fields also in the uk north sea which were producing at an aggregate net rate of approximately 10000 boepd at the time of sale were sold in the first quarter of 2013 and the corporation’s russian subsidiary which was producing approximately 50000 boepd at the time of sale was sold in april 2013 

 

 

 

africa crude oil production in africa was lower in 2014 compared to 2013 and from 2013 to 2012 primarily due to the shutdown of the es sider terminal in libya in the third quarter of 2013 following civil unrest in the country in december 2014 the libyan national oil company declared force majeure with respect to the waha fields and production is currently shutin the decline from 2013 compared to 2012 was also due to lower production from the okume complex in offshore equatorial guinea which was partially offset by new production from the ceiba field 

 

asia and other crude oil production was lower in 2014 compared to 2013 largely as a result of the divestiture of the corporation’s interests in the pangkah field in indonesia in january 2014 and the corporation’s interest in the azerichiragguneshli acg fields azerbaijan in march 2013 natural gas production was lower in 2014 compared to 2013 following the corporation’s divestiture of its interests in indonesia and thailand in 2014 and lower production from the joint development area of malaysiathailand jda which was partially offset by a full year of production from the north malay basin crude oil production was lower in 2013 compared to 2012 mainly due to the sale in march 2013 of the corporation’s interest in the acg fields natural gas production was lower in 2013 compared to 2012 mainly due to lower production entitlement at the jda together with lower production at the pangkah field in indonesia 

sales volumes the corporation’s worldwide sales volumes were as follows 

 



 



 

cost of products sold cost of products sold is mainly comprised of costs relating to the purchases of crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas from the corporation’s partners in hess operated wells or other third parties cost of products sold in 2014 was comparable to 2013 as a result of increased volumes purchased from partners in wells operated by the corporation being offset by lower purchases from third parties the increase in cost of products sold in 2013 compared with 2012 principally reflected higher volumes of crude oil purchases from third parties 

 

cash operating costs cash operating costs consisting of operating costs and expenses production and severance taxes and general and administrative expenses decreased by approximately 330 million in 2014 compared with 2013 and decreased by approximately 200 million in 2013 compared with 2012 the decrease in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily reflects lower production taxes and operating costs following the divestitures of indonesia and thailand assets in early 2014 and the corporation’s interests in russia in april 2013 as well as lower employee costs the decrease in 2013 was due to lower production taxes following the sale of the corporation’s russian operations and reductions in transportation costs lease operating expenses and employee costs which were partially offset by severance charges and other exit costs incurred as part of the corporation’s transformation to a more focused ep company 

 

depreciation depletion and amortization depreciation depletion and amortization charges increased by approximately 540 million in 2014 and decreased by 182 million in 2013 compared with the corresponding amounts in prior years the increase in 2014 was primarily associated with higher production volumes from the bakken utica valhall and north malay basin each of which had a dda rate higher than the portfolio average in 2014 the decrease in 2013 largely reflects asset sales and the mix of production volumes 

 

excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods in the table below cash operating costs per barrel of oil equivalent boe were 2103 in 2014 2263 in 2013 and 2063 in 2012 and depreciation depletion and amortization costs per boe were 2668 in 2014 2161 in 2013 and 1920 in 2012 total production unit costs were 4771 per boe in 2014 4424 per boe in 2013 and 3983 per boe in 2012

 

 

 

for 2015 cash operating costs are estimated to be in the range of 1950 to 2050 per boe and depreciation depletion and amortization costs are estimated to be in the range of 2850 to 2950 per boe resulting in total production unit costs of 4800 to 5000 per boe assuming no contribution from libya

 

exploration expenses exploration expenses excluding items affecting comparability of earnings were lower in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to lower leasehold impairment expense geologic and seismic costs and employee expenses exploration expenses decreased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to lower dry hole expenses and geological and seismic expenses partly offset by higher leasehold impairment expenses 

 

income taxes excluding the impact of items affecting comparability of earnings between periods provided below the effective income tax rates for ep operations were 41 in 2014 43 in 2013 and 45 in 2012 the decline in the effective income tax rate in 2014 compared with 2013 and in 2013 compared with 2012 was primarily due to the impact of shut‑in production in libya from the third quarter of 2013 based on current strip crude oil prices we are forecasting a pretax loss for 2015 and as a result the ep effective tax rate excluding items affecting comparability is expected to be a benefit in the range of 38 to 42 excluding libyan operations

future capital requirements and resources

 

the corporation anticipates investing approximately 47 billion in capital and exploratory expenditures in 2015 compared to 56 billion in 2014 based on current strip crude oil prices the corporation forecasts in 2015 a significant net loss and net cash flow deficit after funding planned capital expenditures dismantlement obligations pension contributions dividends and any share repurchases under its board authorized plan the corporation expects to fund its 2015 net cash flow deficit with existing cash on hand of 24 billion at december 31 2014 and if necessary borrowings under its longterm credit facility

 

crude oil and natural gas prices are volatile and difficult to predict in addition unplanned increases in the corporation’s capital expenditure program could occur the corporation plans to preserve its financial flexibility and to improve its cash flow by pursuing cost reductions from vendors significantly moderating stock repurchases compared with 2014 and depending on where crude oil prices trend potentially further reducing its planned capital program in addition should needs dictate the corporation may also access other sources of liquidity by utilizing other existing uncommitted credit facilities issuing debt and equity securities andor pursuing further asset sales

 

the corporation held 11 billion of its yearend 2014 total cash and cash equivalents of 24 billion outside of the us and has the ability to bring its december 31 2014 international cash balance back to the us without triggering a us cash tax liability 

 

the table below summarizes the capacity usage and available capacity of the corporation’s borrowing and letter of credit facilities at december 31 2014

accounting policies

critical accounting policies and estimates

 

accounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of assets and liabilities in the corporation’s consolidated balance sheet and revenues and expenses in the statement of consolidated income the accounting methods used can affect net income equity and various financial statement ratios however the corporation’s accounting policies generally do not change cash flows or liquidity

 

accounting for exploration and development costs ep activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage including lease bonuses brokers’ fees and other related costs are capitalized annual lease rentals exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred costs of drilling and equipping productive wells including development dry holes and related production facilities are capitalized in production operations costs of injected co 2 for tertiary recovery are expensed as incurred 

 

the costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if 1 the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and 2 sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operational viability of the project if either of those criteria is not met or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project the capitalized well costs are charged to expense indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves and the economic and operating viability of a project include commitment of project personnel active negotiations for sales contracts with customers negotiations with governments operators and contractors and firm plans for additional drilling and other factors

 

crude oil and natural gas reserves the determination of estimated proved reserves is a significant element in arriving at the results of operations of exploration and production activities the estimates of proved reserves affect well capitalizations the unit of production depreciation rates of proved properties and wells and equipment as well as impairment testing of oil and gas assets and goodwill 

 

for reserves to be booked as proved they must be determined with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations in addition government and project operator approvals must be obtained and depending on the amount of the project cost senior management or the board of directors must commit to fund the project the corporation maintains its own internal reserve estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work directly with the oil and gas properties the corporation’s technical staff updates reserve estimates throughout the year based on evaluations of new wells performance reviews new technical data and other studies to provide consistency throughout the corporation standard reserve estimation guidelines definitions reporting reviews and approval practices are used the internal reserve estimates are subject to internal technical audits and senior management review the corporation also engages an independent third party consulting firm to audit approximately 80 of the corporation’s total proved reserves each year

 

proved reserves are calculated using the average price during the twelve month period before december 31 determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the firstdayofthemonth price for each month within the year unless prices are defined by contractual agreements excluding escalations based on future conditions crude oil prices remained at significantly higher levels during the first ten months of 2014 and declined during the last two months of the year as a result the average crude oil price used to calculate proved reserves at december 31 2014 is significantly higher than the yearend 2014 crude oil price the yearend 2015 reserve estimates will be based on the same unweighted arithmetic average formula using firstdayofthemonth prices for 2015 and will reflect the current low crude oil price environment from the beginning of the year if current strip crude oil prices hold through 2015 proved reserves at december 31 2015 could be significantly lower than proved reserves at december 31 2014 it is difficult to estimate the magnitude of any net negative change in proved reserves that may result from lower crude oil prices due to a number of factors that are currently unknown including 2015 crude oil prices any revisions in proved reserves that may occur based on 2015 reservoir performance the levels to which industry costs will decline in response to lower prices and management’s plans as of december 31 2015 for developing proved undeveloped reserves through the year 2020 which will be the fiveyear window for recognizing proved undeveloped reserves as of december 31 2015 despite the uncertainties cited based on facts and assumptions existing at december 31 2014 if brent crude oil prices were to average 60 per barrel in 2015 the corporation estimates that 2015 depreciation depletion and amortization expenses would increase by not more than 75 million aftertax as a result of changes in proved reserves compared with december 31 2014 see the supplementary oil and gas data on pages 87 through 95 in the accompanying financial statements for additional information on the corporation’s oil and gas reserves

 

 

 

impairment of longlived assets the corporation reviews long‑lived assets including oil and gas fields for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered long‑lived assets are tested based on identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities if the carrying amounts of the longlived assets are not expected to be recovered by estimated undiscounted future net cash flows the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded the amount of impairment is determined based on the estimated fair value of the assets generally determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows an income valuation approach or by a market‑based valuation approach which are level 3 fair value measurements 

 

in the case of oil and gas fields the present value of future net cash flows is based on management’s best estimate of future prices which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices applied to projected production volumes and discounted at a riskadjusted rate the projected production volumes represent reserves including probable reserves expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures the production volumes prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairments will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows since the standardized measure requires the use of historical twelve month average prices 

 

the corporation’s impairment tests of long‑lived ep producing assets are based on its best estimates of future production volumes including recovery factors selling prices operating and capital costs the timing of future production and other factors which are updated each time an impairment test is performed the corporation could have impairments if the projected production volumes from oil and gas fields decrease crude oil and natural gas selling prices decline significantly for an extended period or future estimated capital and operating costs increase significantly as a result of the significant decline in crude oil prices in the fourth quarter of 2014 the corporation tested its oil and gas properties for impairment and determined no impairment existed at december 31 2014

 

impairment of goodwill the corporation’s goodwill is tested for impairment annually on october 1 st or when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable based on a twostep process the goodwill test is conducted at a reporting unit level which is defined in accounting standards as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment the reporting unit or units to be used in an evaluation and measurement of goodwill for impairment testing are determined from a number of factors including the manner in which the business is managed following a reorganization of its management structure in 2013 the corporation concluded that within its ep segment it has two reporting units offshore and onshore consistent with the manner in which performance is assessed by the operating segment manager 

 

in step one of the impairment test the fair value of a reporting unit is compared with its carrying amount including goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill is not impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value the corporation performs step two to determine possible impairment by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by assuming the reporting unit is purchased at fair value with assets and liabilities of the reporting unit being reflected at fair value in the same manner as the accounting prescribed for a business combination the resulting excess of fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to the reporting unit’s assets and liabilities represents the implied fair value of goodwill if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying amount an impairment loss would be recorded

 

the corporation’s fair value estimate of each reporting unit is the sum of the anticipated discounted cash flows of producing assets and known development projects and an estimated market premium to reflect the market price an acquirer would pay for potential synergies including cost savings access to new business opportunities enterprise control and increased market share the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit depends on estimates about oil and gas reserves future prices timing of future net cash flows and market premiums the corporation also considers the relative market valuation of similar peer companies and other market data if available in determining fair value of a reporting unit in addition a qualitative reconciliation of the corporation’s market capitalization to the fair value of the reporting units used in the goodwill impairment test is performed as of the testing date to assess reasonableness of the reporting unit fair values 

 

significant extended declines in crude oil and natural gas prices or reduced reserve estimates could lead to a decrease in the fair value of a reporting unit that could result in failing step one and potentially result in an impairment of goodwill based on the outcome of step two if a reporting unit fails step one it is possible that the implied fair value of goodwill in step two exceeds its carrying value due to one or more assets of the reporting unit having a fair value below its carrying value or one or more assets of the reporting unit having taxable temporary differences that result in recognition of goodwill for the reporting unit under purchase accounting requirements in a business combination

 

 

 

as there are significant differences in the way longlived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing there may be impairments of individual assets that would not cause an impairment of the goodwill assigned at the reporting unit level or there could be an impairment of goodwill without a corresponding impairment of an underlying asset

 

crude oil prices declined significantly following the date of the corporation’s annual goodwill impairment test on october 1 2014 in addition the corporation’s stock price decreased to a level at december 31 2014 that resulted in the corporation’s book value exceeding its market capitalization by 6 as a result of these potential indicators of impairment the corporation performed a separate goodwill impairment test at december 31 2014 the offshore and onshore reporting units which have allocated goodwill of 1098 million and 760 million respectively at december 31 2014 each passed step one of the impairment test however the onshore reporting unit’s fair value exceeded its carrying value by 5 while not required the corporation performed a hypothetical step two test for the onshore reporting unit and estimated that the implied fair value of goodwill exceeded its carrying value accordingly the corporation expects that the benefits of its goodwill totaling 1858 million will be recovered through the operations of each of its reporting units based on market conditions at december 31 2014

 

income taxes judgments are required in the determination and recognition of income tax assets and liabilities in the financial statements these judgments include the requirement to only recognize the financial statement effect of a tax position when management believes that it is more likely than not that based on the technical merits the position will be sustained upon examination 

 

the corporation has net operating loss carryforwards or credit carryforwards in multiple jurisdictions and has recorded deferred tax assets for those losses and credits additionally the corporation has deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized in evaluating the realizability of deferred tax assets the corporation considers the reversal of temporary differences the expected utilization of net operating losses and credit carryforwards during available carryforward periods the availability of tax planning strategies the existence of appreciated assets and estimates of future taxable income and other factors estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas reserves and selling prices that are consistent with the corporation’s internal business forecasts the corporation does not provide for deferred us income taxes for that portion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations

 

asset retirement obligations the corporation has material legal obligations to remove and dismantle long‑lived assets and to restore land or seabed at certain exploration and production locations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles the corporation recognizes a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations in addition the fair value of any legally required conditional asset retirement obligations is recorded if the liability can be reasonably estimated the corporation capitalizes such costs as a component of the carrying amount of the underlying assets in the period in which the liability is incurred in order to measure these obligations the corporation estimates the fair value of the obligations by discounting the future payments that will be required to satisfy the obligations in determining these estimates the corporation is required to make several assumptions and judgments related to the scope of dismantlement timing of settlement interpretation of legal requirements inflationary factors and discount rate in addition there are other external factors which could significantly affect the ultimate settlement costs for these obligations including changes in environmental regulations and other statutory requirements fluctuations in industry costs and foreign currency exchange rates and advances in technology as a result the corporation’s estimates of asset retirement obligations are subject to revision due to the factors described above changes in estimates prior to settlement result in adjustments to both the liability and related asset values 

 

retirement plans the corporation has funded noncontributory defined benefit pension plans an unfunded supplemental pension plan and an unfunded postretirement medical plan the corporation recognizes in the consolidated balance sheet the net change in the funded status of the projected benefit obligation for these plans 

 

the determination of the obligations and expenses related to these plans are based on several actuarial assumptions the most significant of which relate to the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations expected long‑term rates of return on plan assets the rate of future increases in compensation levels and participant mortality assumptions these assumptions represent estimates made by the corporation some of which can be affected by external factors for example the discount rate used to estimate the corporation’s projected benefit obligation is based on a portfolio of high‑quality fixed income debt instruments with maturities that approximate the expected payment of plan obligations 

 

 

while the expected return on plan assets is developed from the expected future returns for each asset category weighted by the target allocation of pension assets to that asset category changes in these assumptions can have a material impact on the amounts reported in the corporation’s financial statements

 

derivatives the corporation utilizes derivative instruments for both financial risk management and trading activities in financial risk management activities the corporation uses futures forwards options and swaps individually or in combination to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in the prices of crude oil and natural gas as well as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates in trading activities the corporation principally through a consolidated partnership trades energy‑related commodities and derivatives including futures forwards options and swaps based on expectations of future market conditions the energy trading joint venture hetco was sold in the first quarter of 2015 

 

all derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in the corporation’s consolidated balance sheet the corporation’s policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative the changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized currently in earnings derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions cash flow hedges or hedges of firm commitments fair value hedges the effective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income loss amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings the ineffective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recorded currently in earnings changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings the change in fair value of the related hedged commitment is recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized currently in earnings

 

derivatives that are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges are tested for effectiveness prospectively before they are executed and both prospectively and retrospectively on an ongoing basis to determine whether they continue to qualify for hedge accounting the prospective and retrospective effectiveness calculations are performed using either historical simulation or other statistical models which utilize historical observable market data consisting of futures curves and spot prices

 

fair value measurements the corporation uses various valuation approaches in determining fair value for financial instruments including the market and income approaches the corporation’s fair value measurements also include nonperformance risk and time value of money considerations counterparty credit is considered for receivable balances and the corporation’s credit is considered for accrued liabilities 

 

the corporation also records certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value when required by generally accepted accounting principles these fair value measurements are recorded in connection with business combinations qualifying nonmonetary exchanges the initial recognition of asset retirement obligations and any impairment of longlived assets equity method investments or goodwill

 

the corporation determines fair value in accordance with the fair value measurements accounting standard which established a hierarchy for the inputs used to measure fair value based on the source of the inputs which generally range from quoted prices for identical instruments in a principal trading market level 1 to estimates determined using related market data level 3 measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered level 2

 

when level 1 inputs are available within a particular market those inputs are selected for determination of fair value over level 2 or 3 inputs in the same market to value derivatives that are characterized as level 2 and 3 the corporation uses observable inputs for similar instruments that are available from exchanges pricing services or broker quotes these observable inputs may be supplemented with other methods including internal extrapolation or interpolation that result in the most representative prices for instruments with similar characteristics multiple inputs may be used to measure fair value however the level of fair value for each physical derivative and financial asset or liability is based on the lowest significant input level within this fair value hierarchy

 

details on the methods and assumptions used to determine the fair values are as follows

 

fair value measurements based on level 1 inputs measurements that are most observable are based on quoted prices of identical instruments obtained from the principal markets in which they are traded closing prices are both readily available and representative of fair value market transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to assure liquidity 

 

 

 

fair value measurements based on level 2 inputs measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered level 2 measurements based on level 2 inputs include over‑the‑counter derivative instruments that are priced on an exchange traded curve but have contractual terms that are not identical to exchange traded contracts 

 

fair value measurements based on level 3 inputs measurements that are least observable are estimated from related market data determined from sources with little or no market activity for comparable contracts or are positions with longer durations fair values determined using discounted cash flows and other unobservable data are also classified as level 3 

environment health and safety

the corporation’s long term vision and values provide a foundation for how we do business and define our commitment to meeting the highest standards of corporate citizenship and creating a long lasting positive impact on the communities where we do business the corporation’s strategy is reflected in its environment health safety and social responsibility ehs  sr policies and by a management system framework that helps protect the corporation’s workforce customers and local communities the corporation’s management systems are intended to promote internal consistency adherence to policy objectives and continual improvement in ehs  sr performance improved performance may in the short‑term increase the corporation’s operating costs and could also require increased capital expenditures to reduce potential risks to assets reputation and license to operate in addition to enhanced ehs  sr performance improved productivity and operational efficiencies may be realized from investments in ehs  sr the corporation has programs in place to evaluate regulatory compliance audit facilities train employees prevent and manage risks and emergencies and to generally meet corporate ehs  sr goals and objectives

 

the corporation recognizes that climate change is a global environmental concern the corporation assesses monitors and takes measures to reduce our carbon footprint at existing and planned operations the corporation is committed to complying with all greenhouse gas ghg emissions mandates and the responsible management of ghg emissions at its facilities

 

the corporation will have continuing expenditures for environmental assessment and remediation sites where corrective action may be necessary include onshore exploration and production facilities sites from discontinued operations as to which the corporation retained liability and although not currently significant “superfund” sites where the corporation has been named a potentially responsible party

 

the corporation accrues for environmental assessment and remediation expenses when the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable at year‑end 2014 the corporation’s reserve for estimated remediation liabilities was approximately 80 million the corporation expects that existing reserves for environmental liabilities will adequately cover costs to assess and remediate known sites the corporation’s remediation spending was approximately 12 million in 2014 16 million in 2013 and 19 million in 2012 the level of other expenditures to comply with federal state local and foreign country environmental regulations is difficult to quantify as such costs are captured as mostly indistinguishable components of the corporation’s capital expenditures and operating expenses

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

tableend

 

as discussed in note 21  financial risk management and trading activities  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  the corporation is exposed in the normal course of its business to commodity risks related to changes in the prices of crude oil and natural gas as well as changes in interest rates and foreign currency values in the disclosures that follow financial risk management activities refer to the mitigation of these risks through hedging activities the corporation is also exposed to commodity price risks primarily related to crude oil natural gas refined petroleum products and electricity as well as foreign currency values from its 50 voting interest in a consolidated energy trading joint venture hetco which was sold in the first quarter of 2015

 

in conjunction with the corporation’s sale of its energy marketing business in the fourth quarter of 2013 certain derivative contracts including new transactions following the closing date the “delayed transfer derivative contracts” were not transferred to the acquirer direct energy a north american subsidiary of centrica plc centrica as required customer or regulatory consents had not been obtained however the agreement entered into between hess and direct energy on the closing date transferred all economic risks and rewards of the energy marketing business including the ownership of the delayed transfer derivative contracts to direct energy the transfer of these remaining contracts was completed during the third quarter of 2014

 

controls the corporation maintains a control environment under the direction of its chief risk officer and through its corporate risk policy which the corporation’s senior management has approved controls include volumetric term and value at risk limits the chief risk officer must approve the trading of new instruments or commodities risk limits are monitored and are reported on a daily basis to business units and senior management the corporation’s financial risk management department also performs independent price verifications ipv’s of sources of fair values and validations of valuation models these controls apply to all of the corporation’s financial risk management and trading activities including the consolidated trading joint venture the corporation’s treasury department is responsible for administering and monitoring foreign exchange rate and interest rate hedging programs using similar controls and processes where applicable 

 

value at risk the corporation uses value at risk to monitor and control commodity risk within its financial risk management and trading activities the value at risk model uses historical simulation and the results represent the potential loss in fair value over one day at a 95 confidence level the model captures both first and second order sensitivities for options results may vary from time to time as strategies change in trading activities or hedging levels change in financial risk management activities 

 

instruments the corporation primarily uses forward commodity contracts foreign exchange forward contracts futures swaps options and energy commodity based securities in its financial risk management and trading activities these contracts are generally widely traded instruments with standardized terms the following describes these instruments and how the corporation uses them 

 













 

 

financial risk management activities

 

financial risk management activities include transactions designed to reduce risk in the selling prices of crude oil or natural gas produced by the corporation or to reduce exposure to foreign currency or interest rate movements generally futures swaps or option strategies may be used to reduce risk in the selling price of a portion of the corporation’s crude oil or natural gas production forward contracts may also be used to purchase certain currencies in which the corporation does business with the intent of reducing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations interest rate swaps may also be used generally to convert fixed‑rate interest payments to floating

 

the corporation has outstanding foreign exchange contracts used to reduce its exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates for various currencies the change in fair value of foreign exchange contracts from a 10 weakening of the us dollar exchange rate is estimated to be a loss of approximately 120 million at december 31 2014

 

the corporation’s outstanding long‑term debt of 5987 million including current maturities had a fair value of 7003 million at december 31 2014 a 15 decrease in the rate of interest would increase the fair value of debt by approximately 485 million at december 31 2014 a 15 increase in the rate of interest would decrease the fair value of debt by approximately 430 million at december 31 2014

 

following is the value at risk for the corporation’s financial risk management commodity derivatives activities associated with continuing operations excluding foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives described above

 item 1a risk factors related to our business and operations 

our business activities and the value of our securities are subject to significant risk factors including those described below the risk factors described below could negatively affect our operations financial condition liquidity and results of operations and as a result holders and purchasers of our securities could lose part or all of their investments it is possible that additional risks relating to our securities may be described in a prospectus supplement if we issue securities in the future 

our business and operating results are highly dependent on the market prices of crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas which can be very volatile our estimated proved reserves revenue operating cash flows operating margins and future earnings are highly dependent on the prices of crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas which are volatile and influenced by numerous factors beyond our control the major foreign oil producing countries including members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec exert considerable influence over the supply and price of crude oil and refined petroleum products their ability or inability to agree on a common policy on rates of production and other matters has a significant impact on the oil markets the commodities trading markets as well as other supply and demand factors may also influence the selling prices of crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas to the extent that we engage in hedging activities to mitigate commodity price volatility we may not realize the benefit of price increases above the hedged price changes in commodity prices can also have a material impact on collateral and margin requirements under our derivative contracts in order to manage the potential volatility of cash flows and credit requirements the corporation utilizes significant bank credit facilities an inability to renew or replace such credit facilities or access other sources of funding as they mature would negatively impact our liquidity in addition we are exposed to risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency values and may engage in hedging activities to mitigate related volatility 

if we fail to successfully increase our reserves our future crude oil and natural gas production will be adversely impacted we own or have access to a finite amount of oil and gas reserves which will be depleted over time replacement of oil and gas production and reserves including proved undeveloped reserves is subject to successful exploration drilling development activities and enhanced recovery programs therefore future oil and gas production is dependent on technical success in finding and developing additional hydrocarbon reserves exploration activity involves the interpretation of seismic and other geological and geophysical data which does not always successfully predict the presence of commercial quantities of hydrocarbons drilling risks include unexpected adverse conditions irregularities in pressure or formations equipment failure blowouts and weather interruptions future developments may be affected by unforeseen reservoir conditions which negatively affect recovery factors or flow rates the costs of drilling and development activities have increased in recent years which could negatively affect expected economic returns reserve replacement can also be 

  

achieved through acquisition similar risks however may be encountered in the production of oil and gas on properties acquired from others 

there are inherent uncertainties in estimating quantities of proved reserves and discounted future net cash flows and actual quantities may be lower than estimated numerous uncertainties exist in estimating quantities of proved reserves and future net revenues from those reserves actual future production oil and gas prices revenues taxes capital expenditures operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates and could materially affect the estimated quantities of our proved reserves and the related future net revenues in addition reserve estimates may be subject to downward or upward changes based on production performance purchases or sales of properties results of future development prevailing oil and gas prices production sharing contracts which may decrease reserves as crude oil and natural gas prices increase and other factors 

we do not always control decisions made under joint operating agreements and the partners under such agreements may fail to meet their obligations we conduct many of our exploration and production operations through joint operating agreements with other parties under which we may not control decisions either because we do not have a controlling interest or are not operator under the agreement there is risk that these parties may at any time have economic business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours and therefore decisions may be made which are not what we believe is in our best interest moreover parties to these agreements may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone in either case the value of our investment may be adversely affected 

we are subject to changing laws and regulations and other governmental actions that can significantly and adversely affect our business federal state local territorial and foreign laws and regulations relating to tax increases and retroactive tax claims disallowance of tax credits and deductions expropriation or nationalization of property mandatory government participation cancellation or amendment of contract rights imposition of capital controls or blocking of funds changes in import and export regulations limitations on access to exploration and development opportunities as well as other political developments may affect our operations as a result of the accident in april 2010 at the bp plc bp operated macondo prospect in the gulf of mexico in which the corporation was not a participant and the ensuing significant oil spill a temporary drilling moratorium was imposed in the gulf of mexico while this moratorium has since been lifted significant new regulations have been imposed and further legislation and regulations may be proposed the new regulatory environment has resulted in a longer permitting process and higher costs we also transport some of our crude oil production particularly from the bakken shale oil play by rail recent rail accidents have raised public awareness of rail safety and may result in heightened regulatory scrutiny that may lead to an increase in the costs of transporting crude oil and other hydrocarbons by rail and otherwise adversely impact our operations 

political instability in areas where we operate can adversely affect our business some of the international areas in which we operate and the partners with whom we operate are politically less stable than other areas and partners political and civil unrest in north africa and the middle east has affected and may affect our operations in these areas as well as oil and gas markets generally for example production at the waha fields in libya which has a net production capacity of approximately 25000 boepd has been shutin since august 2013 and was also shutin for eight months in 2011 due to civil unrest the threat of terrorism around the world also poses additional risks to the operations of the oil and gas industry 

our oil and gas operations are subject to environmental risks and environmental laws and regulations that can result in significant costs and liabilities our oil and gas operations like those of the industry are subject to environmental risks such as oil spills produced water spills gas leaks and ruptures and discharges of substances or gases that could expose us to substantial liability for pollution or other environmental damage our operations are also subject to numerous us federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations noncompliance with these laws and regulations may subject us to administrative civil or criminal penalties remedial cleanups and natural resource damages or other liabilities in addition increasingly stringent environmental regulations have resulted and will likely continue to result in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us and the oil and gas industry in general 

concerns have been raised in certain jurisdictions where we have operations concerning the safety and environmental impact of the drilling and development of shale oil and gas resources particularly hydraulic fracturing water usage flaring of associated natural gas and air emissions while we believe that these operations can be conducted safely and with minimal impact on the environment regulatory bodies are responding to these concerns and may impose moratoriums and new regulations on such drilling operations that would likely have the effect of prohibiting or delaying such operations and increasing their cost for example a moratorium prohibiting hydraulic fracturing is currently impacting the corporation’s exploration activities in france 

  

concerns about climate change may result in significant operational changes and expenditures reduced demand for our products and adversely affect our business we recognize that climate change is a global environmental concern continuing political and social attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national regional or local legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions these agreements and measures may require significant equipment modifications operational changes taxes or purchase of emission credits to reduce emission of greenhouse gases from our operations which may result in substantial capital expenditures and compliance operating maintenance and remediation costs in addition our production is used to produce petroleum fuels which through normal customer use may result in the emission of greenhouse gases regulatory initiatives to reduce the use of these fuels may reduce our sales of crude oil and other hydrocarbons the imposition and enforcement of stringent greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets could severely and adversely impact the oil and gas industry and significantly reduce the value of our business finally to the extent that climate change may result in more extreme weather related events we could experience increased costs related to prevention maintenance and remediation of affected operations in addition to higher costs and lost revenues related to delays and shutdowns 

our industry is highly competitive and many of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than we have the petroleum industry is highly competitive and very capital intensive we encounter competition from numerous companies in each of our activities including acquiring rights to explore for crude oil and natural gas many competitors including national oil companies are larger and have substantially greater resources we are also in competition with producers of other forms of energy increased competition for worldwide oil and gas assets has significantly increased the cost of acquiring oil and gas assets in addition competition for drilling services technical expertise and equipment may affect the availability of technical personnel and drilling rigs resulting in increased capital and operating costs 

catastrophic events whether naturally occurring or manmade may materially affect our operations and financial conditions our oil and gas operations are subject to unforeseen occurrences which have affected us from time to time and which may damage or destroy assets interrupt operations and have other significant adverse effects examples of catastrophic risks include hurricanes fires explosions blowouts such as the third party accident at the macondo prospect pipeline interruptions and ruptures severe weather geological events labor disputes or cyberattacks although we maintain insurance coverage against property and casualty losses there can be no assurance that such insurance will adequately protect the corporation against liability from all potential consequences and damages moreover some forms of insurance may be unavailable in the future or be available only on terms that are deemed economically unacceptable 

cyberattacks targeting our computer and telecommunications systems and infrastructure used by the oil and gas industry may materially impact our business and operations computers and telecommunication systems are used to conduct our exploration development and production activities and have become an integral part of our business we use these systems to analyze and store financial and operating data and to communicate within our company and with outside business partners cyberattacks could compromise our computer and telecommunications systems and result in disruptions to our business operations the loss or corruption of our data and proprietary information and communications interruptions in addition computers control oil and gas distribution systems globally and are necessary to deliver our production to market a cyberattack impacting these distribution systems or the networks and infrastructure on which they rely could damage critical production distribution andor storage assets delay or prevent delivery to markets and make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transactions our systems and procedures for protecting against such attacks and mitigating such risks may prove to be insufficient and such attacks could have an adverse impact on our business and operations 










 item 3 legal proceedings 

the corporation along with many other companies engaged in refining and marketing of gasoline has been a party to lawsuits and claims related to the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe in gasoline a series of similar lawsuits many involving water utilities or governmental entities were filed in jurisdictions across the us against producers of mtbe and petroleum refiners who produced gasoline containing mtbe including the corporation the principal allegation in all cases was that gasoline containing mtbe is a defective product and that these parties are strictly liable in proportion to their share of the gasoline market for damage to groundwater resources and are required to take remedial action to ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of releases of mtbe in 2008 the majority of the cases against the corporation were settled in 2010 and 2011 additional cases were settled including an action brought in state court by the state of new hampshire cases brought by the state of new jersey and the commonwealth of puerto rico remain unresolved the corporation has reserves recorded which it believes are adequate to cover its expected liability in these cases 

  

the corporation received a directive from the new jersey department of environmental protection njdep to remediate contamination in the sediments of the lower passaic river and the njdep is also seeking natural resource damages the directive insofar as it affects the corporation relates to alleged releases from a petroleum bulk storage terminal in newark new jersey previously owned by the corporation the corporation and over 70 companies entered into an administrative order on consent with the environmental protection agency epa to study the same contamination the corporation and other parties recently settled a cost recovery claim by the state of new jersey and also agreed to fund remediation of a portion of the site the epa is continuing to study contamination and remedial designs for other portions of the river in addition the federal trustees for natural resources have begun a separate assessment of damages to natural resources in the passaic river given the ongoing studies remedial costs cannot be reliably estimated at this time based on currently known facts and circumstances the corporation does not believe that this matter will result in a material liability because its terminal could not have contributed contamination along most of the river’s length and did not store or use contaminants which are of the greatest concern in the river sediments and because there are numerous other parties who will likely share in the cost of remediation and damages 

on july 25 2011 the virgin islands department of planning and natural resources commenced an enforcement action against hovensa by issuance of documents titled “notice of violation order for corrective action notice of assessment of civil penalty notice of opportunity for hearing” the “novs” the novs assert violations of virgin islands air pollution control laws and regulations arising out of odor incidents on st croix in may 2011 and proposed total penalties of 210000 hovensa believes that it has good defenses against the asserted violations 

in july 2004 hovic and hovensa each received a letter from the commissioner of the virgin islands department of planning and natural resources and natural resources trustees advising of the trustee’s intention to bring suit against hovic and hovensa under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla the letter alleges that hovic and hovensa are potentially responsible for damages to natural resources arising from releases of hazardous substances from the hovensa refinery which had been operated by hovic until october 1998 an action was filed on may 5 2005 in the district court of the virgin islands against hovensa hovic and other companies that operated industrial facilities on the south shore of st croix asserting that the defendants are liable under cercla and territorial statutory and common law for damages to natural resources the cercla claims have been dismissed and a trial is scheduled in june 2014 on the remaining claims hovic and hovensa are continuing to vigorously defend this matter and do not believe that this matter will result in a material liability as they believe that they have strong defenses against this complaint 

the corporation periodically receives notices from the epa that it is a “potential responsible party” under the superfund legislation with respect to various waste disposal sites under this legislation all potentially responsible parties are jointly and severally liable for certain sites the epa’s claims or assertions of liability against the corporation relating to these sites have not been fully developed with respect to the remaining sites the epa’s claims have been settled or a proposed settlement is under consideration in all cases for amounts that are not material the ultimate impact of these proceedings and of any related proceedings by private parties on the business or accounts of the corporation cannot be predicted at this time due to the large number of other potentially responsible parties and the speculative nature of cleanup cost estimates but is not expected to be material 

the corporation is from time to time involved in other judicial and administrative proceedings including proceedings relating to other environmental matters the corporation cannot predict with certainty if how or when such proceedings will be resolved or what the eventual relief if any may be particularly for proceedings that are in their early stages of development or where plaintiffs seek indeterminate damages numerous issues may need to be resolved including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters before a loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated for any proceeding subject to the foregoing in management’s opinion based upon currently known facts and circumstances the outcome of such proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition results of operations or cash flows of the corporation

production capacity of approximately 25000 boepd and is shutin due to civil unrest in the country pro forma production excluding libya was 270000 boepd in 2013 and 268000 boepd in 2012 

the following is an update of significant ep activities during 2013 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

downstream businesses 

the downstream businesses reported income of 1189 million in 2013 and 231 million in 2012 and a loss of 584 million in 2011 excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods on page 31 the downstream businesses generated income of 116 million in 2013 and 160 million in 2012 and a loss of 59 million in 2011 the downstream businesses comprise the corporation’s retail energy marketing terminal energy trading and refining operations together with its interests in two power plant joint ventures by yearend all of these businesses were either divested by the corporation or the divestiture processes remained ongoing 

liquidity and capital and exploratory expenditures 

net cash provided by operating activities was 4870 million in 2013 5660 million in 2012 and 4984 million in 2011 at december 31 2013 cash and cash equivalents totaled 1814 million up from 642 million at december 31 2012 total debt was 5798 million at december 31 2013 and 8111 million at december 31 2012 the corporation’s debt to capitalization ratio at december 31 2013 was 190 compared with 277 at the end of 2012

 the corporation anticipates investing approximately 58 billion in ep capital and exploratory expenditures in 2014 and approximately 350 million for retail marketing primarily for the acquisition of its partner’s share of the wilcohess joint venture which closed in january 2014 

consolidated results of operations 

the aftertax income loss by major operating activity is summarized below 

 

  

 

  

  

the following table summarizes on an aftertax basis items of income expense that are included in net income and affect comparability between periods the items in the table below are explained on pages 28 through 31 

 

  

 

in the following discussion and elsewhere in this report the financial effects of certain transactions are disclosed on an aftertax basis management reviews segment earnings on an aftertax basis and uses aftertax amounts in its review of variances in segment earnings management believes that aftertax amounts are a preferable method of explaining variances in earnings since they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only the pretax amount aftertax amounts are determined by applying the income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pretax amounts 

comparison of results 

exploration and production 

following is a summarized income statement of the corporation’s ep operations 

 

  

 

excluding the ep items affecting comparability of earnings between periods in the table on page 28 the changes in ep earnings are primarily attributable to changes in selling prices production and sales volumes cost of products sold cash operating costs depreciation depletion and amortization exploration expenses and income taxes as discussed below 

selling prices average crude oil realized selling prices were 13 higher in 2013 compared to 2012 due to a combination of hedging losses realized in 2012 the second quarter 2013 sale of the corporation’s subsidiary in russia which had significantly lower crude oil prices and slightly higher average west texas intermediary wti benchmark prices in 2013 average crude oil realized selling prices were 3 lower in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to lower average wti benchmark prices 

  

the corporation’s average selling prices were as follows 

 

  

 

crude oil price hedging contracts increased ep sales and other operating revenues by 39 million 25 million after income taxes in 2013 and reduced ep sales and other operating revenues by 688 million 431 million after income taxes in 2012 and 517 million 327 million after income taxes in 2011 during 2013 the corporation had brent crude oil fixedprice swap contracts to hedge 90000 barrels of oil per day bopd of crude oil sales volumes at an average price of 10970 per barrel in 2012 the corporation had brent crude oil fixedprice swap contracts to hedge 120000 bopd of crude oil sales volumes for the full year at an average price of 10770 per barrel in 2011 and 2012 the corporation also realized hedge losses from previously closed brent crude oil hedges that covered 24000 bopd during the year the corporation has entered into brent crude oil fixedprice swap contracts to hedge 25000 bopd for calendar year 2014 at an average price of 10912 per barrel 

production volumes the corporation’s crude oil and natural gas production was 336000 boepd in 2013 406000 boepd in 2012 and 370000 boepd in 2011 approximately 72 in 2013 75 in 2012 and 72 in 2011 of the corporation’s 

  

production was from crude oil and natural gas liquids the corporation currently expects total worldwide production to average between 305000 boepd and 315000 boepd in 2014 excluding asset sales and any contribution from libya which has a net production capacity of approximately 25000 boepd and is shutin due to civil unrest in the country 

the corporation’s net daily worldwide production was as follows 

 

  

 

 

 united states crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas production was comparable in 2013 and 2012 as higher production from the bakken oil shale play was partly offset by natural decline and maintenance in the other us assets crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas production was higher in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to new wells in the bakken oil shale play in the second quarter of 2012 production restarted following the successful workover of a well in the llano field which had been shutin for mechanical reasons since the first quarter of 2011 

europe crude oil and natural gas production was lower in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to asset sales the bittern and schiehallion fields in the uk north sea which were sold in the second half of 2012 were producing at an aggregate net rate of approximately 12000 boepd at the time of sale the beryl fields also in the uk north sea which were producing at an aggregate net rate of approximately 10000 boepd at the time of sale were sold in the first quarter of 2013 and the corporation’s russian subsidiary which was producing approximately 50000 boepd at the time of sale was sold in april 2013 crude oil production in 2012 was lower than 2011 primarily due to the downtime at the valhall field in 

  

norway during the second half of 2012 natural gas production was lower in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to the sale of the snohvit field offshore norway in january 2012 downtime at the valhall field and natural decline at the beryl fields in the uk north sea 

africa crude oil production in africa was lower in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to the shutdown of the es sider terminal in libya in the third quarter of 2013 following civil unrest in the country in addition offshore equatorial guinea production was lower due to decline at the okume complex partially offset by new production from the ceiba field crude oil production increased in 2012 compared with 2011 mainly due to the resumption of production in libya partly offset by lower production in equatorial guinea due to downtime and natural field decline 

asia and other crude oil production was lower in 2013 compared to 2012 mainly due to the sale in march 2013 of the corporation’s interest in the azerichiragguneshli acg fields in azerbaijan the assets were producing at a net rate of approximately 6000 boepd at the time of sale natural gas production was lower in 2013 compared to 2012 mainly due to lower production entitlement at the joint development area of malaysiathailand jda together with lower production at the pangkah field in indonesia following the facility’s shutdown for planned maintenance in the second quarter of 2013 natural gas production in 2012 was higher than 2011 primarily due to new wells at the pangkah field in indonesia and a full year’s contribution from the gajah baru complex at the natuna a field in indonesia which commenced production in the fourth quarter of 2011 

sales volumes the corporation’s worldwide sales volumes were as follows 

 

  

 

 

 cost of products sold cost of products sold is mainly comprised of costs relating to the purchases of crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas from the corporation’s partners in hess operated wells or other third parties the increase in cost of products sold in the 2013 compared with 2012 and 2011 principally reflected higher volumes of crude oil purchases from third parties 

cash operating costs cash operating costs consisting of operating costs and expenses production and severance taxes and general and administrative expenses decreased by 201 million in 2013 compared with 2012 and increased by 401 million in 2012 compared with 2011 the decrease in 2013 was due to lower production taxes mainly due to the sale of the corporation’s russian operations lower transportation costs lower lease operating expenses and employee costs partly offset by severance charges and other exit costs incurred as part of the corporation’s transformation to a pure play ep company the increase in costs in 2012 reflects higher production taxes as a result of increased production volumes at the bakken oil shale play and in russia together with higher operating and maintenance costs at the valhall field in norway the llano field offshore us in the gulf of mexico and the bakken onshore in the us 

  

depreciation depletion and amortization depreciation depletion and amortization charges decreased by 182 million in 2013 and increased by 548 million in 2012 compared with the corresponding amounts in prior years the decrease in 2013 primarily reflects asset sales and the mix of production volumes the increase in 2012 was primarily due to higher volumes and per barrel costs associated with the assets that contributed the production growth 

excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods in the table below cash operating costs per barrel of oil equivalent were 2263 in 2013 2063 in 2012 and 1971 in 2011 and depreciation depletion and amortization costs per barrel of oil equivalent were 2161 in 2013 1920 in 2012 and 1706 in 2011 total production unit costs were 4424 per boe in 2013 3983 per boe in 2012 and 3677 per boe in 2011 excluding assets sold classified as held for sale and any contribution from libyan operations pro forma total production unit costs for 2013 were 4980 per boe 

for 2014 cash operating costs are estimated to be in the range of 2050 to 2150 per barrel and depreciation depletion and amortization costs are estimated to be in the range of 2900 to 3000 per barrel resulting in total production unit costs of 4950 to 5150 per barrel of oil equivalent assuming no contribution from libya 

exploration expenses exploration expenses decreased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to lower dry hole expenses and geological and seismic expenses partly offset by higher leasehold amortization expenses dry hole expenses in 2013 included an amount to writeoff previously capitalized wells in area 54 offshore libya leasehold amortization expenses in 2013 included a charge to writeoff the corporation’s leasehold acreage in the marcellus onshore us exploration expenses decreased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to lower dry hole expenses and lease amortization dry hole expenses in 2012 included amounts associated with two exploration wells ness deep in the gulf of mexico and ajek1 offshore indonesia 

income taxes excluding the impact of items affecting comparability of earnings between periods provided below the effective income tax rates for ep operations were 43 in 2013 45 in 2012 and 38 in 2011 the decrease in the effective income tax rate in 2013 compared with 2012 was primarily due to the impact of shutin production in libya from the third quarter of 2013 the increase in the effective income tax rate in 2012 compared with 2011 was predominantly due to the resumption of libyan operations which were shutin for substantially all of 2011 the effective income tax rate for ep operations in 2014 excluding items affecting comparability of earnings is estimated to be in the range of 37 to 41 assuming no contribution from libya

corporate and interest 

the following table summarizes corporate and interest expenses 

 

  

 

corporate expenses were comparable in 2013 2012 and 2011 aftertax corporate expenses in 2014 are estimated to be in the range of 125 million to 135 million down from adjusted expenses excluding items affecting comparability provided below of 161 million in 2013 

the decrease in 2013 interest expense net primarily reflects higher capitalized interest related to the tubular bells and north malay basin projects the increase in 2012 interest expense net principally reflects higher average debt and bank facility fees partially offset by higher capitalized interest due to the sanctioning of the tubular bells project in september 2011 aftertax interest expense in 2014 is expected to be in the range of 225 million to 235 million down from 255 million in 2013

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table sets forth certain relevant measures of the corporation’s liquidity and capital resources at december 31 

 

  

 

 

   

cash flows 

the following table sets forth a summary of the corporation’s cash flows 

 

  

 

operating activities  net cash provided by operating activities amounted to 4870 million in 2013 compared with 5660 million in 2012 reflecting decreases in cash flows from changes in working capital operating cash flow increased to 5660 million in 2012 from 4984 million in 2011 principally reflecting higher operating earnings and increases in cash flows from changes in working capital 

investing activities the following table summarizes the corporation’s capital expenditures 

 

  

 

the decrease in capital expenditures in 2013 as compared to 2012 was mainly due to reduced capital expenditures in the bakken resulting from fewer drilling rigs being operated in the field as well as lower costs per well and at the valhall field following the completion of the redevelopment project in january 2013 as well as asset sales the increased spend on capital expenditures in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily reflected additional spending at the bakken oil shale play as a result of more drilling rigs operated in the field higher working interest wells and increased spending on field infrastructure projects capital expenditures in 2011 included acquisitions of approximately 800 million for 195000 net acres in the utica shale play in ohio 214 million for interests in two blocks in the kurdistan region of iraq and 116 million for an additional 4 interest in the south arne field in denmark 

  

total proceeds from the sale of ep assets was approximately 45 billion in 2013 843 million in 2012 and 490 million in 2011 completed sales in 2013 included the corporation’s interests in the beryl acg eagle ford and natuna a fields its russian subsidiary samaranafta and proceeds of approximately 22 billion from the sale of the corporation’s energy marketing operations and its us east coast terminal network st lucia terminal and related businesses 

financing activities during 2013 the corporation repaid a net amount of 2348 million under available credit facilities and repaid 136 million of other debt the net repayments under the credit facilities consisted of 990 million on the corporation’s shortterm credit facilities 758 million on its syndicated revolving credit facility and 600 million on its asset backed credit facility during 2012 the corporation borrowed a net of 1845 million from available credit facilities which consisted of borrowings of 758 million from its syndicated revolving credit facility 890 million from its shortterm credit facilities and 250 million from its assetbacked credit facility partially offset by net repayments of other debt of 53 million during 2011 net borrowings on available credit facilities were 422 million 

in 2013 the corporation used approximately 15 billion of cash from the proceeds of its asset divestiture program for the repurchase of common shares under a board authorized 4 billion repurchase plan total common stock dividends paid were 235 million in 2013 171 million in 2012 and 136 million in 2011 in the third quarter of 2013 the corporation increased its quarterly dividend to 025 per common share from 010 per share in 2012 the corporation made five quarterly common stock dividend payments as a result of accelerating payment of the fourth quarter 2012 dividend which historically would have been paid in the first quarter of 2013 the corporation received net proceeds from the exercise of stock options including related income tax benefits of 128 million 11 million and 88 million in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively 

future capital requirements and resources 

the corporation anticipates investing a total of approximately 58 billion in capital and exploratory expenditures during 2014 for ep operations and approximately 350 million for retail marketing primarily for the acquisition of its partner’s interest in the wilcohess joint venture the corporation expects to fund its 2014 projected cash flow deficit including capital expenditures dismantlement obligations dividends pension contributions debt repayments and share repurchases under its board authorized plan with existing cash onhand cash flows from operations and proceeds from asset sales looking forward the corporation expects its continued production growth driven largely by the bakken valhall and tubular bells to generate free cash flow post 2014 at 100 brent prices 

crude oil and natural gas prices are volatile and difficult to predict in addition unplanned increases in the corporation’s capital expenditure program could occur if conditions were to change such as a significant decrease in commodity prices or an unexpected increase in capital expenditures the corporation would take steps to protect its financial flexibility and may pursue other sources of liquidity including discontinuing stock repurchases reducing its planned capital program utilizing existing credit facilities issuing debt and equity securities andor further asset sales 

the table below summarizes the capacity usage and available capacity of the corporation’s borrowing and letter of credit facilities at december 31 2013

see also item 1a risk factors related to our business and operations 

accounting policies 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

accounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of assets and liabilities in the corporation’s consolidated balance sheet and revenues and expenses in the statement of consolidated income the accounting methods used can affect net income equity and various financial statement ratios however the corporation’s accounting policies generally do not change cash flows or liquidity 

accounting for exploration and development costs ep activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage including lease bonuses brokers’ fees and other related costs are capitalized annual lease rentals exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred costs of drilling and equipping productive wells including development dry holes and related production facilities are capitalized in production operations costs of injected co 2 for tertiary recovery are expensed as incurred 

the costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if 1 the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and 2 sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operational viability of the project if either of those criteria is not met or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project the capitalized well costs are charged to expense indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves and the economic and operating viability of a project include commitment of project personnel active negotiations for sales contracts with customers negotiations with governments operators and contractors and firm plans for additional drilling and other factors 

crude oil and natural gas reserves the determination of estimated proved reserves is a significant element in arriving at the results of operations of exploration and production activities the estimates of proved reserves affect well capitalizations the unit of production depreciation rates of proved properties and wells and equipment as well as impairment testing of oil and gas assets and goodwill 

for reserves to be booked as proved they must be determined with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations in addition government and project operator approvals must be obtained and depending on the amount of the project cost senior management or the board of directors must commit to fund the project the corporation maintains its own internal reserve estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work directly with the oil and gas properties the corporation’s technical staff updates reserve estimates throughout the year based on evaluations of new wells performance reviews new technical data and other studies to provide consistency throughout the corporation standard reserve estimation guidelines definitions reporting reviews and approval practices are used the internal reserve estimates are subject to internal technical 

  

audits and senior management review the corporation also engages an independent third party consulting firm to audit approximately 80 of the corporation’s total proved reserves 

impairment of longlived assets and goodwill as explained below there are significant differences in the way longlived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing the corporation reviews longlived assets including oil and gas fields for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered longlived assets are tested based on identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities if the carrying amounts of the longlived assets are not expected to be recovered by undiscounted future net cash flow estimates the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded the amount of impairment is based on the estimated fair value of the assets generally determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows an income valuation approach or by a marketbased valuation approach which are level 3 fair value measurements 

in the case of oil and gas fields the present value of future net cash flows is based on management’s best estimate of future prices which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices applied to projected production volumes and discounted at a riskadjusted rate the projected production volumes represent reserves including probable reserves expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures 

the production volumes prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairments will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows since the standardized measure requires the use of historical twelve month average prices 

the corporation’s impairment tests of longlived ep producing assets are based on its best estimates of future production volumes including recovery factors selling prices operating and capital costs the timing of future production and other factors which are updated each time an impairment test is performed the corporation could have impairments if the projected production volumes from oil and gas fields decrease crude oil and natural gas selling prices decline significantly for an extended period or future estimated capital and operating costs increase significantly 

the corporation’s goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable the goodwill test is conducted at a reporting unit level which is defined in accounting standards as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment the reporting unit or units to be used in an evaluation and measurement of goodwill for impairment testing are determined from a number of factors including the manner in which the business is managed following a reorganization of its management structure in 2013 the corporation has concluded that within its ep segment it has two reporting units offshore and onshore consistent with the manner in which performance is assessed by the segment manager accordingly the corporation expects that the benefits of goodwill will be recovered through the operations of each of its reporting units 

the corporation’s fair value estimate of each reporting unit is the sum of the discounted anticipated cash flows of producing assets and known developments and an estimated market premium to reflect the market price an acquirer would pay for potential synergies including cost savings access to new business opportunities enterprise control and increased market share the corporation also considers the relative market valuation of similar onshore and offshore peer companies the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit depends on estimates about oil and gas reserves future prices timing of future net cash flows and market premiums significant extended declines in crude oil and natural gas prices or reduced reserve estimates could lead to a decrease in the fair value of a reporting unit that could result in an impairment of goodwill 

as there are significant differences in the way longlived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing there may be impairments of individual assets that would not cause an impairment of the goodwill assigned at the reporting unit level 

income taxes judgments are required in the determination and recognition of income tax assets and liabilities in the financial statements these judgments include the requirement to only recognize the financial statement effect of a tax position when management believes that it is more likely than not that based on the technical merits the position will be sustained upon examination 

the corporation has net operating loss carryforwards or credit carryforwards in several jurisdictions including the united states and has recorded deferred tax assets for those losses and credits additionally the corporation has deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized if it is more likely than not that some or all of the 

  

deferred tax assets will not be realized a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized in evaluating realizability of deferred tax assets the corporation refers to the reversal periods for available carryforward periods for net operating losses and credit carryforwards temporary differences the availability of tax planning strategies the existence of appreciated assets and estimates of future taxable income and other factors estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas reserves and selling prices that are consistent with the corporation’s internal business forecasts additionally the corporation has income taxes which have been deferred on intercompany transactions eliminated in consolidation related to transfers of property plant and equipment remaining within the consolidated group the amortization of these income taxes deferred on intercompany transactions will occur ratably with the recovery through depletion and depreciation of the carrying value of these assets the corporation does not provide for deferred us income taxes for that portion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations 

asset retirement obligations the corporation has material legal obligations to remove and dismantle longlived assets and to restore land or seabed at certain exploration and production locations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles the corporation recognizes a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations in addition the fair value of any legally required conditional asset retirement obligations is recorded if the liability can be reasonably estimated the corporation capitalizes such costs as a component of the carrying amount of the underlying assets in the period in which the liability is incurred in order to measure these obligations the corporation estimates the fair value of the obligations by discounting the future payments that will be required to satisfy the obligations in determining these estimates the corporation is required to make several assumptions and judgments related to the scope of dismantlement timing of settlement interpretation of legal requirements inflationary factors and discount rate in addition there are other external factors which could significantly affect the ultimate settlement costs for these obligations including changes in environmental regulations and other statutory requirements fluctuations in industry costs and foreign currency exchange rates and advances in technology as a result the corporation’s estimates of asset retirement obligations are subject to revision due to the factors described above changes in estimates prior to settlement result in adjustments to both the liability and related asset values 

retirement plans the corporation has funded noncontributory defined benefit pension plans and an unfunded supplemental pension plan the corporation recognizes in the consolidated balance sheet the net change in the funded status of the projected benefit obligation for these plans 

the determination of the obligations and expenses related to these plans are based on several actuarial assumptions the most significant of which relate to the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations expected longterm rates of return on plan assets and rate of future increases in compensation levels these assumptions represent estimates made by the corporation some of which can be affected by external factors for example the discount rate used to estimate the corporation’s projected benefit obligation is based on a portfolio of highquality fixed income debt instruments with maturities that approximate the expected payment of plan obligations while the expected return on plan assets is developed from the expected future returns for each asset category weighted by the target allocation of pension assets to that asset category changes in these assumptions can have a material impact on the amounts reported in the corporation’s financial statements 

derivatives the corporation utilizes derivative instruments for both risk management and trading activities in risk management activities the corporation uses futures forwards options and swaps individually or in combination to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in the prices of crude oil natural gas refined petroleum products and electricity as well as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates in trading activities the corporation principally through a consolidated partnership trades energyrelated commodities and derivatives including futures forwards options and swaps based on expectations of future market conditions 

all derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in the corporation’s consolidated balance sheet the corporation’s policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative the changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized currently in earnings derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions cash flow hedges or hedges of firm commitments fair value hedges the effective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income loss amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings the ineffective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recorded currently in earnings changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings the change in fair value of the related hedged commitment is recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized currently in earnings 

  

derivatives that are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges are tested for effectiveness prospectively before they are executed and both prospectively and retrospectively on an ongoing basis to determine whether they continue to qualify for hedge accounting the prospective and retrospective effectiveness calculations are performed using either historical simulation or other statistical models which utilize historical observable market data consisting of futures curves and spot prices 

fair value measurements the corporation’s derivative instruments are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings or other comprehensive income each period as appropriate the corporation uses various valuation approaches in determining fair value including the market and income approaches the corporation’s fair value measurements also include nonperformance risk and time value of money considerations counterparty credit is considered for receivable balances and the corporation’s credit is considered for accrued liabilities 

the corporation also records certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value when required by generally accepted accounting principles these fair value measurements are recorded in connection with business combinations qualifying nonmonetary exchanges the initial recognition of asset retirement obligations and any impairment of longlived assets equity method investments or goodwill 

the corporation determines fair value in accordance with the fair value measurements accounting standard which established a hierarchy for the inputs used to measure fair value based on the source of the inputs which generally range from quoted prices for identical instruments in a principal trading market level 1 to estimates determined using related market data level 3 measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered level 2 

when level 1 inputs are available within a particular market those inputs are selected for determination of fair value over level 2 or 3 inputs in the same market to value derivatives that are characterized as level 2 and 3 the corporation uses observable inputs for similar instruments that are available from exchanges pricing services or broker quotes these observable inputs may be supplemented with other methods including internal extrapolation or interpolation that result in the most representative prices for instruments with similar characteristics multiple inputs may be used to measure fair value however the level of fair value for each physical derivative and financial asset or liability is based on the lowest significant input level within this fair value hierarchy 

details on the methods and assumptions used to determine the fair values are as follows 

fair value measurements based on level 1 inputs measurements that are most observable are based on quoted prices of identical instruments obtained from the principal markets in which they are traded closing prices are both readily available and representative of fair value market transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to assure liquidity the fair value of certain of the corporation’s exchange traded futures and options are considered level 1 

fair value measurements based on level 2 inputs measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered level 2 measurements based on level 2 inputs include overthecounter derivative instruments that are priced on an exchange traded curve but have contractual terms that are not identical to exchange traded contracts the corporation utilizes fair value measurements based on level 2 inputs for certain forwards swaps and options 

fair value measurements based on level 3 inputs measurements that are least observable are estimated from related market data determined from sources with little or no market activity for comparable contracts or are positions with longer durations for example the corporation sold natural gas and electricity to customers and offsets the price exposure by purchasing forward contracts the fair value of these sales and purchases may be based on specific prices at less liquid delivered locations which are classified as level 3 fair values determined using discounted cash flows and other unobservable data are also classified as level 3

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of its business the corporation is exposed to commodity risks related to changes in the prices of crude oil natural gas refined petroleum products and electricity as well as to changes in interest rates and foreign currency values in the disclosures that follow risk management activities are referred to as corporate risk management activities the corporation also has trading operations through a 50 voting interest in a consolidated partnership that trades energyrelated commodities securities and derivatives these activities are also exposed to commodity risks primarily related to the prices of crude oil natural gas refined petroleum products and electricity the following describes how these risks are controlled and managed 

in november 2013 the corporation completed the sale of its energy marketing business to direct energy a north american subsidiary of centrica plc centrica certain derivative contracts including new transactions following the closing date the “delayed transfer derivative contracts” have not been transferred to direct energy as required customer or regulatory consents have not been obtained however the agreement entered into between hess and direct energy on the closing date transfers all economic risks and rewards of the energy marketing business including the ownership of the 

  

delayed transfer derivative contracts to direct energy as a result the assets and liabilities related to the delayed transfer derivative contracts remain on the corporation’s consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2013 but changes in their fair value are offset based on the terms of the agreement between hess and direct energy the corporation therefore has no market risk related to these delayed transfer derivative contracts and only retains credit risk exposure which has been guaranteed by centrica it is expected that the transfer of these contracts will be substantially complete in the first half of 2014 

controls the corporation maintains a control environment under the direction of its chief risk officer and through its corporate risk policy which the corporation’s senior management has approved controls include volumetric term and value at risk limits the chief risk officer must approve the trading of new instruments or commodities risk limits are monitored and are reported on a daily basis to business units and senior management the corporation’s risk management department also performs independent price verifications ipv’s of sources of fair values and validations of valuation models these controls apply to all of the corporation’s risk management and trading activities including the consolidated trading partnership the corporation’s treasury department is responsible for administering and monitoring foreign exchange rate and interest rate hedging programs using similar controls and processes where applicable 

the corporation uses value at risk to monitor and control commodity risk within its risk management and trading activities the value at risk model uses historical simulation and the results represent the potential loss in fair value over one day at a 95 confidence level the model captures both first and second order sensitivities for options results may vary from time to time as strategies change in trading activities or hedging levels change in risk management activities 

instruments the corporation primarily uses forward commodity contracts foreign exchange forward contracts futures swaps options and energy commodity based securities in its risk management and trading activities these contracts are generally widely traded instruments with standardized terms the following describes these instruments and how the corporation uses them 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 corporate risk management activities 

corporate risk management activities include transactions designed to reduce risk in the selling prices of crude oil or natural gas produced by the corporation or to reduce exposure to foreign currency or interest rate movements generally futures swaps or option strategies may be used to reduce risk in the selling price of a portion of the corporation’s crude oil or natural gas production forward contracts may also be used to purchase certain currencies in which the corporation does 

  

business with the intent of reducing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations interest rate swaps may also be used generally to convert fixedrate interest payments to floating 

the corporation has entered into brent crude oil fixed price swap contracts to hedge 25000 boepd for calendar year 2014 at an average price of 10912 per barrel the corporation has outstanding foreign exchange contracts used to reduce its exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates for various currencies the change in fair value of foreign exchange contracts from a 10 strengthening of the us dollar exchange rate is estimated to be a gain of approximately 4 million at december 31 2013 

the corporation’s outstanding longterm debt of 5798 million including current maturities had a fair value of 6641 million at december 31 2013 a 15 decrease in the rate of interest would increase the fair value of debt by approximately 160 million at december 31 2013 a 15 increase in the rate of interest would decrease the fair value of debt by approximately 150 million at december 31 2013 

following is the value at risk for the corporation’s risk management commodity derivatives activities associated with continuing operations excluding foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives described above 

 

  

 

the increase in the value at risk for the corporation’s risk management commodity derivatives activities at december 31 2013 is primarily due to the new brent crude oil cash flow hedge positions entered in december 2013 as described in note 23 risk management and trading activities in the notes to the consolidated financial statements

gulf of mexico update 

the corporation currently holds interests in 223 exploration blocks in the gulf of mexico in addition to 29 developed blocks the corporation received approval for its oil spill response plan for the gulf of mexico in may 2012 and is currently awaiting approval for an updated gulf of mexico operator oil spill contingency plan in response to recent regulatory changes the corporation also fully implemented the bureau of safety and environmental enforcement required safety and environmental management system in 2012 

emergency preparedness and response plans and procedures 

the corporation has in place a series of business and assetspecific emergency preparedness response and business continuity plans that detail procedures for rapid and effective emergency response and environmental mitigation activities these plans are risk appropriate and are maintained reviewed and updated as necessary to ensure their accuracy and suitability where appropriate they are also reviewed and approved by the relevant host government authorities 

responder training and drills are routinely held worldwide to assess and continually improve the effectiveness of the corporation’s plans the corporation’s contractors service providers representatives from government agencies and where applicable joint venture partners participate in the drills to ensure that emergency procedures are comprehensive and can be effectively implemented 

to complement internal capabilities and to ensure coverage for its global operations the corporation maintains membership contracts with a network of local regional and global oil spill response and emergency response organizations at the regional and global level these organizations include clean gulf associates cga marine well containment company mwcc wild well control wwc national response corporation nrc and oil spill response osr cga is a regional spill response organization and mwcc provides the equipment and personnel to contain an underwater well control incident in the gulf of mexico wwc provides firefighting well control and engineering services globally nrc and osr are global response organizations and are available to assist the corporation when needed anywhere in the world in addition to owning response assets in their own right these organizations maintain business relationships that provide immediate access to additional critical response support services if required these owned response assets included nearly 300 recovery and storage vessels and barges more than 250 skimmers over 300000 feet of boom and significant quantities of dispersants and other ancillary equipment including aircraft if the corporation were to engage these organizations to obtain additional critical response support services it would fund such services and seek reimbursement under its insurance coverage described below in certain circumstances the corporation pursues and enters into mutual aid agreements with other companies and government cooperatives to receive and provide oil spill response equipment and personnel support the corporation maintains close associations with emergency response organizations through its representation on the executive committee of cga and the board of directors of osr 

  

the corporation continues to participate in a number of industrywide task forces that are studying better ways to assess the risk of and prevent onshore and offshore incidents access and control blowouts in subsea environments and improve containment and recovery methods the task forces are working closely with the oil and gas industry and international government agencies to implement improvements and increase the effectiveness of oil spill prevention preparedness response and recovery processes 

insurance coverage and indemnification 

the corporation maintains insurance coverage that includes coverage for physical damage to its property third party liability workers’ compensation and employers’ liability general liability sudden and accidental pollution and other coverage this insurance coverage is subject to deductibles exclusions and limitations and there is no assurance that such coverage will adequately protect the corporation against liability from all potential consequences and damages 

the amount of insurance covering physical damage to the corporation’s property and liability related to negative environmental effects resulting from a sudden and accidental pollution event excluding atlantic named windstorm coverage for which it is selfinsured varies by asset based on the asset’s estimated replacement value or the estimated maximum loss in the case of a catastrophic event first party coverage consists of two tiers of insurance the first 300 million of coverage is provided through an industry mutual insurance group above this 300 million threshold insurance is carried which ranges in value up to 225 billion in total depending on the asset coverage level as described above additionally the corporation carries insurance which provides third party coverage for general liability and sudden and accidental pollution up to 1 billion 

other insurance policies provide coverage for among other things charterer’s legal liability in the amount of 500 million per occurrence and aircraft liability in the amount of 300 million per occurrence 

the corporation’s insurance policies renew at various dates each year future insurance coverage could increase in cost and may include higher deductibles or retentions or additional exclusions or limitations in addition some forms of insurance may become unavailable in the future or unavailable on terms that are deemed economically acceptable 

generally the corporation’s drilling contracts and most of its other offshore services contracts provide for a mutual hold harmless indemnity structure whereby each party to the contract the corporation and contractor indemnifies the other party for injuries or damages to their personnel and property and often those of its contractorssubcontractors regardless of fault variations may include indemnity exclusions to the extent a claim is attributable to the gross negligence andor willful misconduct of a party thirdparty claims on the other hand are generally allocated on a fault basis 

the corporation is customarily responsible for and indemnifies the contractor against all claims including those from thirdparties to the extent attributable to pollution or contamination by substances originating from its reservoirs or other property regardless of fault including gross negligence and willful misconduct and the contractor is responsible for and indemnifies the corporation for all claims attributable to pollution emanating from the contractor’s property additionally the corporation is generally liable for all of its own losses and most thirdparty claims associated with catastrophic losses such as blowouts cratering and loss of hole regardless of cause although exceptions for losses attributable to gross negligence andor willful misconduct do exist lastly many offshore services contracts include overall limitations of the contractor’s liability equal to the value of the contract or a fixed amount 

under a standard joint operating agreement joa each party is liable for all claims arising under the joa not covered by or in excess of insurance carried by the joa to the extent of its participating interest operator or nonoperator variations include indemnity exclusions when the claim is based upon the gross negligence andor willful misconduct of a party in which case such party is solely liable however under some production sharing contracts between a governmental entity and commercial parties liability of the commercial parties to the governmental entity is joint and several

 item 1a risk factors related to our business and operations 

our business activities and the value of our securities are subject to significant risk factors including those described below the risk factors described below could negatively affect our operations financial condition liquidity and results of operations and as a result holders and purchasers of our securities could lose part or all of their investments it is possible that additional risks relating to our securities may be described in a prospectus supplement if we issue securities in the future 

our business and operating results are highly dependent on the market prices of crude oil natural gas refined petroleum products and electricity which can be very volatile our estimated proved reserves revenue operating cash flows operating margins future earnings and trading operations are highly dependent on the prices of crude oil natural gas refined petroleum products and electricity which are volatile and influenced by numerous factors beyond our control changes in commodity prices can also have a material impact on collateral and margin requirements under our derivative contracts the major foreign oil producing countries including members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec exert considerable influence over the supply and price of crude oil and refined petroleum products their ability or inability to agree on a common policy on rates of production and other matters has a significant impact on the oil markets the commodities trading markets as well as other supply and demand factors may also influence the selling prices of crude oil natural gas refined petroleum products and electricity to the extent that we engage in hedging activities to mitigate commodity price volatility we may not realize the benefit of price increases above the hedged price in order to manage the potential volatility of cash flows and credit requirements the corporation utilizes significant bank credit facilities an inability to renew or replace such credit facilities or access other sources of funding as they mature would negatively impact our liquidity 

if we fail to successfully increase our reserves our future crude oil and natural gas production will be adversely impacted we own or have access to a finite amount of oil and gas reserves which will be depleted over time replacement of oil and gas production and reserves including proved undeveloped reserves is subject to successful exploration drilling development activities and enhanced recovery programs therefore future oil and gas production is dependent on technical success in finding and developing additional hydrocarbon reserves exploration activity involves the interpretation of seismic and other geological and geophysical data which does not always successfully predict the presence of commercial quantities of hydrocarbons drilling risks include unexpected adverse conditions irregularities in pressure or formations equipment failure blowouts and weather interruptions future developments may be affected by unforeseen reservoir conditions which negatively affect recovery factors or flow rates the costs of drilling and development activities have increased in recent years which could negatively affect expected economic returns reserve replacement can also be achieved through acquisition similar risks however may be encountered in the production of oil and gas on properties acquired from others 

there are inherent uncertainties in estimating quantities of proved reserves and discounted future net cash flows and actual quantities may be lower than estimated numerous uncertainties exist in estimating quantities of proved reserves and future net revenues from those reserves actual future production oil and gas prices revenues taxes capital expenditures operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates and could materially affect the estimated quantities of our proved reserves and the related future net revenues in addition reserve estimates may be subject to downward or upward changes based on production performance purchases or sales of properties 

  

results of future development prevailing oil and gas prices production sharing contracts which may decrease reserves as crude oil and natural gas prices increase and other factors 

we do not always control decisions made under joint operating agreements and the partners under such agreements may fail to meet their obligations we conduct many of our exploration and production operations under joint operating agreements in which we may share control with other parties to the agreement there is a risk that these parties may at any time have economic business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours or these parties may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone if we fail to jointly control operations business decisions and other actions the value of our investment may be adversely affected 

we are subject to changing laws and regulations and other governmental actions that can significantly and adversely affect our business federal state local territorial and foreign laws and regulations relating to tax increases and retroactive tax claims disallowance of tax credits and deductions expropriation or nationalization of property mandatory government participation cancellation or amendment of contract rights and changes in import and export regulations limitations on access to exploration and development opportunities as well as other political developments may affect our operations as a result of the accident in april 2010 at the bp plc bp operated macondo prospect in the gulf of mexico in which the corporation was not a participant and the ensuing significant oil spill a temporary drilling moratorium was imposed in the gulf of mexico while this moratorium has since been lifted significant new regulations have been imposed and further legislation and regulations may be proposed the new regulatory environment has resulted in a longer permitting process and higher costs the doddfrank wall street reform act enacted in 2010 doddfrank act delegated rulemaking responsibilities to carry out the act to various us government agencies our business could potentially be adversely impacted by one or more of the final rules under this act including potential additional costs to engage in certain derivative transactions on august 22 2012 the securities and exchange commission issued final rules as required by the doddfrank act regarding disclosure of payments by resource extraction issuers pursuant to which beginning in 2014 we will be required to provide information about payments made to governments for the commercial development of oil natural gas or minerals 

political instability in areas where we operate can adversely affect our business some of the international areas in which we operate and the partners with whom we operate are politically less stable than other areas and partners political unrest in north africa and the middle east has affected and may affect our operations in these areas as well as oil and gas markets generally the threat of terrorism around the world also poses additional risks to the operations of the oil and gas industry 

our oil and gas operations are subject to environmental risks and environmental laws and regulations that can result in significant costs and liabilities our oil and gas operations like those of the industry are subject to environmental risks such as oil spills produced water spills gas leaks and ruptures and discharges of substances or gases that could expose us to substantial liability for pollution or other environmental damage for example the accident at the bp operated macondo prospect in april 2010 resulted in a significant release of crude oil which caused extensive environmental and economic damage our operations are also subject to numerous united states federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations noncompliance with these laws and regulations may subject us to administrative civil or criminal penalties remedial cleanups and natural resource damages or other liabilities in addition increasingly stringent environmental regulations have resulted and will likely continue to result in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us and the oil and gas industry in general 

concerns have been raised in certain jurisdictions where we have operations concerning the safety and environmental impact of the drilling and development of unconventional oil and gas resources particularly hydraulic fracturing water usage flaring of associated natural gas and air emissions while we believe that these operations can be conducted safely and with minimal impact on the environment regulatory bodies are responding to these concerns and may impose moratoriums and new regulations on such drilling operations that would likely have the effect of prohibiting or delaying such operations and increasing their cost for example a moratorium prohibiting hydraulic fracturing is currently impacting the corporation’s operations in france 

concerns about climate change may result in significant operational changes and expenditures and reduced demand for our products we recognize that climate change is a global environmental concern continuing political and social attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national regional or local legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions these agreements and measures may require significant equipment modifications operational changes taxes or purchase of emission credits to reduce emission of greenhouse gases from our operations which may result in substantial capital expenditures and compliance operating maintenance and remediation costs in addition we market petroleum fuels which through normal customer use result in the emission of 

  

greenhouse gases regulatory initiatives to reduce the use of these fuels may reduce our sales of and revenues from these products finally to the extent that climate change may result in more extreme weather related events we could experience increased costs related to prevention maintenance and remediation of affected operations in addition to higher costs and lost revenues related to delays and shutdowns 

our industry is highly competitive and many of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than we have the petroleum industry is highly competitive and very capital intensive we encounter competition from numerous companies in each of our activities including acquiring rights to explore for crude oil and natural gas and in purchasing and marketing of refined petroleum products natural gas and electricity many competitors including national oil companies are larger and have substantially greater resources we are also in competition with producers and marketers of other forms of energy increased competition for worldwide oil and gas assets has significantly increased the cost of acquisitions in addition competition for drilling services technical expertise and equipment may affect the availability of technical personnel and drilling rigs resulting in increased capital and operating costs 

catastrophic events whether naturally occurring or manmade may materially affect our operations and financial conditions our oil and gas operations are subject to unforeseen occurrences which have affected us from time to time and which may damage or destroy assets interrupt operations and have other significant adverse effects examples of catastrophic risks include hurricanes fires explosions blowouts such as the accident at the macondo prospect pipeline interruptions and ruptures severe weather geological events labor disputes or cyberattacks during 2012 we incurred charges for repairs and other expenses relating to the effects of hurricane sandy which hit the northeast coast of the united states although we maintain insurance coverage against property and casualty losses there can be no assurance that such insurance will adequately protect the corporation against liability from all potential consequences and damages moreover some forms of insurance may be unavailable in the future or be available only on terms that are deemed economically unacceptable 










 item 3 legal proceedings 

the corporation along with many other companies engaged in refining and marketing of gasoline has been a party to lawsuits and claims related to the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe in gasoline a series of similar lawsuits many involving water utilities or governmental entities were filed in jurisdictions across the united states against producers of mtbe and petroleum refiners who produced gasoline containing mtbe including the corporation the principal allegation in all cases was that gasoline containing mtbe is a defective product and that these parties are strictly liable in proportion to their share of the gasoline market for damage to groundwater resources and are required to take remedial action to ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of releases of mtbe in 2008 the majority of the cases against the corporation were settled in 2010 and 2011 additional cases were settled including an action brought in state court by the state of new hampshire two separate cases brought by the state of new jersey and the commonwealth of puerto rico remain unresolved in 2007 a pretax charge of 40 million was recorded to cover all of the known mtbe cases against the corporation 

the corporation received a directive from the new jersey department of environmental protection njdep to remediate contamination in the sediments of the lower passaic river and the njdep is also seeking natural resource damages the directive insofar as it affects the corporation relates to alleged releases from a petroleum bulk storage terminal in newark new jersey now owned by the corporation the corporation and over 70 companies entered into an administrative order on consent with the environmental protection agency epa to study the same contamination the njdep has also sued several other companies linked to a facility considered by the state to be the largest contributor to river contamination in january 2009 these companies added third party defendants including the corporation to that case in june 2007 the epa issued a draft study which evaluated six alternatives for early action with costs ranging from 900 million to 23 billion for all parties based on adverse comments from the corporation and others the epa is reevaluating its alternatives in addition the federal trustees for natural resources have begun a separate assessment of damages to natural resources in the passaic river given the ongoing studies remedial costs cannot be reliably estimated at this time based on currently known facts and circumstances the corporation does not believe that this matter will result in a material liability because its terminal could not have contributed contamination along most of the river’s length and did not store or use contaminants which are of the greatest concern in the river sediments and because there are numerous other parties who will likely share in the cost of remediation and damages 

on july 25 2011 the virgin islands department of planning and natural resources commenced an enforcement action against hovensa by issuance of documents titled “notice of violation order for corrective action notice of assessment of civil penalty notice of opportunity for hearing” the “novs” the novs assert violations of virgin islands air pollution control laws and regulations arising out of odor 

  

incidents on st croix in may 2011 and proposes total penalties of 210000 hovensa believes that it has good defenses against the asserted violations 

in july 2004 hess oil virgin islands corp hovic a wholly owned subsidiary of the corporation and hovensa each received a letter from the commissioner of the virgin islands department of planning and natural resources and natural resources trustees advising of the trustee’s intention to bring suit against hovic and hovensa under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla the letter alleges that hovic and hovensa are potentially responsible for damages to natural resources arising from releases of hazardous substances from the hovensa refinery which had been operated by hovic until october 1998 an action was filed on may 5 2005 in the district court of the virgin islands against hovensa hovic and other companies that operated industrial facilities on the south shore of st croix asserting that the defendants are liable under cercla and territorial statutory and common law for damages to natural resources hovic and hovensa are continuing to vigorously defend this matter and do not believe that this matter will result in a material liability as they believe that they have strong defenses against this complaint 

the corporation periodically receives notices from the epa that it is a “potential responsible party” under the superfund legislation with respect to various waste disposal sites under this legislation all potentially responsible parties are jointly and severally liable for certain sites the epa’s claims or assertions of liability against the corporation relating to these sites have not been fully developed with respect to the remaining sites the epa’s claims have been settled or a proposed settlement is under consideration in all cases for amounts that are not material the ultimate impact of these proceedings and of any related proceedings by private parties on the business or accounts of the corporation cannot be predicted at this time due to the large number of other potentially responsible parties and the speculative nature of cleanup cost estimates but is not expected to be material 

the corporation is from time to time involved in other judicial and administrative proceedings including proceedings relating to other environmental matters the corporation cannot predict with certainty if how or when such proceedings will be resolved or what the eventual relief if any may be particularly for proceedings that are in their early stages of development or where plaintiffs seek indeterminate damages numerous issues may need to be resolved including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters before a loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated for any proceeding subject to the foregoing in management’s opinion based upon currently known facts and circumstances the outcome of such proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition results of operations or cash flows of the corporation

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

hess corporation and its subsidiaries the corporation or hess operate in two segments exploration and production ep and marketing and refining mr the corporation has made significant progress in its transformation from an integrated oil and gas company to a predominantly ep company following the shutdown of the hovensa llc hovensa joint venture refinery in january 2012 and its decision in january 2013 to cease refining operations at its port reading facility and pursue the sale of its terminal network following these actions over 90 percent of the corporation’s capital employed will be in its ep segment the corporation also has shifted its ep growth strategy from one based primarily on high impact exploration to one based on a combination of the development of unconventional resources exploitation of existing discoveries and a smaller more focused exploratory program the corporation intends to continue to pursue its strategy of transforming itself into an essentially ep business focused on the corporation’s most promising properties and operations 

on january 29 2013 elliott management corporation elliott sent a letter to hess shareholders informing them that affiliates of elliott beneficially own 4 percent of the outstanding common stock of the corporation and are nominating five individuals for election as directors at the corporation’s 2013 annual meeting among other things elliott stated its view that hess should 1 spin off the corporation’s bakken assets along with the eagle ford and utica acreage 2 divest the corporation’s downstream assets and place midstream assets into a master limited partnership mlp or real estate investment trust reit structure and 3 divest assets from the corporation’s remaining international portfolio the corporation is in the process of reviewing elliott’s proposals with the board and its advisors and intends to respond in the near future 

net income in 2012 was 2025 million compared with 1703 million in 2011 and 2125 million in 2010 diluted earnings per share were 595 in 2012 compared with 501 in 2011 and 647 in 2010 a table of items affecting comparability of earnings between periods is shown on page 22 

exploration and production 

the corporation’s total proved reserves were 1553 million barrels of oil equivalent boe at december 31 2012 compared with 1573 million boe at december 31 2011 and 1537 million boe at december 31 2010 

ep earnings were 2212 million in 2012 2675 million in 2011 and 2736 million in 2010 excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods ep net income was 2256 million 2431 million and 2004 million for 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively average realized crude oil selling prices were 8694 per barrel in 2012 8999 in 2011 and 6620 in 2010 including the impact of hedging average realized natural gas selling prices were 616 per mcf in 2012 596 in 2011 and 563 in 2010 production averaged 406000 barrels of oil equivalent per day boepd in 2012 370000 boepd in 2011 and 418000 boepd in 2010 the corporation currently expects total worldwide production to average between 375000 boepd and 390000 boepd in 2013 this forecast assumes russian operations remain in the portfolio for the full year 

the following is an update of significant ep activities during 2012 

 

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

 marketing and refining 

results from mr activities were earnings of 231 million in 2012 a loss of 584 million in 2011 and a loss of 231 million in 2010 excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods mr earnings were 160 million in 2012 a loss of 59 million in 2011 and earnings of 58 million in 2010 in january 2012 hovensa shut down its refinery in st croix us virgin islands the corporation and its joint venture partner plan to pursue the sale of hovensa while the complex is operated as an oil storage terminal in january 2013 the corporation announced its decision to cease refining operations in february at its port reading facility and pursue the sale of its terminal network 

liquidity and capital and exploratory expenditures 

net cash provided by operating activities was 5660 million in 2012 4984 million in 2011 and 4530 million in 2010 at december 31 2012 cash and cash equivalents totaled 642 million an increase from 351 million at december 31 2011 total debt was 8111 million at december 31 2012 and 6057 million at december 31 2011 the corporation’s debt to capitalization ratio at december 31 2012 was 277 compared with 246 at the end of 2011 

capital and exploratory expenditures were as follows 

 

  

 

the corporation anticipates investing 68 billion in capital and exploratory expenditures in 2013 substantially all of which is targeted for ep operations 

  

consolidated results of operations 

the aftertax income loss by major operating activity is summarized below 

 

  

 

the following table summarizes on an aftertax basis items of income expense that are included in net income and affect comparability between periods the items in the table below are explained on pages 25 through 27 

 

  

 

in the following discussion and elsewhere in this report the financial effects of certain transactions are disclosed on an aftertax basis management reviews segment earnings on an aftertax basis and uses aftertax amounts in its review of variances in segment earnings management believes that aftertax amounts are a preferable method of explaining variances in earnings since they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only the pretax amount aftertax amounts are determined by applying the income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pretax amounts 

comparison of results 

exploration and production 

following is a summarized income statement of the corporation’s ep operations 

 

  

 

 

   

after considering the ep items affecting comparability of earnings between periods in the table on page 25 the remaining changes in ep earnings are primarily attributable to changes in selling prices production and sales volumes operating costs depreciation depletion and amortization exploration expenses and income taxes as discussed below 

selling prices lower average realized selling prices primarily from crude oil and natural gas liquids decreased ep revenues by approximately 380 million in 2012 compared with the corresponding period in 2011 higher average selling prices increased ep revenues by approximately 2400 million in 2011 compared with 2010 

the corporation’s average selling prices were as follows 

 

  

 

in october 2008 the corporation closed brent crude oil hedges covering 24000 barrels per day from 2009 through 2012 by entering into offsetting contracts with the same counterparty the deferred aftertax losses as of the date the hedge positions were closed were recorded in earnings as the contracts matured the corporation also entered into brent crude oil hedges using fixedprice swap contracts to hedge 120000 boepd of crude oil sales volumes for the full year of 2012 at an average price of 10770 per barrel crude oil hedges reduced ep earnings by 431 million 688 million before income taxes in 2012 327 million 517 million before income taxes in 2011 and 338 million 533 million before income taxes in 2010 both of these hedge programs matured as of december 31 2012 in january and february 2013 the corporation entered into brent crude oil hedges using fixedprice swap contracts to hedge 90000 boepd of crude oil sales volumes for the remainder of the calendar year at an average price of approximately 10970 per barrel 

production and sales volumes the corporation’s crude oil and natural gas production was 406000 boepd in 2012 370000 boepd in 2011 and 418000 boepd in 2010 approximately 75 in 2012 72 in 2011 and 73 in 2010 of the corporation’s production was from crude oil and natural gas liquids the corporation currently expects total worldwide production to average between 375000 boepd and 390000 boepd in 2013 this forecast assumes russian operations remain in the portfolio for the full year 

  

the corporation’s net daily worldwide production was as follows 

 

  

 

 

 united states crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas production in the united states was higher in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to new wells in the bakken oil shale play in the second quarter of 2012 production restarted from a well at the llano field after a successful workover of the well which had been shutin for mechanical reasons since the first quarter of 2011 crude oil production was higher in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to new wells in the bakken oil shale play partly offset by lower production due to the shutin well at the llano field natural gas production was lower in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to this shutin well at the llano field 

europe crude oil production in 2012 was lower than 2011 primarily due to downtime at the valhall field in norway which was shutin from midjuly 2012 until january 2013 in order to complete a field redevelopment project crude oil production in 2011 was comparable to 2010 as higher production from norway and russia was largely offset by lower production from the corporation’s united kingdom north sea assets natural gas production was lower in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to the sale of the snohvit field offshore norway in january 2012 downtime at the valhall field as noted above and natural decline at the beryl field in the united kingdom north sea natural gas production was lower in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to the sale in february 2011 of certain natural gas producing assets in the united kingdom north sea 

  

africa crude oil production increased in 2012 compared with 2011 mainly due to the resumption of production in libya partly offset by lower production in equatorial guinea due to downtime and natural field decline following the lifting of the economic sanctions imposed in response to civil unrest the corporation’s production in libya resumed during the fourth quarter of 2011 after being shutin from the first quarter of 2011 crude oil production decreased in 2011 compared with 2010 due to the suspension of production in libya the exchange in september 2010 of the corporation’s interests in gabon for increased interests in norway lower production entitlement in equatorial guinea and algeria as a result of higher selling prices and natural decline in equatorial guinea 

asia and other natural gas production in 2012 was higher than 2011 primarily due to new wells at the pangkah field in indonesia and a full year’s contribution from the gajah baru complex at the natuna a field in indonesia which commenced production in the fourth quarter of 2011 natural gas production in 2011 was higher than 2010 primarily due to higher nominations at block pm301 in malaysia and first production from the gajah baru complex 

sales volumes higher sales volumes and other operating revenues increased revenue by approximately 1225 million in 2012 compared with 2011 and lower sales volumes and other operating revenues decreased revenue by approximately 1100 million in 2011 compared with 2010 

operating costs and depreciation depletion and amortization cash operating costs consisting of production expenses and general and administrative expenses increased by 401 million in 2012 compared with 2011 and increased by 460 million in 2011 compared with 2010 the increase in 2012 reflects higher production taxes as a result of increased production volumes at the bakken oil shale play and in russia together with higher operating and maintenance costs at the valhall field in norway the llano field in the united states and the bakken the increase in costs in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to higher production taxes as a result of higher selling prices together with higher operating and maintenance expenses mainly in norway and the bakken 

depreciation depletion and amortization charges increased by 548 million in 2012 and 83 million in 2011 compared with the corresponding amounts in prior years the increase in 2012 was primarily due to higher volumes and per barrel costs the increase in 2011 was primarily due to higher per barrel costs reflecting higher finding and development costs in addition the higher per barrel rates in 2012 and 2011 were largely due to greater production contribution from unconventional assets 

excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods cash operating costs per barrel of oil equivalent were 2063 in 2012 1971 in 2011 and 1445 in 2010 depreciation depletion and amortization costs per barrel of oil equivalent were 1920 in 2012 1706 in 2011 and 1456 in 2010 for 2013 cash operating costs are estimated to be in the range of 2100 to 2200 per barrel and depreciation depletion and amortization costs are estimated to be in the range of 1900 to 2000 per barrel resulting in total unit costs of 4000 to 4200 per barrel of oil equivalent 

exploration expenses exploration expenses decreased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to lower dry hole expenses and lease amortization dry hole expenses in 2012 included amounts associated with two exploration wells ness deep in the gulf of mexico and ajek1 offshore indonesia exploration expenses increased in 2011 from 2010 mainly due to higher dry hole expenses which included amounts relating to two exploration wells on the semai v block offshore indonesia and a well in the north red sea block 1 offshore egypt 

income taxes excluding the impact of items affecting comparability of earnings between periods the effective income tax rates for ep operations were 45 in 2012 38 in 2011 and 44 in 2010 the increase in the effective income tax rate in 2012 compared with 2011 was predominantly due to the resumption of libyan operations the effective income tax rate for ep operations in 2013 is estimated to be in the range of 46 to 50

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table sets forth certain relevant measures of the corporation’s liquidity and capital resources at december 31 

 

  

 

 

 cash flows 

the following table sets forth a summary of the corporation’s cash flows 

 

  

 

operating activities  net cash provided by operating activities amounted to 5660 million in 2012 compared with 4984 million in 2011 reflecting higher operating earnings and increases in cash flows from changes in working capital operating cash flow increased to 4984 million in 2011 from 4530 million in 2010 principally reflecting higher operating earnings partially offset by a decrease in cash flows from changes in working capital 

investing activities the following table summarizes the corporation’s capital expenditures 

 

  

 

the increased spend on capital expenditures in 2012 primarily reflected additional spending at the bakken oil shale play as a result of drilling new wells higher working interest wells and increased spending on field infrastructure projects capital expenditures in 2011 included acquisitions of approximately 800 million for 195000 net acres in the utica shale play in ohio 214 million for interests in two blocks in the kurdistan region of iraq and 116 million for an additional 4 interest in the south arne field in denmark capital expenditures in 2010 included acquisitions of 167000 net acres in the bakken oil shale play in north dakota from trz energy llc for 1075 million in cash and additional interests of 8 and 13 in the valhall and hod fields respectively for 507 million in cash 

the corporation received total proceeds from the sale of assets in the ep segment of 843 million in 2012 490 million in 2011 and 183 million in 2010 

financing activities during 2012 the corporation borrowed a net of 1845 million from available credit facilities which consisted of borrowings of 758 million from its syndicated revolving credit facility 890 million from its shortterm credit facilities and 250 million from its assetbacked credit facility partially offset 

  

by net repayments of other debt of 53 million during 2011 net proceeds from borrowings on available credit facilities were 422 million during 2010 net proceeds from borrowings were 1098 million including the august 2010 issuance of 1250 million of 30year fixedrate public notes with a coupon of 56 scheduled to mature in 2041 in january 2010 the corporation completed the repurchase of the remaining 116 million of fixedrate public notes that were scheduled to mature in 2011 

total common stock dividends paid were 171 million in 2012 136 million in 2011 and 131 million in 2010 in 2012 the corporation made five quarterly common stock dividend payments as a result of accelerating payment of the fourth quarter 2012 dividend which historically would have been paid in the first quarter of 2013 the corporation received net proceeds from the exercise of stock options including related income tax benefits of 11 million 88 million and 54 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

future capital requirements and resources 

the corporation anticipates investing a total of approximately 68 billion in capital and exploratory expenditures during 2013 substantially all of which is targeted for ep operations this reflects an 18 percent reduction from the 2012 total of 83 billion the decrease is substantially attributable to a reduced level of spend in the bakken driven by lower drilling and completion costs and decreased investments in infrastructure projects 

during 2012 the corporation funded its capital spending through cash flows from operations incremental borrowings and proceeds from asset sales the corporation had a cash flow deficit of approximately 25 billion in 2012 and the projected deficit for 2013 is expected to moderate versus 2012 based on current commodity prices during 2012 the corporation announced asset sales totaling 24 billion of which cash proceeds of 843 million were received in 2012 and approximately 440 million were received in january 2013 the corporation is also pursuing the sale of its russian operations eagle ford assets and its terminal network the corporation expects to fund its 2013 capital expenditures and ongoing operations including dividends pension contributions and debt repayments with existing cash onhand cash flows from operations and proceeds from asset sales 

crude oil and natural gas prices are volatile and difficult to predict in addition unplanned increases in the corporation’s capital expenditure program could occur if conditions were to change such as a significant decrease in commodity prices or an unexpected increase in capital expenditures the corporation would take steps to protect its financial flexibility and may pursue other sources of liquidity including the issuance of debt securities the issuance of equity securities andor further asset sales

accounting policies 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

accounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of assets and liabilities in the corporation’s consolidated balance sheet and revenues and expenses in the statement of consolidated income the accounting methods used can affect net income equity and various financial statement ratios however the corporation’s accounting policies generally do not change cash flows or liquidity 

accounting for exploration and development costs ep activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage including lease bonuses brokers’ fees and other related costs are capitalized annual lease rentals exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred costs of drilling and equipping productive wells including development dry holes and related production facilities are capitalized in production operations costs of injected co 2 for tertiary recovery are expensed as incurred 

the costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if 1 the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and 2 sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operational viability of the project if either of those criteria is not met or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project the capitalized well costs are charged to expense indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves and the economic and operating viability of a project include commitment of project personnel active negotiations for sales contracts with customers negotiations with governments operators and contractors and firm plans for additional drilling and other factors 

crude oil and natural gas reserves the determination of estimated proved reserves is a significant element in arriving at the results of operations of exploration and production activities the estimates of proved reserves affect well capitalizations the unit of production depreciation rates of proved properties and wells and equipment as well as impairment testing of oil and gas assets and goodwill 

for reserves to be booked as proved they must be determined with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations in addition government and project operator approvals must be obtained and depending on the amount of the project cost senior management or the board of directors must commit to fund the project the corporation maintains its own internal reserve estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work directly with the oil and gas properties the corporation’s technical staff updates reserve estimates throughout the year based on evaluations of new wells performance reviews new technical data and other studies to provide consistency throughout the corporation standard reserve estimation guidelines definitions reporting reviews and approval practices are used the internal reserve estimates are subject to internal technical audits and senior 

  

management review the corporation also engages an independent third party consulting firm to audit approximately 80 of the corporation’s total proved reserves 

impairment of longlived assets and goodwill as explained below there are significant differences in the way longlived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing the corporation reviews longlived assets including oil and gas fields for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered longlived assets are tested based on identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities if the carrying amounts of the longlived assets are not expected to be recovered by undiscounted future net cash flow estimates the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded the amount of impairment is based on the estimated fair value of the assets generally determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows an income valuation approach or by a marketbased valuation approach which are level 3 fair value measurements 

in the case of oil and gas fields the present value of future net cash flows is based on management’s best estimate of future prices which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices applied to projected production volumes and discounted at a riskadjusted rate the projected production volumes represent reserves including probable reserves expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures 

the production volumes prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairments will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows since the standardized measure requires the use of historical twelve month average prices 

the corporation’s impairment tests of longlived ep producing assets are based on its best estimates of future production volumes including recovery factors selling prices operating and capital costs the timing of future production and other factors which are updated each time an impairment test is performed the corporation could have impairments if the projected production volumes from oil and gas fields decrease crude oil and natural gas selling prices decline significantly for an extended period or future estimated capital and operating costs increase significantly 

the corporation’s goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable the goodwill test is conducted at a reporting unit level which is defined in accounting standards as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment the reporting unit or units to be used in an evaluation and measurement of goodwill for impairment testing are determined from a number of factors including the manner in which the business is managed the corporation has concluded that the ep segment is the reporting unit for the purposes of testing goodwill for impairment since the ep segment is managed globally by one segment manager who allocates financial and technical resources globally and reviews operating results at the segment level accordingly the corporation expects that the benefits of goodwill will be recovered through the operations of that segment 

if any of the ep segment components such as our financial reporting regions united states europe africa and asia were considered to be reporting units an analysis would be performed to determine if these components were economically similar as defined in the accounting standard for goodwill asc 3502035 if components are economically similar that guidance requires that those components be aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit 

while the corporation believes that the ep segment is the reporting unit because of the manner in which the business is managed it also evaluated the required aggregation criteria specified in the accounting standard for segment reporting asc 280105011 and determined that its components are economically similar for the following reasons 

 

      if the corporation reorganized its exploration and production business such that there was more than one reporting unit goodwill may be assigned to two or more reporting units 

the corporation’s fair value estimate of the ep segment is the sum of 1 the discounted anticipated cash flows of producing assets and known developments 2 the estimated risk adjusted present value of exploration assets and 3 an estimated market premium to reflect the market price an acquirer would pay for potential 

  

synergies including cost savings access to new business opportunities enterprise control improved processes and increased market share the corporation also considers the relative market valuation of similar ep companies 

the determination of the fair value of the ep segment depends on estimates about oil and gas reserves future prices timing of future net cash flows and market premiums significant extended declines in crude oil and natural gas prices or reduced reserve estimates could lead to a decrease in the fair value of the ep segment that could result in an impairment of goodwill 

as there are significant differences in the way longlived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing there may be impairments of individual assets that would not cause an impairment of the goodwill assigned to the ep segment 

income taxes judgments are required in the determination and recognition of income tax assets and liabilities in the financial statements these judgments include the requirement to only recognize the financial statement effect of a tax position when management believes that it is more likely than not that based on the technical merits the position will be sustained upon examination 

the corporation has net operating loss carryforwards or credit carryforwards in several jurisdictions including the united states and has recorded deferred tax assets for those losses and credits additionally the corporation has deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized in evaluating realizability of deferred tax assets the corporation refers to the reversal periods for available carryforward periods for net operating losses and credit carryforwards temporary differences the availability of tax planning strategies the existence of appreciated assets and estimates of future taxable income and other factors estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas reserves and selling prices that are consistent with the corporation’s internal business forecasts additionally the corporation has income taxes which have been deferred on intercompany transactions eliminated in consolidation related to transfers of property plant and equipment remaining within the consolidated group the amortization of these income taxes deferred on intercompany transactions will occur ratably with the recovery through depletion and depreciation of the carrying value of these assets the corporation does not provide for deferred us income taxes for that portion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations 

asset retirement obligations the corporation has material legal obligations to remove and dismantle long lived assets and to restore land or seabed at certain exploration and production locations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles the corporation recognizes a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations in addition the fair value of any legally required conditional asset retirement obligations is recorded if the liability can be reasonably estimated the corporation capitalizes such costs as a component of the carrying amount of the underlying assets in the period in which the liability is incurred in order to measure these obligations the corporation estimates the fair value of the obligations by discounting the future payments that will be required to satisfy the obligations in determining these estimates the corporation is required to make several assumptions and judgments related to the scope of dismantlement timing of settlement interpretation of legal requirements inflationary factors and discount rate in addition there are other external factors which could significantly affect the ultimate settlement costs for these obligations including changes in environmental regulations and other statutory requirements fluctuations in industry costs and foreign currency exchange rates and advances in technology as a result the corporation’s estimates of asset retirement obligations are subject to revision due to the factors described above changes in estimates prior to settlement result in adjustments to both the liability and related asset values 

retirement plans the corporation has funded noncontributory defined benefit pension plans and an unfunded supplemental pension plan the corporation recognizes in the consolidated balance sheet the net change in the funded status of the projected benefit obligation for these plans 

the determination of the obligations and expenses related to these plans are based on several actuarial assumptions the most significant of which relate to the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations expected longterm rates of return on plan assets and rate of future increases in compensation levels these assumptions represent estimates made by the corporation some of which can be affected by external factors for example the discount rate used to estimate the corporation’s projected benefit obligation is based on a portfolio of highquality fixed income debt instruments with maturities that approximate the expected payment of plan obligations while the expected return on plan assets is developed from the expected future 

  

returns for each asset category weighted by the target allocation of pension assets to that asset category changes in these assumptions can have a material impact on the amounts reported in the corporation’s financial statements 

derivatives the corporation utilizes derivative instruments for both risk management and trading activities in risk management activities the corporation uses futures forwards options and swaps individually or in combination to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in the prices of crude oil natural gas refined petroleum products and electricity as well as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates in trading activities the corporation principally through a consolidated partnership trades energyrelated commodities and derivatives including futures forwards options and swaps based on expectations of future market conditions 

all derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in the corporation’s consolidated balance sheet the corporation’s policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative the changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized currently in earnings derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions cash flow hedges or hedges of firm commitments fair value hedges the effective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income loss amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings the ineffective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recorded currently in earnings changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings the change in fair value of the related hedged commitment is recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized currently in earnings 

derivatives that are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges are tested for effectiveness prospectively before they are executed and both prospectively and retrospectively on an ongoing basis to determine whether they continue to qualify for hedge accounting the prospective and retrospective effectiveness calculations are performed using either historical simulation or other statistical models which utilize historical observable market data consisting of futures curves and spot prices 

fair value measurements the corporation’s derivative instruments are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings or other comprehensive income each period as appropriate the corporation uses various valuation approaches in determining fair value including the market and income approaches the corporation’s fair value measurements also include nonperformance risk and time value of money considerations counterparty credit is considered for receivable balances and the corporation’s credit is considered for accrued liabilities 

the corporation also records certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value when required by generally accepted accounting principles these fair value measurements are recorded in connection with business combinations qualifying nonmonetary exchanges the initial recognition of asset retirement obligations and any impairment of longlived assets equity method investments or goodwill 

the corporation determines fair value in accordance with the fair value measurements accounting standard which established a hierarchy for the inputs used to measure fair value based on the source of the inputs which generally range from quoted prices for identical instruments in a principal trading market level 1 to estimates determined using related market data level 3 measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered level 2 

when level 1 inputs are available within a particular market those inputs are selected for determination of fair value over level 2 or 3 inputs in the same market to value derivatives that are characterized as level 2 and 3 the corporation uses observable inputs for similar instruments that are available from exchanges pricing services or broker quotes these observable inputs may be supplemented with other methods including internal extrapolation or interpolation that result in the most representative prices for instruments with similar characteristics multiple inputs may be used to measure fair value however the level of fair value for each physical derivative and financial asset or liability is based on the lowest significant input level within this fair value hierarchy 

  

details on the methods and assumptions used to determine the fair values are as follows 

fair value measurements based on level 1 inputs measurements that are most observable are based on quoted prices of identical instruments obtained from the principal markets in which they are traded closing prices are both readily available and representative of fair value market transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to assure liquidity the fair value of certain of the corporation’s exchange traded futures and options are considered level 1 

fair value measurements based on level 2 inputs measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered level 2 measurements based on level 2 inputs include overthecounter derivative instruments that are priced on an exchange traded curve but have contractual terms that are not identical to exchange traded contracts the corporation utilizes fair value measurements based on level 2 inputs for certain forwards swaps and options 

fair value measurements based on level 3 inputs measurements that are least observable are estimated from related market data determined from sources with little or no market activity for comparable contracts or are positions with longer durations for example in its energy marketing business the corporation sells natural gas and electricity to customers and offsets the price exposure by purchasing forward contracts the fair value of these sales and purchases may be based on specific prices at less liquid delivered locations which are classified as level 3 fair values determined using discounted cash flows and other unobservable data are also classified as level 3 

impairment of equity investees the corporation reviews equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an other than temporary decline in value may have occurred the fair value measurement used in the impairment assessment is based on quoted market prices where available or other valuation techniques including discounted cash flows

emergency preparedness and response plans and procedures 

the corporation has in place a series of business and assetspecific emergency preparedness response and business continuity plans that detail procedures for rapid and effective emergency response and environmental mitigation activities these plans are risk appropriate and are maintained reviewed and updated as necessary to ensure their accuracy and suitability where appropriate they are also reviewed and approved by the relevant host government authorities 

responder training and drills are routinely held worldwide to assess and continually improve the effectiveness of the corporation’s plans the corporation’s contractors service providers representatives from government agencies and where applicable joint venture partners participate in the drills to ensure that emergency procedures are comprehensive and can be effectively implemented 

to complement internal capabilities and to ensure coverage for its global operations the corporation maintains membership contracts with a network of local regional and global oil spill response and emergency response organizations at the regional and global level these organizations include clean gulf associates helix well containment group hwcg marine well containment company mwcc wild well control national response corporation nrc and oil spill response osr clean gulf associates is a regional spill response organization and hwcg and mwcc both provide the equipment and personnel to contain an underwater well control incident in the gulf of mexico wild well control provides firefighting well control and engineering services globally nrc and osr are global response organizations and are available to assist the corporation when needed anywhere in the world in addition to owning response assets in their own right these organizations maintain business relationships that provide immediate access to additional critical response support services if required these owned response assets included nearly 300 recovery and storage vessels and barges more than 250 skimmers over 300000 feet of boom and significant quantities of dispersants and other ancillary equipment including aircraft if the corporation were to engage these organizations to obtain additional critical response support services it would fund such services and seek reimbursement under its insurance coverage described below in certain circumstances the corporation pursues and enters into mutual aid agreements with other companies and government cooperatives to receive and provide oil spill response equipment and personnel support the corporation maintains close associations with emergency response organizations through its representation on the executive committee of clean gulf associates and the board of directors of osr 

the corporation continues to participate in a number of industrywide task forces that are studying better ways to assess the risk of and prevent onshore and offshore incidents access and control blowouts in subsea environments and improve containment and recovery methods the task forces are working closely with the oil and gas industry and international government agencies to implement improvements and increase the effectiveness of oil spill prevention preparedness response and recovery processes 

insurance coverage and indemnification 

the corporation maintains insurance coverage that includes coverage for physical damage to its property third party liability workers’ compensation and employers’ liability general liability sudden and accidental pollution and other coverage this insurance coverage is subject to deductibles exclusions and limitations and there is no assurance that such coverage will adequately protect the corporation against liability from all potential consequences and damages 

the amount of insurance covering physical damage to the corporation’s property and liability related to negative environmental effects resulting from a sudden and accidental pollution event excluding windstorm coverage in the gulf of mexico for which it is self insured varies by asset based on the asset’s estimated replacement value or the estimated maximum loss in the case of a catastrophic event first party coverage consists of two tiers of insurance the first 250 million of coverage is provided through an industry mutual insurance group above this 250 million threshold insurance is carried which ranges in value to over 20 billion in total depending on the asset coverage level as described above additionally the corporation carries insurance which provides third party coverage for general liability and sudden and accidental pollution up to 1 billion beginning in 2012 the first layer of insurance coverage has been increased to 300 million and above that threshold insurance is carried which ranges in value to over 225 billion 

  

other insurance policies provide coverage for among other things charterer’s legal liability in the amount of 500 million per occurrence and aircraft liability in the amount of 300 million per occurrence 

the corporation’s insurance policies renew at various dates each year future insurance coverage for the industry could increase in cost and may include higher deductibles or retentions or additional exclusions or limitations in addition some forms of insurance may become unavailable in the future or unavailable on terms that are deemed economically acceptable 

generally the corporation’s drilling contracts and most of its other offshore services contracts provide for a mutual hold harmless indemnity structure whereby each party to the contract the corporation and contractor indemnifies the other party for injuries or damages to their personnel and property regardless of fault variations include indemnity exclusions to the extent a claim is attributable to the gross negligence andor willful misconduct of a party thirdparty claims on the other hand are generally allocated on a fault basis 

the corporation is customarily responsible for and indemnifies the contractor against all claims including those from thirdparties to the extent attributable to pollution or contamination by substances originating from its reservoirs or other property regardless of fault including gross negligence and willful misconduct and the contractor is responsible for and indemnifies the corporation for all claims attributable to pollution emanating from the contractor’s property additionally the corporation is generally liable for all of its own losses and most thirdparty claims associated with catastrophic losses such as blowouts cratering and loss of hole regardless of cause although exceptions for losses attributable to gross negligence andor willful misconduct do exist lastly many offshore services contracts include overall limitations of the contractor’s liability equal to the value of the contract or a fixed amount whichever is greater 

under a standard joint operating agreement joa each party is liable for all claims arising under the joa not covered by or in excess of insurance carried by the joa to the extent of its participating interest operator or nonoperator variations include indemnity exclusions where the claim is based upon the gross negligence andor willful misconduct of a party in which case such party is solely liable however under some production sharing contracts between a governmental entity and commercial parties liability of the commercial parties to the governmental entity is joint and several

 item 1a risk factors related to our business and operations 

our business activities and the value of our securities are subject to significant risk factors including those described below the risk factors described below could negatively affect our operations financial condition liquidity and results of operations and as a result holders and purchasers of our securities could lose part or all of their investments it is possible that additional risks relating to our securities may be described in a prospectus supplement if we issue securities in the future 

our business and operating results are highly dependent on the market prices of crude oil natural gas refined petroleum products and electricity which can be very volatile our estimated proved reserves revenue operating cash flows operating margins future earnings and trading operations are highly dependent on the prices of crude oil natural gas refined petroleum products and electricity which are volatile and influenced by numerous factors beyond our control changes in commodity prices can also have a material impact on collateral and margin requirements under our derivative contracts the major foreign oil producing countries including members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec exert considerable influence over the supply and price of crude oil and refined petroleum products their ability or inability to agree on a common policy on rates of production and other matters has a significant impact on the oil markets the commodities trading markets as well as other supply and demand factors may also influence the selling prices of crude oil natural gas refined petroleum products and electricity to the extent that we engage in hedging activities to mitigate commodity price volatility we may not realize the benefit of price increases above the hedged price in order to manage the potential volatility of cash flows and credit requirements the corporation utilizes significant bank credit facilities an inability to renew or replace such credit facilities or access other sources of funding as they mature would negatively impact our liquidity 

if we fail to successfully increase our reserves our future crude oil and natural gas production will be adversely impacted we own or have access to a finite amount of oil and gas reserves which will be depleted over time replacement of oil and gas production and reserves including proved undeveloped reserves is subject to successful exploration drilling development activities and enhanced recovery programs therefore future oil and gas production is dependent on technical success in finding and developing additional hydrocarbon reserves exploration activity involves the interpretation of seismic and other geological and geophysical data which does not always successfully predict the presence of commercial quantities of hydrocarbons drilling risks include unexpected adverse conditions irregularities in pressure or formations equipment failure blowouts and weather interruptions future developments may be affected by unforeseen reservoir conditions which negatively affect recovery factors or flow rates the costs of drilling and development activities have increased in recent years which could negatively affect expected economic returns reserve replacement can also be achieved through acquisition although due diligence is used in evaluating acquired oil and gas properties similar risks may be encountered in the production of oil and gas on properties acquired from others 

there are inherent uncertainties in estimating quantities of proved reserves and discounted future net cash flow and actual quantities may be lower than estimated numerous uncertainties exist in estimating quantities of proved reserves and future net revenues from those reserves actual future production oil and gas prices revenues taxes capital expenditures operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates and could materially affect the estimated quantities of our proved reserves and the related future net revenues in addition reserve estimates may be subject to downward or upward changes based on production performance purchases or sales of properties results of future development prevailing oil and gas prices production sharing contracts which may decrease reserves as crude oil and natural gas prices increase and other factors 

we are subject to changing laws and regulations and other governmental actions that can significantly and adversely affect our business federal state local territorial and foreign laws and regulations relating to tax increases and retroactive tax claims disallowance of tax credits and deductions expropriation or nationalization of property mandatory government participation cancellation or amendment of contract rights and changes in import and export regulations limitations on access to exploration and development opportunities as well as other political developments may affect our operations the doddfrank wall street reform act enacted in 2010 delegated rulemaking responsibilities to carry out the act to various us government agencies our business could potentially be adversely impacted by one or more of the final 

  

rules under this act when issued including potential additional costs to engage in certain derivative transactions we also market motor fuels through lesseedealers and wholesalers in certain states where legislation prohibits producers or refiners of crude oil from directly engaging in retail marketing of motor fuels similar legislation has been periodically proposed in various other states as a result of the accident in april 2010 at the bp plc bp operated macondo prospect in the gulf of mexico in which the corporation was not a participant and the ensuing significant oil spill a temporary drilling moratorium was imposed in the gulf of mexico while this moratorium has since been lifted significant new regulations have been imposed and further legislation and regulations may be proposed including an increase in the potential liability in the event of an oil spill the new regulatory environment has resulted in a longer permitting process and higher costs 

political instability in areas where we operate can adversely affect our business some of the international areas in which we operate and the partners with whom we operate are politically less stable than other areas and partners political unrest in north africa and the middle east has affected and may continue to affect our operations in these areas as well as oil and gas markets generally the threat of terrorism around the world also poses additional risks to the operations of the oil and gas industry 

our oil and gas operations are subject to environmental risks and environmental laws and regulations that can result in significant costs and liabilities our oil and gas operations like those of the industry are subject to environmental risks such as oil spills produced water spills gas leaks and ruptures and discharges of substances or gases that could expose us to substantial liability for pollution or other environmental damage for example the accident at the bp operated macondo prospect in april 2010 resulted in a significant release of crude oil which caused extensive environmental and economic damage our operations are also subject to numerous united states federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations noncompliance with these laws and regulations may subject us to administrative civil or criminal penalties remedial cleanups and natural resource damages or other liabilities in addition increasingly stringent environmental regulations particularly relating to the production of motor and other fuels have resulted and will likely continue to result in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us and the oil and gas industry in general 

concerns have been raised in certain jurisdictions where we have operations concerning the safety and environmental impact of the drilling and development of unconventional oil and gas resources particularly using the process of hydraulic fracturing while we believe that these operations can be conducted safely and with minimal impact on the environment regulatory bodies are responding to these concerns and may impose moratoriums and new regulations on such drilling operations that would likely have the effect of prohibiting or delaying such operations and increasing their cost for example a moratorium prohibiting hydraulic fracturing is currently impacting the corporation’s operations in france 

concerns about climate change may result in significant operational changes and expenditures and reduced demand for our products we recognize that climate change is a global environmental concern continuing political and social attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national regional or local legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions these agreements and measures may require significant equipment modifications operational changes taxes or purchase of emission credits to reduce emission of greenhouse gases from our operations which may result in substantial capital expenditures and compliance operating maintenance and remediation costs in addition we manufacture petroleum fuels which through normal customer use result in the emission of greenhouse gases regulatory initiatives to reduce the use of these fuels may reduce our sales of and revenues from these products finally to the extent that climate change may result in more extreme weather related events we could experience increased costs related to prevention maintenance and remediation of affected operations in addition to costs and lost revenues related to delays and shutdowns 

our industry is highly competitive and many of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than we have the petroleum industry is highly competitive and very capital intensive we encounter competition from numerous companies in each of our activities including acquiring rights to explore for crude oil and natural gas and in purchasing and marketing of refined petroleum products natural gas and electricity many competitors including national oil companies are larger and have substantially greater resources we are also in competition with producers and marketers of other forms of energy increased competition for worldwide oil and gas assets has significantly increased the cost of acquisitions in addition 

  

competition for drilling services technical expertise and equipment has in the recent past affected the availability of technical personnel and drilling rigs resulting in increased capital and operating costs 

catastrophic events whether naturally occurring or manmade may materially affect our operations and financial conditions our oil and gas operations are subject to unforeseen occurrences which have affected us from time to time and which may damage or destroy assets interrupt operations and have other significant adverse effects examples of catastrophic risks include hurricanes fires explosions and blowouts such as the accident at the macondo prospect operated by bp in the gulf of mexico in 2010 although we maintain insurance coverage against property and casualty losses there can be no assurance that such insurance will adequately protect the corporation against liability from all potential consequences and damages moreover some forms of insurance may be unavailable in the future or be available only on terms that are deemed economically unacceptable 










 item 3 legal proceedings 

the corporation along with many other companies engaged in refining and marketing of gasoline has been a party to lawsuits and claims related to the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe in gasoline a series of similar lawsuits many involving water utilities or governmental entities were filed in jurisdictions across the united states against producers of mtbe and petroleum refiners who produced gasoline containing mtbe including the corporation the principal allegation in all cases was that gasoline containing mtbe is a defective product and that these parties are strictly liable in proportion to their share of the gasoline market for damage to groundwater resources and are required to take remedial action to ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of releases of mtbe in 2008 the majority of the cases against the corporation were settled in 2010 and 2011 additional cases were settled including an action brought in state court by the state of new hampshire two separate cases brought by the state of new jersey and the commonwealth of puerto rico remain unresolved in 2007 a pretax charge of 40 million was recorded to cover all of the known mtbe cases against the corporation 

the corporation received a directive from the new jersey department of environmental protection njdep to remediate contamination in the sediments of the lower passaic river and the njdep is also seeking natural resource damages the directive insofar as it affects the corporation relates to alleged releases from a petroleum bulk storage terminal in newark new jersey now owned by the corporation the corporation and over 70 companies entered into an administrative order on consent with the environmental protection agency epa to study the same contamination the njdep has also sued several other companies linked to a facility considered by the state to be the largest contributor to river contamination in january 2009 these companies added third party defendants including the corporation to that case in june 2007 the epa issued a draft study which evaluated six alternatives for early action with costs ranging from 900 million to 23 billion for all parties based on adverse comments from the corporation and others the epa is reevaluating its alternatives in addition the federal trustees for natural resources have begun a separate assessment of damages to natural resources in the passaic river given the ongoing studies remedial costs cannot be reliably estimated at this time based on currently known facts and circumstances the corporation does not believe that this matter will result in a material liability because its terminal could not have contributed contamination along most of the river’s length and did not store or use contaminants which are of the greatest concern in the river sediments and because there are numerous other parties who will likely share in the cost of remediation and damages 

on july 25 2011 the virgin islands department of planning and natural resources commenced an enforcement action against hovensa by issuance of documents titled “notice of violation order for corrective action notice of assessment of civil penalty notice of opportunity for hearing” the “novs” the novs assert violations of virgin islands air pollution control laws and regulations arising out of odor incidents on st croix in may 2011 and proposes total penalties of 210000 hovensa is engaging in settlement discussions with the government of the virgin islands but believes that it has good defenses against the asserted violations 

on december 16 2010 the virgin islands department of planning and natural resources commenced four separate enforcement actions against hovensa by issuance of documents titled “notice of violation order for corrective action notice of assessment of civil penalty notice of opportunity for hearing” the novs assert violations of virgin islands air pollution control laws and regulations arising out of air release incidents 

  

at the hovensa refinery in 2009 and 2010 and propose total penalties of 1355000 hovensa anticipates settling this matter in the first quarter of 2012 

in july 2004 hess oil virgin islands corp hovic a wholly owned subsidiary of the corporation and hovensa each received a letter from the commissioner of the virgin islands department of planning and natural resources and natural resources trustees advising of the trustee’s intention to bring suit against hovic and hovensa under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla the letter alleges that hovic and hovensa are potentially responsible for damages to natural resources arising from releases of hazardous substances from the hovensa refinery which had been operated by hovic until october 1998 an action was filed on may 5 2005 in the district court of the virgin islands against hovensa hovic and other companies that operated industrial facilities on the south shore of st croix asserting that the defendants are liable under cercla and territorial statutory and common law for damages to natural resources hovic and hovensa are continuing to vigorously defend this matter and do not believe that this matter will result in a material liability as they believe that they have strong defenses against this complaint 

the corporation periodically receives notices from the epa that it is a “potential responsible party” under the superfund legislation with respect to various waste disposal sites under this legislation all potentially responsible parties are jointly and severally liable for certain sites the epa’s claims or assertions of liability against the corporation relating to these sites have not been fully developed with respect to the remaining sites the epa’s claims have been settled or a proposed settlement is under consideration in all cases for amounts that are not material the ultimate impact of these proceedings and of any related proceedings by private parties on the business or accounts of the corporation cannot be predicted at this time due to the large number of other potentially responsible parties and the speculative nature of cleanup cost estimates but is not expected to be material 

the corporation is from time to time involved in other judicial and administrative proceedings including proceedings relating to other environmental matters the corporation cannot predict with certainty if how or when such proceedings will be resolved or what the eventual relief if any may be particularly for proceedings that are in their early stages of development or where plaintiffs seek indeterminate damages numerous issues may need to be resolved including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters before a loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated for any proceeding subject to the foregoing in management’s opinion based upon currently known facts and circumstances the outcome of such proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition results of operations or cash flows of the corporation

accounting policies 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

accounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of assets and liabilities in the corporation’s consolidated balance sheet and revenues and expenses in the statement of consolidated income the accounting methods used can affect net income equity and various financial statement ratios however the corporation’s accounting policies generally do not change cash flows or liquidity 

accounting for exploration and development costs exploration and production activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage including lease bonuses brokers’ fees and other related costs are capitalized annual lease rentals exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred costs of drilling and equipping productive wells including development dry holes and related production facilities are capitalized in production operations costs of injected co 2 for tertiary recovery are expensed as incurred 

the costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if 1 the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and 

  

2 sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operational viability of the project if either of those criteria is not met or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project the capitalized well costs are charged to expense indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves and the economic and operating viability of a project include commitment of project personnel active negotiations for sales contracts with customers negotiations with governments operators and contractors and firm plans for additional drilling and other factors 

crude oil and natural gas reserves the sec revised its oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure requirements effective for yearend 2009 reporting in addition the financial accounting standards board fasb revised its accounting standard on oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosures the determination of estimated proved reserves is a significant element in arriving at the results of operations of exploration and production activities the estimates of proved reserves affect well capitalizations the unit of production depreciation rates of proved properties and wells and equipment as well as impairment testing of oil and gas assets and goodwill 

for reserves to be booked as proved they must be determined with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations in addition government and project operator approvals must be obtained and depending on the amount of the project cost senior management or the board of directors must commit to fund the project the corporation maintains its own internal reserve estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work directly with the oil and gas properties the corporation’s technical staff updates reserve estimates throughout the year based on evaluations of new wells performance reviews new technical data and other studies to provide consistency throughout the corporation standard reserve estimation guidelines definitions reporting reviews and approval practices are used the internal reserve estimates are subject to internal technical audits and senior management review the corporation also engages an independent third party consulting firm to audit approximately 80 of the corporation’s total proved reserves 

impairment of longlived assets and goodwill as explained below there are significant differences in the way longlived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing the corporation reviews longlived assets including oil and gas fields for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered longlived assets are tested based on identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities if the carrying amounts of the longlived assets are not expected to be recovered by undiscounted future net cash flow estimates the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded the amount of impairment is based on the estimated fair value of the assets generally determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows 

in the case of oil and gas fields the present value of future net cash flows is based on management’s best estimate of future prices which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices applied to projected production volumes and discounted at a riskadjusted rate the projected production volumes represent reserves including probable reserves expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures 

the production volumes prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairments will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows since the standardized measure requires the use of historical twelve month average prices  

the corporation’s impairment tests of longlived ep producing assets are based on its best estimates of future production volumes including recovery factors selling prices operating and capital costs the timing of future production and other factors which are updated each time an impairment test is performed the corporation could have impairments if the projected production volumes from oil and gas fields decrease crude oil and natural gas selling prices decline significantly for an extended period or future estimated capital and operating costs increase significantly 

the corporation’s goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable the goodwill test is conducted at a reporting unit level which is defined in accounting standards as an operating segment or one level 

  

below an operating segment the reporting unit or units to be used in an evaluation and measurement of goodwill for impairment testing are determined from a number of factors including the manner in which the business is managed the corporation has concluded that the ep segment is the reporting unit for the purposes of testing goodwill for impairment since the ep segment is managed globally by one segment manager who allocates financial and technical resources globally and reviews operating results at the segment level accordingly the corporation expects that the benefits of goodwill will be recovered through the operations of that segment 

if any of the ep segment components such as our financial reporting regions united states europe africa and asia were considered to be reporting units an analysis would be performed to determine if these components were economically similar as defined in the accounting standard for goodwill asc 3502035 if components are economically similar that guidance requires that those components be aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit 

while the corporation believes that the ep segment is the reporting unit because of the manner in which the business is managed it also evaluated the required aggregation criteria specified in the accounting standard for segment reporting asc 280105011 and determined that its components are economically similar for the following reasons 

 

      if the corporation reorganized its exploration and production business such that there was more than one reporting unit goodwill may be assigned to two or more reporting units 

the corporation’s fair value estimate of the ep segment is the sum of 1 the discounted anticipated cash flows of producing assets and known developments 2 the estimated risk adjusted present value of exploration assets and 3 an estimated market premium to reflect the market price an acquirer would pay for potential synergies including cost savings access to new business opportunities enterprise control improved processes and increased market share the corporation also considers the relative market valuation of similar ep companies 

the determination of the fair value of the ep segment depends on estimates about oil and gas reserves future prices timing of future net cash flows and market premiums significant extended declines in crude oil and natural gas prices or reduced reserve estimates could lead to a decrease in the fair value of the ep segment that could result in an impairment of goodwill 

as there are significant differences in the way longlived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing there may be impairments of individual assets that would not cause an impairment of the goodwill assigned to the ep segment 

impairment of equity investees the corporation reviews equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an other than temporary decline in value may have occurred the fair value measurement used in the impairment assessment is based on quoted market prices where available or other valuation techniques including discounted cash flows differences between the carrying value of the corporation’s equity investments and its equity in the net assets of the affiliate that result from impairment charges are amortized over the remaining useful life of the affiliate’s fixed assets 

income taxes judgments are required in the determination and recognition of income tax assets and liabilities in the financial statements these judgments include the requirement to only recognize the financial statement effect of a tax position when management believes that it is more likely than not that based on the technical merits the position will be sustained upon examination 

the corporation has net operating loss carryforwards or credit carryforwards in several jurisdictions including the united states and has recorded deferred tax assets for those losses and credits additionally the corporation has deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain 

  

assets and liabilities regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized in evaluating realizability of deferred tax assets the corporation refers to the reversal periods for available carryforward periods for net operating losses and credit carryforwards temporary differences the availability of tax planning strategies the existence of appreciated assets and estimates of future taxable income and other factors estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas reserves and selling prices that are consistent with the corporation’s internal business forecasts additionally the corporation has income taxes which have been deferred on intercompany transactions eliminated in consolidation related to transfers of property plant and equipment remaining within the consolidated group the amortization of these income taxes deferred on intercompany transactions will occur ratably with the recovery through depletion and depreciation of the carrying value of these assets the corporation does not provide for deferred us income taxes for that portion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations 

fair value measurements the corporation’s derivative instruments and supplemental pension plan investments are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings or other comprehensive income each period as appropriate the corporation uses various valuation approaches in determining fair value including the market and income approaches the corporation’s fair value measurements also include nonperformance risk and time value of money considerations counterparty credit is considered for receivable balances and the corporation’s credit is considered for accrued liabilities 

the corporation also records certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value when required by generally accepted accounting principles these fair value measurements are recorded in connection with business combinations the initial recognition of asset retirement obligations and any impairment of longlived assets equity method investments or goodwill 

the corporation determines fair value in accordance with the fasb fair value measurements accounting standard which established a hierarchy for the inputs used to measure fair value based on the source of the input which generally range from quoted prices for identical instruments in a principal trading market level 1 to estimates determined using related market data level 3 multiple inputs may be used to measure fair value however the level of fair value is based on the lowest significant input level within this fair value hierarchy 

details on the methods and assumptions used to determine the fair values are as follows 

fair value measurements based on level 1 inputs measurements that are most observable are based on quoted prices of identical instruments obtained from the principal markets in which they are traded closing prices are both readily available and representative of fair value market transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to assure liquidity the fair value of certain of the corporation’s exchange traded futures and options are considered level 1 

fair value measurements based on level 2 inputs measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered level 2 measurements based on level 2 inputs include overthecounter derivative instruments that are priced on an exchange traded curve but have contractual terms that are not identical to exchange traded contracts the corporation utilizes fair value measurements based on level 2 inputs for certain forwards swaps and options the liability related to the corporation’s crude oil hedges is classified as level 2 

fair value measurements based on level 3 inputs measurements that are least observable are estimated from related market data determined from sources with little or no market activity for comparable contracts or are positions with longer durations for example in its energy marketing business the corporation sells natural gas and electricity to customers and offsets the price exposure by purchasing forward contracts the fair value of these sales and purchases may be based on specific prices at less liquid delivered locations which are classified as level 3 fair values determined using discounted cash flows and other unobservable data are also classified as level 3 

derivatives the corporation utilizes derivative instruments for both risk management and trading activities in risk management activities the corporation uses futures forwards options and swaps individually or in combination to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in the prices of crude oil natural gas refined petroleum 

  

products and electricity as well as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates in trading activities the corporation principally through a consolidated partnership trades energyrelated commodities and derivatives including futures forwards options and swaps based on expectations of future market conditions 

all derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in the corporation’s consolidated balance sheet the corporation’s policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative the changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized currently in earnings derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions cash flow hedges or hedges of firm commitments fair value hedges the effective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income loss amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings the ineffective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recorded currently in earnings changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings the change in fair value of the related hedged commitment is recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized currently in earnings 

derivatives that are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges are tested for effectiveness prospectively before they are executed and both prospectively and retrospectively on an ongoing basis to determine whether they continue to qualify for hedge accounting the prospective and retrospective effectiveness calculations are performed using either historical simulation or other statistical models which utilize historical observable market data consisting of futures curves and spot prices 

retirement plans the corporation has funded noncontributory defined benefit pension plans and an unfunded supplemental pension plan the corporation recognizes in the consolidated balance sheet the net change in the funded status of the projected benefit obligation for these plans 

the determination of the obligations and expenses related to these plans are based on several actuarial assumptions the most significant of which relate to the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations expected longterm rates of return on plan assets and rate of future increases in compensation levels these assumptions represent estimates made by the corporation some of which can be affected by external factors for example the discount rate used to estimate the corporation’s projected benefit obligation is based on a portfolio of highquality fixed income debt instruments with maturities that approximate the expected payment of plan obligations while the expected return on plan assets is developed from the expected future returns for each asset category weighted by the target allocation of pension assets to that asset category changes in these assumptions can have a material impact on the amounts reported in the corporation’s financial statements 

asset retirement obligations the corporation has material legal obligations to remove and dismantle long lived assets and to restore land or seabed at certain exploration and production locations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles the corporation recognizes a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations in addition the fair value of any legally required conditional asset retirement obligations is recorded if the liability can be reasonably estimated the corporation capitalizes such costs as a component of the carrying amount of the underlying assets in the period in which the liability is incurred in order to measure these obligations the corporation estimates the fair value of the obligations by discounting the future payments that will be required to satisfy the obligations in determining these estimates the corporation is required to make several assumptions and judgments related to the scope of dismantlement timing of settlement interpretation of legal requirements inflationary factors and discount rate in addition there are other external factors which could significantly affect the ultimate settlement costs for these obligations including changes in environmental regulations and other statutory requirements fluctuations in industry costs and foreign currency exchange rates and advances in technology as a result the corporation’s estimates of asset retirement obligations are subject to revision due to the factors described above changes in estimates prior to settlement result in adjustments to both the liability and related asset values 

  

environment health and safety 

the corporation has a valuesbased sociallyresponsible strategy focused on improving environment health and safety performance and making a positive impact on communities where it does business the strategy is reflected in the corporation’s environment health safety and social responsibility ehs  sr policies and by environment and safety management systems that help protect the corporation’s workforce customers and local communities the corporation’s management systems are designed to uphold or exceed international standards and are intended to promote internal consistency adherence to policy objectives and continual improvement in ehs  sr performance improved performance may in the shortterm increase the corporation’s operating costs and could also require increased capital expenditures to reduce potential risks to assets reputation and license to operate in addition to enhanced ehs  sr performance improved productivity and operational efficiencies may be realized as collateral benefits from investments in ehs  sr the corporation has programs in place to evaluate regulatory compliance audit facilities train employees prevent and manage risks and emergencies and to generally meet corporate ehs  sr goals 

over the last several years many refineries have entered into consent agreements to resolve the united states environmental protection agency’s epa assertions that refining facilities were modified or expanded without complying with the new source review regulations that require permits and new emission controls in certain circumstances and other regulations that impose emissions control requirements in january 2011 hovensa signed a consent decree with the epa to resolve its claims under the terms of the consent decree hovensa agreed to pay a penalty of approximately 5 million and spend approximately 700 million over the next 10 years to install equipment and implement additional operating procedures at the hovensa refinery to reduce emissions in addition the consent decree requires hovensa to spend approximately 5 million to fund an environmental project to be determined at a later date by the virgin islands and 500000 to assist the virgin islands water and power authority with monitoring however as a result of hovensa’s decision to shut down its refinery which was announced in january 2012 hovensa believes that it will not be required to make material capital expenditures pursuant to this consent decree the corporation believes that it will also enter into a consent decree with the epa in the near future to resolve these matters as they relate to its port reading refinery facility which is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the financial condition results of operations or cash flows of the corporation 

the corporation produces and distributes fuel oils in the united states many states and localities are adopting requirements that mandate a lower sulfur content of fuel oils and restrict the types of fuel oil sold within their jurisdictions these proposals could require capital expenditures by the corporation for its port reading refining facility to meet the required sulfur content standards or other changes in the marketing of fuel oils and affect the profitability of that facility 

the corporation has undertaken a program to assess monitor and reduce the emission of greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide and methane the corporation recognizes that climate change is a global environmental concern the corporation is committed to the responsible management of greenhouse gas emissions from our existing assets and future developments and is implementing a strategy to control our carbon emissions 

the corporation will have continuing expenditures for environmental assessment and remediation sites where corrective action may be necessary include gasoline stations terminals onshore exploration and production facilities refineries including solid waste management units under permits issued pursuant to the resource conservation and recovery act and although not currently significant “superfund” sites where the corporation has been named a potentially responsible party 

the corporation accrues for environmental assessment and remediation expenses when the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable at yearend 2011 the corporation’s reserve for estimated remediation liabilities was approximately 60 million the corporation expects that existing reserves for environmental liabilities will adequately cover costs to assess and remediate known sites the corporation’s remediation spending was 19 million in 2011 13 million in 2010 and 11 million in 2009 capital expenditures for facilities primarily to comply with federal state and local environmental standards other than for the low sulfur requirements were approximately 95 million in 2011 85 million in 2010 and 50 million in 2009

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend in the normal course of its business the corporation is exposed to commodity risks related to changes in the price of crude oil natural gas refined petroleum products and electricity as well as to changes in interest rates and foreign currency values in the disclosures that follow risk management activities are referred to as energy marketing and corporate risk management activities the corporation also has trading operations principally through a 50 voting interest in a consolidated partnership that trades energyrelated commodities securities and derivatives these activities are also exposed to commodity risks primarily related to the prices of crude oil natural gas and refined petroleum products the following describes how these risks are controlled and managed 

controls the corporation maintains a control environment under the direction of its chief risk officer and through its corporate risk policy which the corporation’s senior management has approved controls include volumetric term and value at risk limits the chief risk officer must approve the use of new instruments or commodities risk limits are monitored and are reported on a daily basis to business units and to senior management the corporation’s risk management department also performs independent verifications of sources of fair values and validations of valuation models these controls apply to all of the corporation’s risk management and trading activities including the consolidated trading partnership the corporation’s treasury department is responsible for administering and monitoring foreign exchange rate and interest rate hedging programs 

the corporation uses value at risk to monitor and control commodity risk within its risk management and trading activities the value at risk model uses historical simulation and the results represent the potential loss in fair value over one day at a 95 confidence level the model captures both first and second order sensitivities for options results may vary from time to time as strategies change in trading activities or hedging levels change in risk management activities 

instruments the corporation primarily uses forward commodity contracts foreign exchange forward contracts futures swaps options and energy commodity based securities in its risk management and trading activities these contracts are generally widely traded instruments with standardized terms the following describes these instruments and how the corporation uses them 

 

  

  

   

  

  

 risk management activities 

energy marketing activities in its energy marketing activities the corporation sells refined petroleum products natural gas and electricity principally to commercial and industrial businesses at fixed and floating prices for varying periods of time commodity contracts such as futures forwards swaps and options together with physical assets such as storage are used to obtain supply and reduce margin volatility or lower costs related to sales contracts with customers 

corporate risk management corporate risk management activities include transactions designed to reduce risk in the selling prices of crude oil refined petroleum products or natural gas produced by the corporation or to reduce exposure to foreign currency or interest rate movements generally futures swaps or option strategies may be used to reduce risk in the selling price of a portion of the corporation’s crude oil or natural gas production forward contracts may also be used to purchase certain currencies in which the corporation does business with the intent of reducing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations interest rate swaps may also be used generally to convert fixedrate interest payments to floating 

the corporation has outstanding foreign exchange contracts used to reduce its exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates for various currencies including the british pound and the thai baht at december   31   2011 the corporation had a payable for foreign exchange contracts maturing in 2012 with a fair value of 14   million the change in fair value of the foreign exchange contracts from a 10 strengthening of the us dollar exchange rate is estimated to be a loss of approximately 89 million at december 31 2011 

the corporation’s outstanding longterm debt of 6040 million has a fair value of 7317 million at december 31 2011 a 15 decrease in the rate of interest would increase the fair value of debt by approximately 247 million at december 31 2011 

following is the value at risk for the corporation’s energy marketing and risk management commodity derivatives activities excluding foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives described above 

 

  

 

the increase in the value at risk for the corporation’s energy marketing and risk management commodity derivatives activities in 2011 primarily reflects additional brent crude oil cash flow hedge positions as described in note 17 risk management and trading activities in the notes to the consolidated financial statements

sales commitments 

 

in the ep segment the corporation has no contracts or agreements to sell fixed quantities of its crude oil production the corporation has contracts to supply fixed quantities of natural gas principally relating to producing fields in asia the most significant of these commitments relates to the jda where the minimum contract quantity of natural gas is estimated at 107 million mcf per year based on current entitlements under a natural gas sales contract expiring in 2027 there are additional natural gas supply commitments on producing fields in thailand and indonesia which currently total approximately 42 million mcf per year under contracts expiring in years 2021 through 2029 the corporation is also currently committed to supply 7 million mcf per year of natural gas from its 

share of production to a liquefied natural gas lng processing facility in norway under a contract expiring in 2026 the estimated total volume of natural gas subject to sales commitments under these contracts is approximately 2700 million mcf the corporation has not experienced any significant constraints in satisfying the committed quantities under these natural gas sales contracts and it anticipates being able to meet future requirements from available proved and probable reserves in the united states there are no longterm sales contracts for natural gas production from the ep segment

refining 

 

the corporation owns a 50 interest in hovensa llc hovensa a refining joint venture in the united states virgin islands with a subsidiary of petroleos de venezuela sa pdvsa in addition it owns and operates a refining facility in port reading new jersey 

 

hovensa refining operations at hovensa consist of crude units a fluid catalytic cracking unit fcc and a delayed coker unit 

 

the following table summarizes capacity and utilization rates for hovensa 

 

 

 

 

in january 2011 hovensa announced plans to shut down certain older and smaller processing units on the west side of its refinery which will reduce the refinery’s crude oil distillation capacity from 500000 to 350000 barrels per day with no impact on the capacity of its coker or fcc unit this reconfiguration which is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2011 is being undertaken to improve efficiency reliability and competitiveness in 2010 the corporation recorded an impairment charge related to its investment in hovensa for discussion of the impairment charge see note 4 refining joint venture in the notes to the financial statements on page 59 

 

the delayed coker unit permits hovensa to run lowercost heavy crude oil hovensa has longterm supply contracts with pdvsa to purchase 115000 barrels per day of venezuelan merey heavy crude oil and 155000 barrels per day of venezuelan mesa medium gravity crude oil the remaining crude oil requirements are purchased mainly under contracts of one year or less from third parties and through spot purchases on the open market after sales of refined products by hovensa to third parties the corporation purchases 50 of hovensa’s remaining production at market prices 

 

gross crude runs at hovensa averaged 390000 barrels per day in 2010 compared with 402000 barrels per day in 2009 and 441000 barrels per day in 2008 the 2010 and 2009 utilization rates for hovensa reflect weaker refining margins higher fuel costs and planned and unplanned maintenance during the first quarter of 2010 the fluid catalytic cracking unit at hovensa was shut down for a scheduled turnaround the 2008 utilization rates reflect a refinery wide shut down for hurricane omar 

 

port reading facility the corporation owns and operates a fluid catalytic cracking facility in port reading new jersey with a capacity of 70000 barrels per day this facility which processes residual fuel oil and vacuum 

gas oil operated at a rate of approximately 55000 barrels per day in 2010 compared with 63000 barrels per day in 2009 and 64000 barrels per day in 2008 substantially all of port reading’s production is gasoline and heating oil during 2010 the port reading refining facility was shutdown for 41 days for a scheduled turnaround

gulf of mexico update in april 2010 an accident occurred on the transocean deepwater horizon drilling rig at the bp plc bp operated macondo prospect in the gulf of mexico resulting in loss of life the sinking of the rig and a significant crude oil spill the corporation was not a participant in the well as a result of the accident a temporary drilling moratorium was imposed in the gulf of mexico in october 2010 the drilling moratorium was lifted by the united states department of the interior’s bureau of ocean energy management regulation and enforcement boemre provided operators complied with all rules and requirements including a series of new drilling and safety rules issued by boemre the corporation is currently evaluating the impact of these new requirements on its activities in the gulf of mexico as well as seeking approvals for plans and permits submitted in connection with planned activities however the new regulatory environment is expected to result in a longer permitting process and higher costs 

 

the moratorium impacted development drilling at the shenzi field in which the corporation has a 28 interest a production well that was being drilled was suspended and the drilling of a second production well that was planned for 2010 was postponed the corporation estimates that these delays reduced 2010 production by approximately 2000 barrels of oil equivalent per day boepd and will likely reduce 2011 production by approximately 4000 boepd in 2010 the corporation’s only operated drilling rig in the gulf of mexico the stena forth left the pony project on green canyon 469 as part of a preexisting agreement for a one well farmout of the rig to another operator 

 

in january 2011 the boemre announced that supplementary environmental reviews will not be required of 13 companies to resume work on the 16 wells that were in progress when the moratorium took effect including the aforementioned suspended shenzi and pony wells however these projects must comply with the new safety rules and regulations before work can resume as a result the corporation does not anticipate that it will be able to recommence these operations before the second half of 2011 

 

additionally the corporation has filed suspension of operations soo applications with the boemre for several exploration block licenses in the gulf of mexico that are due to expire in 2011 and may file additional applications as deemed necessary these soo applications seek approval for extension of the lease expiration terms due to circumstances outside the control of the corporation that have delayed activities required to hold the licenses 

 

remediation plans and procedures the corporation has in place a series of assetspecific emergency response and continuity plans which detail procedures for rapid and effective emergency response and environmental mitigation activities for its global offshore operations these plans are maintained reviewed and updated annually to ensure their accuracy and suitability 

 

where appropriate plans are reviewed and approved by the relevant host government authorities on a periodic basis the corporation has a current oil spill response plan for its gulf of mexico operations that has been approved by the boemre this plan sets forth expectations for response training drills and capabilities and the strategies procedures and methods that will be employed in the event of a spill covering the following topics spill response organization incident command post communications and notifications spill detection and assessment including worst case discharge scenarios identification and protection of environmental resources strategic response planning mobilization and deployment of spill response equipment and personnel oil and debris removal and disposal the use of dispersants and chemical and biological agents insitu burning of oil wildlife rehabilitation and documentation requirements 

 

responder training and drills are routinely held worldwide to assess and continually improve the effectiveness of the corporation’s plans the corporation’s contractors service providers representatives from government agencies and where applicable joint venture partners participate in the drills to ensure that emergency procedures are comprehensive and can be effectively implemented 

 

to complement internal capabilities the corporation maintains membership contracts with oil spill response organizations to provide coverage for its global drilling and production operations these organizations are clean gulf associates national response corporation nrc and oil spill response osr clean gulf associates is a regional spill response organization for the gulf of mexico nrc and osr are global response corporations and are available to assist the corporation when needed anywhere in the world in addition to owning response assets in 

their own right these organizations maintain business relationships that provide immediate access to additional critical response support services if required these owned response assets include nearly 300 recovery and storage vessels and barges more than 250 skimmers over 300000 feet of boom and significant quantities of dispersants and other ancillary equipment including aircraft if the corporation were to request these organizations to obtain additional critical response support services it would provide the funding for such services and seek reimbursement under its insurance coverages described below in certain circumstances the corporation pursues and enters into mutual aid agreements with other companies and government cooperatives to receive and provide oil spill response equipment and personnel support it also has representation on the executive committee of clean gulf associates and the board of directors of osr maintaining close associations with these organizations 

 

in light of the recent events in the gulf of mexico the corporation is participating in a number of industrywide task forces that are studying better ways to assess the risk of and prevent offshore incidents access and control blowouts in subsea environments and improve containment and recovery methods the task forces are working closely with the oil and gas industry and international government agencies to implement improvements and increase the effectiveness of oil spill prevention preparedness response and recovery processes 

 

insurance coverage and indemnification the corporation maintains insurance coverage that includes coverage for physical damage to its property third party liability workers’ compensation and employers’ liability general liability sudden and accidental pollution and other coverage this insurance coverage is subject to deductibles exclusions and limitations and there is no assurance that such coverage will adequately protect the corporation against liability from all potential consequences and damages 

 

the amount of insurance covering physical damage to the corporation’s property and liability related to negative environmental effects resulting from a sudden and accidental pollution event excluding windstorm coverage in the gulf of mexico where it is self insured varies by asset based on the asset’s estimated replacement value or the estimated maximum loss in the case of a catastrophic event first party coverage consists of two tiers of insurance the first 250 million of coverage is provided through an industry mutual insurance group above this 250 million threshold insurance is carried which ranges in value to over 19 billion in total depending on the asset coverage level as described above additionally the corporation carries insurance which provides third party coverage for general liability and sudden and accidental pollution up to 995 million 

 

other insurance policies provide coverage for among other things charterer’s legal liability in the amount of 500 million per occurrence and aircraft liability in the amount of 300 million per occurrence 

 

the corporation’s insurance policies renew at various dates each year future insurance coverage for the industry could increase in cost and may include higher deductibles or retentions or additional exclusions or limitations in addition some forms of insurance may become unavailable in the future or unavailable on terms that are deemed economically acceptable 

 

generally the corporation’s drilling contracts and most of its other offshore services contracts provide for a mutual hold harmless indemnity structure whereby each party to the contract the corporation and contractor indemnifies the other party for injuries or damages to their personnel and property regardless of fault variations include indemnity exclusions to the extent a claim is attributable to the gross negligence andor willful misconduct of a party thirdparty claims on the other hand are generally allocated on a fault basis 

 

the corporation is customarily responsible for and indemnifies the contractor against all claims including those from thirdparties to the extent attributable to pollution or contamination by substances originating from its reservoirs or other property regardless of fault including gross negligence and willful misconduct and the contractor is responsible for and indemnifies the corporation for all claims attributable to pollution emanating from the contractor’s property additionally the corporation is generally liable for all of its own losses and most thirdparty claims associated with catastrophic losses such as blowouts cratering and loss of hole regardless of cause although exceptions for losses attributable to gross negligence andor willful misconduct do exist lastly many offshore services contracts include overall limitations of the contractor’s liability equal to the value of the contract or a fixed amount whichever is greater 

 

under a standard joint operating agreement joa each party is liable for all claims arising under the joa not covered by or in excess of insurance carried by the joa to the extent of its participating interest operator or non 

operator variations include indemnity exclusions where the claim is based upon the gross negligence andor willful misconduct of a party in which case such party is solely liable 

 

environmental compliance with various existing environmental and pollution control regulations imposed by federal state local and foreign governments is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the corporation’s financial condition or results of operations the corporation spent 13 million in 2010 for environmental remediation for further discussion of environmental matters see the environment health and safety section of item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

 

number of employees the number of persons employed by the corporation at yearend was approximately 13800 in 2010 and 13300 in 2009

 item 1a   risk factors related to our business and operations tableend  

our business activities and the value of our securities are subject to significant risk factors including those described below the risk factors described below could negatively affect our operations financial condition liquidity and results of operations and as a result holders and purchasers of our securities could lose part or all of their investments it is possible additional risks relating to our securities may be described in a prospectus supplement if we issue securities in the future 

 

our business and operating results are highly dependent on the market prices of crude oil natural gas refined petroleum products and electricity which can be very volatile our estimated proved reserves revenue operating cash flows operating margins future earnings and trading operations are highly dependent on the prices of crude oil natural gas refined petroleum products and electricity which are influenced by numerous factors beyond our control historically these prices have been very volatile the major foreign oil producing countries including members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec exert considerable influence over the supply and price of crude oil and refined petroleum products their ability or inability to agree on a common policy on rates of production and other matters has a significant impact on the oil markets the commodities trading markets as well as other supply and demand factors may also influence the selling prices of crude oil natural gas refined petroleum products and electricity to the extent that we engage in hedging activities to mitigate commodity price volatility we may not realize the benefit of price increases above the hedged price changes in commodity prices can also have a material impact on collateral and margin requirements under our derivative contracts in addition we utilize significant bank credit facilities to support these collateral and margin requirements an inability to renew or replace such credit facilities as they mature would negatively impact our liquidity 

 

if we fail to successfully increase our reserves our future crude oil and natural gas production will be adversely impacted we own or have access to a finite amount of oil and gas reserves which will be depleted over time replacement of oil and gas production and reserves including proved undeveloped reserves is subject to successful exploration drilling development activities and enhanced recovery programs therefore future oil and gas production is dependent on technical success in finding and developing additional hydrocarbon reserves exploration activity involves the interpretation of seismic and other geological and geophysical data which does not always successfully predict the presence of commercial quantities of hydrocarbons drilling risks include 

unexpected adverse conditions irregularities in pressure or formations equipment failure blowouts and weather interruptions future developments may be affected by unforeseen reservoir conditions which negatively affect recovery factors or flow rates the costs of drilling and development activities have increased in recent years which could negatively affect expected economic returns reserve replacement can also be achieved through acquisition although due diligence is used in evaluating acquired oil and gas properties similar risks may be encountered in the production of oil and gas on properties acquired from others 

 

there are inherent uncertainties in estimating quantities of proved reserves and discounted future net cash flow and actual quantities may be lower than estimated numerous uncertainties exist in estimating quantities of proved reserves and future net revenues from those reserves actual future production oil and gas prices revenues taxes capital expenditures operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates and could materially affect the estimated quantities of our proved reserves and the related future net revenues in addition reserve estimates may be subject to downward or upward revisions based on production performance purchases or sales of properties results of future development prevailing oil and gas prices production sharing contracts which may decrease reserves as crude oil and natural gas prices increase and other factors 

 

we are subject to changing laws and regulations and other governmental actions that can significantly and adversely affect our business federal state local territorial and foreign laws and regulations relating to tax increases and retroactive tax claims expropriation or nationalization of property mandatory government participation cancellation or amendment of contract rights and changes in import and export regulations limitations on access to exploration and development opportunities as well as other political developments may affect our operations we also market motor fuels through lesseedealers and wholesalers in certain states where legislation prohibits producers or refiners of crude oil from directly engaging in retail marketing of motor fuels similar legislation has been periodically proposed in various other states as a result of the accident in april 2010 at the bpoperated macondo prospect in the gulf of mexico in which the corporation was not a participant and the ensuing significant oil spill a temporary drilling moratorium was imposed in the gulf of mexico while this moratorium has since been lifted significant new regulations have been imposed and further legislation and regulations may be proposed including an increase in the potential liability in the event of an oil spill uncertainty continues to exist as to the conditions under which future drilling in the gulf of mexico will occur however the new regulatory environment is expected to result in a longer permitting process and higher costs 

 

political instability in areas where we operate can adversely affect our business some of the international areas in which we operate and the partners with whom we operate are politically less stable than other areas and partners current political unrest in north africa and the middle east may affect our operations in these areas as well as oil and gas markets generally the threat of terrorism around the world also poses additional risks to the operations of the oil and gas industry 

 

our oil and gas operations are subject to environmental risks and environmental laws and regulations that can result in significant costs and liabilities our oil and gas operations like those of the industry are subject to environmental risk such as oil spills produced water spills gas leaks and ruptures and discharges of substances or gases that could expose us to substantial liability for pollution or other environmental damage for example the accident at the bpoperated macondo prospect in april 2010 resulted in a significant release of crude oil which caused extensive environmental and economic damage our operations are also subject to numerous united states federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations noncompliance with these laws and regulations may subject us to administrative civil or criminal penalties remedial cleanups and natural resource damages or other liabilities in addition increasingly stringent environmental regulations particularly relating to the production of motor and other fuels have resulted and will likely continue to result in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us and the oil and gas industry in general 

 

concerns have been raised in certain jurisdictions where we have operations concerning the safety and environmental impact of the drilling and development of unconventional oil and gas resources particularly using the process of hydraulic fracturing while we believe that these operations can be conducted safely and with minimal impact on the environment regulatory bodies are responding to these concerns and may impose temporary moratoriums and new regulations on such drilling operations that would likely have the effect of delaying and increasing the cost of such operations 

concerns about climate change may result in significant operational changes and expenditures and reduced demand for our products we recognize that climate change is a global environmental concern continuing political and social attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national regional or local legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions these agreements and measures may require significant equipment modifications operational changes taxes or purchase of emission credits to reduce emission of greenhouse gases from our operations which may result in substantial capital expenditures and compliance operating maintenance and remediation costs in addition we manufacture petroleum fuels which through normal customer use result in the emission of greenhouse gases regulatory initiatives to reduce the use of these fuels may reduce our sales of and revenues from these products finally to the extent that climate change may result in more extreme weather related events we could experience increased costs related to prevention maintenance and remediation of affected operations in addition to costs and lost revenues related to delays and shutdowns 

 

our industry is highly competitive and many of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than us the petroleum industry is highly competitive and very capital intensive we encounter competition from numerous companies in each of our activities including acquiring rights to explore for crude oil and natural gas and in purchasing and marketing of refined products natural gas and electricity many competitors including national oil companies are larger and have substantially greater resources we are also in competition with producers and marketers of other forms of energy increased competition for worldwide oil and gas assets has significantly increased the cost of acquisitions in addition competition for drilling services technical expertise and equipment has in the recent past affected the availability of technical personnel and drilling rigs resulting in increased capital and operating costs 

 

catastrophic events whether naturally occurring or manmade may materially affect our operations and financial conditions our oil and gas operations are subject to unforeseen occurrences which have affected us from time to time and which may damage or destroy assets interrupt operations and have other significant adverse effects examples of catastrophic risks include hurricanes fires explosions and blowouts such as the accident at the macondo prospect operated by bp in the gulf of mexico although we maintain a level of insurance coverage consistent with industry practices against property and casualty losses there can be no assurance that such insurance will adequately protect the corporation against liability from all potential consequences and damages moreover some forms of insurance may be unavailable in the future or be available only on terms that are deemed economically unacceptable

the corporation along with many other companies engaged in refining and marketing of gasoline has been a party to lawsuits and claims related to the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe in gasoline a series of similar lawsuits many involving water utilities or governmental entities were filed in jurisdictions across the united states against producers of mtbe and petroleum refiners who produced gasoline containing mtbe including the corporation the principal allegation in all cases is that gasoline containing mtbe is a defective product and that these parties are strictly liable in proportion to their share of the gasoline market for damage to groundwater resources and are required to take remedial action to ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of releases of mtbe in 2008 the majority of the cases against the corporation were settled in 2010 additional cases were settled and three new cases were filed the six unresolved cases consist of five cases that have been consolidated for pretrial purposes in the southern district of new york as part of a multidistrict litigation proceeding and an action brought in state court by the state of new hampshire in 2007 a pretax charge of 40 million was recorded to cover all of the known mtbe cases against the corporation 

 

over the last several years many refiners have entered into consent agreements to resolve the united states environmental protection agency’s epa assertions that refining facilities were modified or expanded without complying with new source review regulations that require permits and new emission controls in certain circumstances and other regulations that impose emissions control requirements these consent agreements which arise out of an epa enforcement initiative focusing on petroleum refiners and utilities have typically imposed substantial civil fines and penalties and required i significant capital expenditures to install emissions control equipment over a three to eight year time period and ii changes to operations which resulted in increased operating costs the capital expenditures penalties and supplemental environmental projects for individual 

refineries covered by the settlements can vary significantly depending on the size and configuration of the refinery the circumstances of the alleged modifications and whether the refinery has previously installed more advanced pollution controls in january 2011 hovensa signed a consent decree with epa to resolve its claims under the terms of the consent decree hovensa will pay a penalty of approximately 5 million and spend approximately 700 million over the next 10 years to install equipment and implement additional operating procedures at the hovensa refinery to reduce emissions in addition the consent decree requires hovensa to spend approximately 5 million to fund an environmental project to be determined at a later date by the virgin islands and 500000 to assist the virgin islands water and power authority with monitoring the consent decree has been lodged with the united states district court for the virgin islands and approval is pending in addition substantial progress has been made towards resolving this matter for the port reading refining facility which is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the corporation’s financial position or results of operations 

 

on september 13 2007 hovensa received a notice of violation nov pursuant to section 113ai of the clean air act act from the epa finding that hovensa failed to obtain proper permitting for the construction and operation of its delayed coking unit in accordance with applicable law and regulations hovensa believes it properly obtained all necessary permits for this project the nov states that the epa has authority to issue an administrative order assessing penalties for violation of the act this matter is resolved by the consent decree discussed above provided that the consent decree is entered by the court 

 

in december 2006 hovensa received a nov from the epa alleging noncompliance with emissions limits in a permit issued by the virgin islands department of planning and natural resources dpnr for the two process heaters in the delayed coking unit the nov was issued in response to a voluntary investigation and submission by hovensa regarding potential noncompliance with the permit emissions limits for two pollutants any exceedances were minor from the perspective of the amount of pollutants emitted in excess of the limits this matter is resolved by the consent decree discussed above provided that the consent decree is entered by the court 

 

on december 16 2010 the virgin islands department of planning and natural resources commenced four separate enforcement actions against hovensa by issuance of documents titled “notice of violation order for corrective action notice of assessment of civil penalty notice of opportunity for hearing” the “novs” the novs assert violations of virgin islands air pollution control laws and regulations arising out of air release incidents at the hovensa refinery in 2009 and 2010 and propose total penalties of 1355000 hovensa intends to vigorously defend this matter 

 

the corporation received a directive from the new jersey department of environmental protection njdep to remediate contamination in the sediments of the lower passaic river and njdep is also seeking natural resource damages the directive insofar as it affects the corporation relates to alleged releases from a petroleum bulk storage terminal in newark new jersey now owned by the corporation the corporation and over 70 companies entered into an administrative order on consent with the epa to study the same contamination njdep has also sued several other companies linked to a facility considered by the state to be the largest contributor to river contamination in january 2009 these companies added third party defendants including the corporation to that case in june 2007 the epa issued a draft study which evaluated six alternatives for early action with costs ranging from 900 million to 23 billion based on adverse comments from the corporation and others the epa is reevaluating its alternatives in addition the federal trustees for natural resources have begun a separate assessment of damages to natural resources in the passaic river given the ongoing studies remedial costs cannot be reliably estimated at this time based on currently known facts and circumstances the corporation does not believe that this matter will result in a material liability because its terminal could not have contributed contamination along most of the river’s length and did not store or use contaminants which are of the greatest concern in the river sediments and because there are numerous other parties who will likely share in the cost of remediation and damages 

 

in july 2004 hess oil virgin islands corp hovic a wholly owned subsidiary of the corporation and hovensa each received a letter from the commissioner of the virgin islands department of planning and natural resources and natural resources trustees advising of the trustee’s intention to bring suit against hovic and hovensa under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla the letter alleges that hovic and hovensa are potentially responsible for damages to natural resources arising 

from releases of hazardous substances from the hovensa refinery which had been operated by hovic until october 1998 an action was filed on may 5 2005 in the district court of the virgin islands against hovensa hovic and other companies that operated industrial facilities on the south shore of st croix asserting that the defendants are liable under cercla and territorial statutory and common law for damages to natural resources hovic and hovensa do not believe that this matter will result in a material liability as they believe that they have strong defenses to this complaint and they intend to vigorously defend this matter 

 

the corporation periodically receives notices from epa that it is a “potential responsible party” under the superfund legislation with respect to various waste disposal sites under this legislation all potentially responsible parties are jointly and severally liable for certain sites epa’s claims or assertions of liability against the corporation relating to these sites have not been fully developed with respect to the remaining sites epa’s claims have been settled or a proposed settlement is under consideration in all cases for amounts that are not material the ultimate impact of these proceedings and of any related proceedings by private parties on the business or accounts of the corporation cannot be predicted at this time due to the large number of other potentially responsible parties and the speculative nature of cleanup cost estimates but is not expected to be material 

 

the corporation is from time to time involved in other judicial and administrative proceedings including proceedings relating to other environmental matters the corporation cannot predict with certainty if how or when such proceedings will be resolved or what the eventual relief if any may be particularly for proceedings that are in their early stages of development or where plaintiffs seek indeterminate damages numerous issues may need to be resolved including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters before a loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated for any proceeding subject to the foregoing in management’s opinion based upon currently known facts and circumstances the outcome of such proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the corporation although the outcome of such proceedings could be material to the corporation’s results of operations and cash flows for a particular period depending on among other things the level of the corporation’s net income for such period

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend  

overview 

 

the corporation is a global integrated energy company that operates in two segments exploration and production ep and marketing and refining mr the ep segment explores for develops produces purchases transports and sells crude oil and natural gas the mr segment manufactures refined petroleum products and purchases markets and trades refined petroleum products natural gas and electricity 

 

net income in 2010 was 2125 million compared with 740 million in 2009 and 2360 million in 2008 diluted earnings per share were 647 in 2010 compared with 227 in 2009 and 724 in 2008 a table of items affecting comparability between periods is shown on page 25 

 

exploration and production 

 

the corporation’s strategy for the ep segment is to profitably grow reserves and production in a sustainable and financially disciplined manner the corporation’s total proved reserves were 1537 million barrels of oil equivalent boe at december 31 2010 compared with 1437 million boe at december 31 2009 and 1432 million boe at december 31 2008 

 

ep earnings were 2736 million in 2010 1042 million in 2009 and 2423 million in 2008 average realized crude oil selling prices were 6620 per barrel in 2010 5162 in 2009 and 8204 in 2008 including the impact of hedging production averaged 418000 barrels of oil equivalent per day boepd in 2010 an increase of 10000 boepd or 25 from 2009 production averaged 408000 boepd in 2009 an increase of 27000 boepd or 7 from 381000 boepd in 2008 the corporation estimates that total worldwide production will average between 415000 and 425000 boepd in 2011 

 

the following is an update of significant ep activities during 2010 

 

 22 

  

  

gulf of mexico update in april 2010 an accident occurred on the transocean deepwater horizon drilling rig at the bp plc bp operated macondo prospect in the gulf of mexico resulting in loss of life the sinking of the rig and a significant crude oil spill the corporation was not a participant in the well as a result of the accident a temporary drilling moratorium was imposed in the gulf of mexico in october 2010 the drilling moratorium was lifted by the united states department of the interior’s bureau of ocean energy management regulation and enforcement boemre provided operators complied with all rules and requirements including a series of new drilling and safety rules issued by boemre the corporation is currently evaluating the impact of these new requirements on its activities in the gulf of mexico as well as seeking approvals for plans and permits submitted in connection with planned activities however the new regulatory environment is expected to result in a longer permitting process and higher costs 

 

the moratorium impacted development drilling at the shenzi field in which the corporation has a 28 interest a production well that was being drilled was suspended and the drilling of a second production well that was planned for 2010 was postponed the corporation estimates that these delays reduced 2010 production by approximately 2000 boepd and will likely reduce 2011 production by approximately 4000 boepd in 2010 the corporation’s only operated drilling rig in the gulf of mexico the stena forth left the pony project on green canyon 469 as part of a preexisting agreement for a one well farmout of the rig to another operator 

 

in january 2011 the boemre announced that supplementary environmental reviews will not be required of 13 companies to resume work on the 16 wells that were in progress when the moratorium took effect including the aforementioned suspended shenzi and pony wells however these projects must comply with the new safety rules and regulations before work can resume as a result the corporation does not anticipate that it will be able to recommence these operations before the second half of 2011 

 

additionally the corporation has filed suspension of operations soo applications with the boemre for several exploration block licenses in the gulf of mexico that are due to expire in 2011 and may file additional applications as deemed necessary these soo applications seek approval for extension of the lease expiration terms due to circumstances outside the control of the corporation that have delayed activities required to hold the licenses 

marketing and refining 

 

the corporation’s strategy for the mr segment is to deliver consistent operating performance and generate free cash flow mr earnings losses were 231 million in 2010 127 million in 2009 and 277 million in 2008 refining operations generated losses of 445 million in 2010 and 87 million in 2009 and income of 73 million in 2008 refining results for 2010 include an aftertax impairment charge of 289 million 300 million pretax to reduce the carrying value of the corporation’s investment in hovensa llc to the estimated fair value the refining results in 2010 and 2009 also reflect weak refining margins and lower volumes marketing earnings were 215 million in 2010 168 million in 2009 and 240 million in 2008 

 

liquidity and capital and exploratory expenditures 

 

net cash provided by operating activities was 4530 million in 2010 3046 million in 2009 and 4688 million in 2008 principally reflecting fluctuations in earnings at december 31 2010 cash and cash equivalents totaled 1608 million compared with 1362 million at december 31 2009 total debt was 5583 million at december 31 2010 compared with 4467 million at december 31 2009 in august 2010 the corporation issued 1250 million of 30 year fixedrate notes with a coupon of 56 that are scheduled to mature in 2041 the proceeds were used for the acquisition of additional acreage in the bakken and additional interests in the valhall and hod fields in january 2010 the corporation completed the repurchase of the remaining 116 million of notes that were scheduled to mature in 2011 the corporation’s debt to capitalization ratio at december 31 2010 was 249 compared with 248 at the end of 2009 

 

capital and exploratory expenditures were as follows for the years ended december 31 

 

 

 

 

the corporation anticipates investing 56 billion in capital and exploratory expenditures in 2011 substantially all of which relates to ep operations 

 

consolidated results of operations 

 

the aftertax results by major operating activity are summarized below 

 

 

 

the following table summarizes on an aftertax basis items of income expense that are included in net income and affect comparability between periods the items in the table below are explained on pages 28 through 31 

 

 

 

 

in the discussion that follows the financial effects of certain transactions are disclosed on an aftertax basis management reviews segment earnings on an aftertax basis and uses aftertax amounts in its review of variances in segment earnings management believes that aftertax amounts are a preferable method of explaining variances in earnings since they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only the pretax amount aftertax amounts are determined by applying the income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pretax amounts 

 

comparison of results 

 

exploration and production 

 

following is a summarized income statement of the corporation’s ep operations 

 

 

 

 

  

after considering the ep items in the table on page 28 the remaining changes in ep earnings are primarily attributable to changes in selling prices production and sales volumes operating costs exploration expenses foreign exchange and income taxes as discussed below 

 

selling prices higher average selling prices increased ep revenues by approximately 1775 million in 2010 compared with 2009 lower average selling prices reduced ep revenues by approximately 4000 million in 2009 compared with 2008 

the corporation’s average selling prices were as follows 

 

 

 

 

in october 2008 the corporation closed its brent crude oil hedges covering 24000 barrels per day from 2009 though 2012 by entering into offsetting contracts with the same counterparty the deferred aftertax loss as of the date the hedge positions were closed will be recorded in earnings as the contracts mature the estimated annual aftertax loss from the closed positions will be approximately 330 million in 2011 and 2012 crude oil hedges reduced ep earnings by 338 million 533 million before income taxes in 2010 and 337 million 533 million before income taxes in 2009 crude oil and natural gas hedges reduced ep earnings by 423 million 685 million before income taxes in 2008 

 

production and sales volumes the corporation’s crude oil and natural gas production was 418000 boepd in 2010 compared with 408000 boepd in 2009 and 381000 boepd in 2008 approximately 73 in 2010 72 in 2009 and 70 in 2008 of the corporation’s production was from crude oil and natural gas liquids the corporation currently estimates that its 2011 production will average between 415000 and 425000 boepd after a reduction of approximately 4000 boepd due to drilling delays at the shenzi field in the gulf of mexico as well as the effect of the sale in february 2011 of natural gas producing assets in the united kingdom north sea 

the corporation’s net daily worldwide production was as follows 

 

 

 

 

  

united states crude oil and natural gas production in the united states was higher in 2010 compared with 2009 primarily due to production from the shenzi llano conger and bakken fields crude oil and natural gas production was higher in 2009 compared with 2008 primarily due to new production from the shenzi field and production resuming after the 2008 hurricanes hurricane impacts reduced full year 2008 production by an estimated 7000 boepd 

 

europe crude oil production was higher in 2010 compared with 2009 due to higher production in russia and an increase in norway following the acquisition of additional interests in the valhall and hod fields partially offset by lower production in the united kingdom north sea following the exchange of clair for additional norway interests crude oil production was comparable in 2009 and 2008 as higher production in russia offset lower production in the united kingdom north sea natural gas production was lower in 2010 compared with 2009 primarily due to downtime at certain united kingdom gas fields natural gas production was lower in 2009 compared with 2008 primarily due to decline and subsequent cessation of production at the atlantic and cromarty fields 

 

africa crude oil production decreased in 2010 compared with 2009 following the exchange of gabon for additional interests in the valhall and hod fields in norway in the third quarter and lower entitlement to algerian production crude oil production decreased in 2009 compared with 2008 primarily due to lower production from the ceiba field 

 

asia and other natural gas production in 2010 was lower than in 2009 primarily due to downtime at the pangkah field and a temporary shutin at the bumi field in the joint development area of malaysiathailand jda natural gas production in 2009 was higher than in 2008 primarily due to a full year of phase 2 sales from jda the decrease in crude oil production in 2010 from 2009 principally reflects changes to the corporation’s entitlement to production in azerbaijan 

sales volumes higher sales volumes and other operating revenues increased revenue by approximately 135 million in 2010 compared with 2009 and 1030 million in 2009 compared with 2008 

 

operating costs and depreciation depletion and amortization cash operating costs consisting of production expenses and general and administrative expenses increased by 145 million in 2010 compared with 2009 and decreased by 114 million in 2009 compared with 2008 the increase in 2010 compared with 2009 was primarily due to higher production taxes as a result of higher selling prices the decrease in 2009 compared with 2008 was primarily due to lower production taxes due to lower realized selling prices the cessation of production at several united kingdom north sea fields the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and cost savings initiatives partially offset by the impact of higher production volumes 

 

depreciation depletion and amortization charges increased by 109 million in 2010 and 191 million in 2009 compared with the corresponding amounts in prior years the increases in both 2010 and 2009 were primarily due to higher production volumes and per barrel costs reflecting higher finding and development costs 

 

excluding items affecting comparability between periods cash operating costs per barrel of oil equivalent were 1445 in 2010 1370 in 2009 and 1549 in 2008 cash operating costs in 2011 are estimated to be in the range of 1500 to 1600 per barrel of oil equivalent depreciation depletion and amortization costs per barrel of oil equivalent were 1456 in 2010 1419 in 2009 and 1379 in 2008 depreciation depletion and amortization costs for 2011 are estimated to be in the range of 1450 to 1550 per barrel of oil equivalent 

 

effective december 31 2009 the securities and exchange commission sec issued updated standards for oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure the new rules allow among other changes the use of permitted technology in determining oil and gas reserve estimates since it was not practical to calculate reserve estimates under both the old and the new reserve estimation standards it was not possible to precisely measure the effect of adopting the new sec requirements on total proved reserves at december 31 2009 however the corporation estimates that applying the new rules increased income during 2010 by approximately 80 million after income taxes due to lower depreciation depletion and amortization expense 

 

exploration expenses exploration expenses increased in 2010 from 2009 primarily due to higher lease amortization exploration expenses increased in 2009 compared to 2008 mainly due to higher dry hole costs and lease amortization 

 

income taxes excluding the impact of items affecting comparability the effective income tax rates for ep operations were 44 in 2010 48 in 2009 and 49 in 2008 the effective income tax rate for ep operations in 2011 is estimated to be in the range of 45 to 49 

 

foreign exchange the aftertax foreign currency losses were 9 million in 2010 10 million in 2009 and 80 million in 2008 the foreign currency loss in 2008 reflects the net effect of significant exchange rate movements in the fourth quarter of 2008 on the remeasurement of assets liabilities and foreign currency forward contracts by certain foreign businesses 

 

reported ep earnings include the following items affecting comparability of income expense before and after income taxes 

 

 

 

2010   the corporation completed the exchange of its interests in gabon and the clair field in the united kingdom for additional interests of 28 and 25 respectively in the valhall and hod fields in norway this nonmonetary transaction which was recorded at fair value resulted in a pretax gain of 1150 million 1072 million after income taxes the corporation also completed the sale of its interest in the jambi merang natural gas development project in indonesia for a gain of 58 million 

 

the corporation recorded a charge of 532 million 334 million after income taxes to fully impair the carrying value of its 55 interest in the west med block located offshore egypt this interest was acquired in 2006 and included four natural gas discoveries and additional exploration prospects the corporation and its partners subsequently explored and further evaluated the area made a fifth discovery conducted development planning and held negotiations with the egyptian authorities to amend the existing gas sales agreement in september 2010 the corporation and its partners notified the egyptian authorities of their decision to cease exploration activities and to relinquish a significant portion of the block as a result the corporation fully impaired the carrying value of its interests in the west med block 

 

the corporation recorded 101 million 64 million after income taxes of dry hole expenses related to previously suspended well costs on the west med block offshore egypt and block bms22 offshore brazil both of which were drilled prior to 2010 

 

2009 the us supreme court decided it would not review the decision of the 5th circuit court of appeals against the us minerals management service predecessor to the bureau of ocean energy management regulation and enforcement relating to royalty relief under the deep water royalty relief act of 1995 as a result the corporation recognized aftertax income of 89 million to reverse all previously recorded royalties covering the periods from 2003 to 2009 the pretax amount of 143 million was reported in other net in the statement of consolidated income 

 

the corporation recorded total asset impairment charges of 54 million 26 million after income taxes to reduce the carrying value of twoshort lived fields in the united kingdom north sea 

 

pretax charges of approximately 25 million 18 million after income taxes were recorded to impair the carrying values of production equipment and to write down materials inventories in equatorial guinea and the united states the pretax amount of most of the inventory write downs was reported in production expenses in the statement of consolidated income 

 

2008 pretax charges of 30 million 17 million after income taxes were recorded to impair the carrying values of mature fields in the united states and the united kingdom north sea 

 

pretax charges of 15 million 9 million after income taxes were recorded to expense costs associated with hurricanes gustav and ike in the gulf of mexico the pretax amount of the charges totaling 15 million were reported in production expenses in the statement of consolidated income 

 

the corporation’s future ep earnings may be impacted by external factors such as volatility in the selling prices of crude oil and natural gas reserve and production changes exploration expenses industry cost inflation changes in foreign exchange rates and income tax rates the effects of weather political risk environmental risk and catastrophic risk in addition as a result of the oil spill in 2010 at the bp operated macondo prospect in the gulf of mexico there have been and there may be further changes in laws and regulations that could impact the corporation’s future drilling operations and increase its potential liability in the event of an oil spill for a more comprehensive description of the risks that may affect the corporation’s ep business see item 1a risk factors related to our business and operations 

 

marketing and refining 

 

earnings losses from mr activities amounted to 231 million in 2010 127 million in 2009 and 277 million in 2008 excluding the items affecting comparability reflected in the table on page 25 and discussed below the earnings were 58 million 115 million and 277 million respectively

contractual obligations and contingencies 

 

following is a table showing aggregated information about certain contractual obligations at december 31 2010 

 

 

 

 

  

in the preceding table the corporation’s supply commitments include its estimated purchases of 50 of hovensa’s production of refined products after anticipated sales by hovensa to unaffiliated parties the value of future supply commitments will fluctuate based on prevailing market prices actual refinery output and the amount of product sold by hovensa to unaffiliated third parties under the product sales agreement between the corporation and hovensa hovensa is entitled to reserve refined products for sale to unaffiliated third parties each month up to a maximum amount set by the executive committee of hovensa annually the corporation is obligated to purchase 50 of the remaining refined products produced by hovensa including amounts reserved for third party sales by hovensa that remain unsold the prices at which the corporation purchases refined products are determined by reference to published market prices prevailing at the time of purchase the amount of the purchase commitment from hovensa is based on the forecasted refinery output that is expected to be sold to the corporation calculated using yearend prices 

 

also included above are term purchase agreements at market prices for additional gasoline necessary to supply the corporation’s retail marketing system and feedstocks for the port reading refining facility in addition the corporation has commitments to purchase refined products natural gas and electricity to supply contracted customers in its energy marketing business these commitments were computed based predominately on yearend market prices 

 

the table also reflects future capital expenditures including the portion of the corporation’s planned 56 billion capital investment program for 2011 that is contractually committed at december 31 2010 obligations for operating expenses include commitments for transportation seismic purchases oil and gas production expenses and other normal business expenses other longterm liabilities reflect contractually committed obligations on the balance sheet at december 31 2010 including asset retirement obligations pension plan liabilities and anticipated obligations for uncertain income tax positions

accounting policies 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

accounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of assets and liabilities on the corporation’s balance sheet and revenues and expenses on the income statement the accounting methods used can affect net income equity and various financial statement ratios however the corporation’s accounting policies generally do not change cash flows or liquidity 

 

accounting for exploration and development costs exploration and production activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage including lease bonuses brokers’ fees and other related costs are capitalized annual lease rentals exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred costs of drilling and equipping productive wells including development dry holes and related production facilities are capitalized in production operations costs of injected co 2 for tertiary recovery are expensed as incurred 

 

the costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if 1 the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and 2 sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operational viability of the project if either of those criteria is not met or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project the capitalized well costs are charged to expense indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves and the economic and operating viability of a project include commitment of project personnel active negotiations for sales contracts with customers negotiations with governments operators and contractors and firm plans for additional drilling and other factors 

crude oil and natural gas reserves the sec revised its oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure requirements effective for yearend 2009 reporting in addition the financial accounting standards board fasb revised its accounting standard on oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosures the determination of estimated proved reserves is a significant element in arriving at the results of operations of exploration and production activities the estimates of proved reserves affect well capitalizations the unit of production depreciation rates of proved properties and wells and equipment as well as impairment testing of oil and gas assets and goodwill 

 

for reserves to be booked as proved they must be determined with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations in addition government and project operator approvals must be obtained and depending on the amount of the project cost senior management or the board of directors must commit to fund the project the corporation maintains its own internal reserve estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work directly with the oil and gas properties the corporation’s technical staff updates reserve estimates throughout the year based on evaluations of new wells performance reviews new technical data and other studies to provide consistency throughout the corporation standard reserve estimation guidelines definitions reporting reviews and approval practices are used the internal reserve estimates are subject to internal technical audits and senior management review the corporation also engages an independent third party consulting firm to audit approximately 80 of the corporation’s total proved reserves 

 

impairment of longlived assets and goodwill as explained below there are significant differences in the way longlived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing the corporation reviews longlived assets including oil and gas fields for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered longlived assets are tested based on identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities if the carrying amounts of the longlived assets are not expected to be recovered by undiscounted future net cash flow estimates the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded the amount of impairment is based on the estimated fair value of the assets generally determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows 

 

in the case of oil and gas fields the present value of future net cash flows is based on management’s best estimate of future prices which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices applied to projected production volumes and discounted at a riskadjusted rate the projected production volumes represent reserves including probable reserves expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures 

 

the production volumes prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairments will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows since the standardized measure requires the use of historical twelve month average prices 

 

the corporation’s impairment tests of longlived ep producing assets are based on its best estimates of future production volumes including recovery factors selling prices operating and capital costs the timing of future production and other factors which are updated each time an impairment test is performed the corporation could have impairments if the projected production volumes from oil and gas fields decrease crude oil and natural gas selling prices decline significantly for an extended period or future estimated capital and operating costs increase significantly 

 

the corporation’s goodwill is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level which is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment the impairment test is conducted annually in the fourth quarter or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable the reporting unit or units used to evaluate and measure goodwill for impairment are determined primarily from the manner in which the business is managed the corporation’s goodwill is assigned to the ep operating segment and it expects that the benefits of goodwill will be recovered through the operation of that segment 

 

the corporation’s fair value estimate of the ep segment is the sum of 1 the discounted anticipated cash flows of producing assets and known developments 2 the estimated risk adjusted present value of exploration assets and 3 an estimated market premium to reflect the market price an acquirer would pay for potential 

synergies including cost savings access to new business opportunities enterprise control improved processes and increased market share the corporation also considers the relative market valuation of similar exploration and production companies 

 

the determination of the fair value of the ep segment depends on estimates about oil and gas reserves future prices timing of future net cash flows and market premiums significant extended declines in crude oil and natural gas prices or reduced reserve estimates could lead to a decrease in the fair value of the ep segment that could result in an impairment of goodwill 

 

as there are significant differences in the way longlived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing there may be impairments of individual assets that would not cause an impairment of the goodwill assigned to the ep segment 

 

impairment of equity investees the corporation reviews equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an other than temporary decline in value may have occurred the fair value measurement used in the impairment assessment is based on quoted market prices where available or other valuation techniques including discounted cash flows differences between the carrying value of the corporation’s equity investments and its equity in the net assets of the affiliate that result from impairment charges are amortized over the remaining useful life of the affiliate’s fixed assets 

 

income taxes judgments are required in the determination and recognition of income tax assets and liabilities in the financial statements these judgments include the requirement to only recognize the financial statement effect of a tax position when management believes that it is more likely than not that based on the technical merits the position will be sustained upon examination 

 

the corporation has net operating loss carryforwards or credit carryforwards in several jurisdictions including the united states and has recorded deferred tax assets for those losses and credits additionally the corporation has deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized in evaluating realizability of deferred tax assets the corporation refers to the reversal periods for available carryforward periods for net operating losses and credit carryforwards temporary differences the availability of tax planning strategies the existence of appreciated assets and estimates of future taxable income and other factors estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas reserves and selling prices that are consistent with the corporation’s internal business forecasts additionally the corporation has income taxes which have been deferred on intercompany transactions eliminated in consolidation related to transfers of property plant and equipment remaining within the consolidated group the amortization of these income taxes deferred on intercompany transactions will occur ratably with the recovery through depletion and depreciation of the carrying value of these assets the corporation does not provide for deferred us income taxes for that portion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations 

 

fair value measurements the corporation’s derivative instruments and supplemental pension plan investments are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings or other comprehensive income each period as appropriate the corporation uses various valuation approaches in determining fair value including the market and income approaches the corporation’s fair value measurements also include nonperformance risk and time value of money considerations counterparty credit is considered for receivable balances and the corporation’s credit is considered for accrued liabilities 

 

the corporation also records certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value when required by generally accepted accounting principles these fair value measurements are recorded in connection with business combinations the initial recognition of asset retirement obligations and any impairment of longlived assets equity method investments or goodwill 

 

the corporation determines fair value in accordance with the fasb fair value measurements accounting standard which established a hierarchy for the inputs used to measure the fair value of financial asset and liabilities based on the source of the input which generally range from quoted prices for identical instruments in a principal 

trading market level 1 to estimates determined using related market data level 3 multiple inputs may be used to measure fair value however the level of fair value is based on the lowest significant input level within this fair value hierarchy 

 

details on the methods and assumptions used to determine the fair values are as follows  

 

fair value measurements based on level 1 inputs measurements that are most observable are based on quoted prices of identical instruments obtained from the principal markets in which they are traded closing prices are both readily available and representative of fair value market transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to assure liquidity the fair value of certain of the corporation’s exchange traded futures and options are considered level 1 

 

fair value measurements based on level 2 inputs measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered level 2 measurements based on level 2 inputs include overthecounter derivative instruments that are priced on an exchange traded curve but have contractual terms that are not identical to exchange traded contracts the corporation utilizes fair value measurements based on level 2 inputs for certain forwards swaps and options the liability related to the corporation’s crude oil hedges is classified as level 2 

 

fair value measurements based on level 3 inputs measurements that are least observable are estimated from related market data determined from sources with little or no market activity for comparable contracts or are positions with longer durations for example in its energy marketing business the corporation sells natural gas and electricity to customers and offsets the price exposure by purchasing forward contracts the fair value of these sales and purchases may be based on specific prices at less liquid delivered locations which are classified as level 3 fair values determined using discounted cash flows and other unobservable data are also classified as level 3 

 

derivatives the corporation utilizes derivative instruments for both risk management and trading activities in risk management activities the corporation uses futures forwards options and swaps individually or in combination to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in the prices of crude oil natural gas refined products and electricity as well as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates in trading activities the corporation principally through a consolidated partnership trades energy commodities and derivatives including futures forwards options and swaps based on expectations of future market conditions 

 

all derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in the corporation’s balance sheet the corporation’s policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative the changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized currently in earnings derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions cash flow hedges or hedges of firm commitments fair value hedges the effective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income loss amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings the ineffective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recorded currently in earnings changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings the change in fair value of the related hedged commitment is recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized currently in earnings 

 

derivatives that are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges are tested for effectiveness prospectively before they are executed and both prospectively and retrospectively on an ongoing basis to determine whether they continue to qualify for hedge accounting the prospective and retrospective effectiveness calculations are performed using either historical simulation or other statistical models which utilize historical observable market data consisting of futures curves and spot prices 

 

retirement plans the corporation has funded noncontributory defined benefit pension plans and an unfunded supplemental pension plan the corporation recognizes on the balance sheet the net change in the funded status of the projected benefit obligation for these plans 

the determination of the obligations and expenses related to these plans are based on several actuarial assumptions the most significant of which relate to the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations expected longterm rates of return on plan assets and rate of future increases in compensation levels these assumptions represent estimates made by the corporation some of which can be affected by external factors for example the discount rate used to estimate the corporation’s projected benefit obligation is based on a portfolio of highquality fixed income debt instruments with maturities that approximate the expected payment of plan obligations while the expected return on plan assets is developed from the expected future returns for each asset category weighted by the target allocation of pension assets to that asset category changes in these assumptions can have a material impact on the amounts reported in the corporation’s financial statements 

 

asset retirement obligations the corporation has material legal obligations to remove and dismantle long lived assets and to restore land or seabed at certain exploration and production locations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles the corporation recognizes a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations in addition the fair value of any legally required conditional asset retirement obligations is recorded if the liability can be reasonably estimated the corporation capitalizes such costs as a component of the carrying amount of the underlying assets in the period in which the liability is incurred in order to measure these obligations the corporation estimates the fair value of the obligations by discounting the future payments that will be required to satisfy the obligations in determining these estimates the corporation is required to make several assumptions and judgments related to the scope of dismantlement timing of settlement interpretation of legal requirements inflationary factors and discount rate in addition there are other external factors which could significantly affect the ultimate settlement costs for these obligations including changes in environmental regulations and other statutory requirements fluctuations in industry costs and foreign currency exchange rates and advances in technology as a result the corporation’s estimates of asset retirement obligations are subject to revision due to the factors described above changes in estimates prior to settlement result in adjustments to both the liability and related asset values 

 

changes in accounting policies 

 

effective january 1 2010 the corporation adopted the amended accounting standards that eliminated the consolidation exception for a qualifying specialpurpose entity and changed the analysis necessary to determine whether consolidation of a variable interest entity is required the adoption of these standards resulted in an increase of approximately 10 million to property plant and equipment and a corresponding increase to longterm debt the debt was subsequently repaid during the first quarter of 2010 

 

effective december 31 2009 the fasb adopted accounting standards update asu extractive activities — oil and gas asc 932 oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosures which amended the requirements for oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosures the main provisions of the asu which align accounting standards with the previously issued securities and exchange commission sec requirements expand the definition of oil and gas producing activities to include the extraction of resources which are saleable as synthetic oil or gas to change the price assumption used for reserve estimation and future cash flows to a twelve month average from the yearend price and to amend the geographic disclosure requirements for reporting reserves and other supplementary oil and gas data see the supplementary oil and gas data for these disclosures 

 

environment health and safety 

 

the corporation has a valuesbased sociallyresponsible strategy focused on improving environment health and safety performance and making a positive impact on communities where it does business the strategy is reflected in the corporation’s environment health safety and social responsibility ehs  sr policies and by environment and safety management systems that help protect the corporation’s workforce customers and local communities the corporation’s management systems are designed to uphold or exceed international standards and are intended to promote internal consistency adherence to policy objectives and continual improvement in ehs  sr performance improved performance may in the shortterm increase the corporation’s operating costs and could also require increased capital expenditures to reduce potential risks to assets reputation and license to operate in addition to enhanced ehs  sr performance improved productivity and operational efficiencies may be realized as collateral benefits from investments in ehs  sr the corporation has programs in place to evaluate 

regulatory compliance audit facilities train employees prevent and manage risks and emergencies and to generally meet corporate ehs  sr goals 

 

the corporation and hovensa produce and the corporation distributes fuel oils in the united states many states and localities are adopting requirements that mandate a lower sulfur content of fuel oils and restrict the types of fuel oil sold within their jurisdictions these proposals could require capital expenditures by the corporation and hovensa to meet the required sulfur content standards or other changes in the marketing of fuel oils 

 

over the last several years many refiners have entered into consent agreements to resolve the united states environmental protection agency’s epa assertions that refining facilities were modified or expanded without complying with new source review regulations that require permits and new emission controls in certain circumstances and other regulations that impose emissions control requirements these consent agreements which arise out of an epa enforcement initiative focusing on petroleum refiners and utilities have typically imposed substantial civil fines and penalties and required i significant capital expenditures to install emissions control equipment over a three to eight year time period and ii changes to operations which resulted in increased operating costs the capital expenditures penalties and supplemental environmental projects for individual refineries covered by the settlements can vary significantly depending on the size and configuration of the refinery the circumstances of the alleged modifications and whether the refinery has previously installed more advanced pollution controls in january 2011 hovensa signed a consent decree with epa to resolve its claims under the terms of the consent decree hovensa will pay a penalty of approximately 5 million and spend approximately 700 million over the next 10 years to install equipment and implement additional operating procedures at the hovensa refinery to reduce emissions in addition the consent decree requires hovensa to spend approximately 5 million to fund an environmental project to be determined at a later date by the virgin islands and 500000 to assist the virgin islands water and power authority with monitoring the consent decree has been lodged with the united states district court for the virgin islands and approval is pending in addition substantial progress has been made towards resolving this matter for the port reading refining facility which is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the corporation’s financial position or results of operations 

 

the corporation has undertaken a program to assess monitor and reduce the emission of greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide and methane the corporation recognizes that climate change is a global environmental concern the corporation is committed to the responsible management of greenhouse gas emissions from our existing assets and future developments and is implementing a strategy to control our carbon emissions 

 

the corporation will have continuing expenditures for environmental assessment and remediation sites where corrective action may be necessary include gasoline stations terminals onshore exploration and production facilities refineries including solid waste management units under permits issued pursuant to the resource conservation and recovery act and although not currently significant “superfund” sites where the corporation has been named a potentially responsible party 

 

the corporation accrues for environmental assessment and remediation expenses when the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable at yearend 2010 the corporation’s reserve for estimated remediation liabilities was approximately 55 million the corporation expects that existing reserves for environmental liabilities will adequately cover costs to assess and remediate known sites the corporation’s remediation spending was 13 million in 2010 and 11 million in both 2009 and 2008 capital expenditures for facilities primarily to comply with federal state and local environmental standards other than for the low sulfur requirements were approximately 85 million in 2010 50 million in 2009 and 15 million in 2008

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

in the normal course of its business the corporation is exposed to commodity risks related to changes in the price of crude oil natural gas refined products and electricity as well as to changes in interest rates and foreign currency values in the disclosures that follow these risk management activities are referred to as energy marketing and corporate risk management the corporation also has trading operations principally through a 50 voting interest in a consolidated partnership that trades energy commodities and energy derivatives these activities are also exposed to commodity risks primarily related to the prices of crude oil natural gas and refined products the following describes how these risks are controlled and managed 

 

controls the corporation maintains a control environment under the direction of its chief risk officer and through its corporate risk policy which the corporation’s senior management has approved controls include volumetric term and value at risk limits the chief risk officer must approve the use of new instruments or commodities risk limits are monitored and reported on daily to business units and to senior management the corporation’s risk management department also performs independent verifications of sources of fair values and validations of valuation models these controls apply to all of the corporation’s risk management and trading activities including the consolidated trading partnership the corporation’s treasury department is responsible for administering foreign exchange rate and interest rate hedging programs 

 

the corporation uses value at risk to monitor and control commodity risk within its trading and risk management activities the value at risk model uses historical simulation and the results represent the potential loss in fair value over one day at a 95 confidence level the model captures both first and second order sensitivities for options results may vary from time to time as strategies change in trading activities or hedging levels change in risk management activities 

 

instruments the corporation primarily uses forward commodity contracts foreign exchange forward contracts futures swaps options and energy commodity based securities in its risk management and trading activities these contracts are generally widely traded instruments with standardized terms the following describes these instruments and how the corporation uses them

risk management activities 

 

energy marketing activities in its energy marketing activities the corporation sells refined petroleum products natural gas and electricity principally to commercial and industrial businesses at fixed and floating prices for varying periods of time commodity contracts such as futures forwards swaps and options together with physical assets such as storage are used to obtain supply and reduce margin volatility or lower costs related to sales contracts with customers 

 

corporate risk management corporate risk management activities include transactions designed to reduce risk in the selling prices of crude oil refined products or natural gas produced by the corporation or to reduce exposure to foreign currency or interest rate movements generally futures swaps or option strategies may be used to reduce risk in the selling price of a portion of the corporation’s crude oil or natural gas production forward contracts may also be used to purchase certain currencies in which the corporation does business with the intent of reducing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations interest rate swaps may also be used generally to convert fixedrate interest payments to floating 

 

the corporation uses foreign exchange contracts to reduce its exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates by entering into formal contracts for various currencies including the british pound and the thai baht at december 31 2010 the corporation had a payable for foreign exchange contracts maturing in 2011 with a fair value of 7 million the change in fair value of the foreign exchange contracts from a 10 strengthening of the us dollar exchange rate is estimated to be an approximately 88 million loss at december 31 2010 

 

the corporation’s fixedrate debt of 5569 million has a fair value of 6353 million at december 31 2010 a 15 decrease in the rate of interest would increase the fair value of debt by approximately 147 million at december 31 2010

 item 1a   risk factors related to our business and operations tableend  

our business activities and the value of our securities are subject to significant risk factors including those described below the risk factors described below could negatively affect our operations financial condition liquidity and results of operations and as a result holders and purchasers of our securities could lose part or all of their investments it is possible additional risks relating to our securities may be described in a prospectus supplement if we issue securities in the future 

 

commodity price risk our estimated proved reserves revenue operating cash flows operating margins future earnings and trading operations are highly dependent on the prices of crude oil natural gas and refined petroleum products which are influenced by numerous factors beyond our control historically these prices have been very volatile and most recently have been affected by changes in demand associated with the global economic downturn the major foreign oil producing countries including members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec exert considerable influence over the supply and price of crude oil and refined petroleum products their ability or inability to agree on a common policy on rates of production and other matters has a significant impact on the oil markets the commodities trading markets may also influence the selling prices of crude oil natural gas and refined petroleum products to the extent that we engage in hedging activities to mitigate commodity price volatility we may not realize the benefit of price increases above the hedged price changes in commodity prices can also have a material impact on collateral and margin requirements under our derivative contracts in addition we utilize significant bank credit facilities to support these collateral and margin requirements an inability to renew or replace such credit facilities as they mature would negatively impact our liquidity 

 

technical risk we own or have access to a finite amount of oil and gas reserves which will be depleted over time replacement of oil and gas reserves is subject to successful exploration drilling development activities and enhanced recovery programs therefore future oil and gas production is dependent on technical success in finding and developing additional hydrocarbon reserves exploration activity involves the interpretation of seismic and other geological and geophysical data which does not always successfully predict the presence of commercial quantities of hydrocarbons drilling risks include unexpected adverse conditions irregularities in pressure or formations equipment failure blowouts and weather interruptions future developments may be affected by unforeseen reservoir conditions which negatively affect recovery factors or flow rates the costs of drilling and development activities have increased in recent years which could negatively affect expected economic returns reserve replacement can also be achieved through acquisition although due diligence is used in evaluating acquired oil and gas properties similar risks may be encountered in the production of oil and gas on properties acquired from others 

oil and gas reserves and discounted future net cash flow risks numerous uncertainties exist in estimating quantities of proved reserves and future net revenues from those reserves actual future production oil and gas prices revenues taxes capital expenditures operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates and could materially affect the estimated quantities and future net revenues of our proved reserves in addition reserve estimates may be subject to downward or upward revisions based on production performance purchases or sales of properties results of future development prevailing oil and gas prices production sharing contracts which may decrease reserves as crude oil and natural gas prices increase and other factors 

 

political risk federal state local territorial and foreign laws and regulations relating to tax increases and retroactive tax claims expropriation or nationalization of property mandatory government participation cancellation or amendment of contract rights and changes in import regulations limitations on access to exploration and development opportunities as well as other political developments may affect our operations some of the international areas in which we operate and the partners with whom we operate are politically less stable than other areas and partners the threat of terrorism around the world also poses additional risks to the operations of the oil and gas industry we market motor fuels through lesseedealers and wholesalers in certain states where legislation prohibits producers or refiners of crude oil from directly engaging in retail marketing of motor fuels similar legislation has been periodically proposed in various other states 

 

environmental risk our oil and gas operations like those of the industry are subject to environmental risk such as oil spills produced water spills gas leaks and ruptures and discharges of substances or gases that could expose us to substantial liability for pollution or other environmental damage our operations are also subject to numerous united states federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations noncompliance with these laws and regulations may subject us to administrative civil or criminal penalties remedial cleanups and natural resource damages or other liabilities in addition increasingly stringent environmental regulations particularly relating to the production of motor and other fuels have resulted and will likely continue to result in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us and the oil and gas industry in general 

 

climate change risk we recognize that climate change is a global environmental concern continuing political and social attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national regional or local legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions these agreements and measures may require significant equipment modifications operational changes taxes or purchase of emission credits to reduce emission of greenhouse gases from our operations as a result of which we may incur substantial capital expenditures and compliance operating maintenance and remediation costs in addition we manufacture petroleum fuels which through normal customer use result in the emission of greenhouse gases regulatory initiatives to reduce the use of these fuels may reduce our sales of and revenues from these products finally to the extent that climate change may result in more extreme weather related events we could experience increased costs related to prevention maintenance and remediation of affected operations in addition to costs and lost revenues related to delays and shutdowns 

 

competitive risk the petroleum industry is highly competitive and very capital intensive we encounter competition from numerous companies in each of our activities including acquiring rights to explore for crude oil and natural gas and in purchasing and marketing of refined products natural gas and electricity many competitors including national oil companies are larger and have substantially greater resources we are also in competition with producers and marketers of other forms of energy increased competition for worldwide oil and gas assets has significantly increased the cost of acquisitions in addition competition for drilling services technical expertise and equipment has in the recent past affected the availability of technical personnel and drilling rigs and has therefore increased capital and operating costs 

 

catastrophic risk although we maintain a level of insurance coverage consistent with industry practices against property and casualty losses our oil and gas operations are subject to unforeseen occurrences which may damage or destroy assets or interrupt operations examples of catastrophic risks include hurricanes fires explosions and blowouts these occurrences have affected us from time to time

 item 3   legal proceedings tableend  

the corporation along with many other companies engaged in refining and marketing of gasoline has been a party to lawsuits and claims related to the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe in gasoline a series of similar lawsuits many involving water utilities or governmental entities were filed in jurisdictions across the united states against producers of mtbe and petroleum refiners who produced gasoline containing mtbe including the corporation the principal allegation in all cases is that gasoline containing mtbe is a defective product and that these parties are strictly liable in proportion to their share of the gasoline market for damage to groundwater resources and are required to take remedial action to ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of releases of mtbe in 2008 the majority of the cases against the corporation were settled in february 2010 the corporation reached an agreement in principle to settle all but three of the remaining cases the three unresolved cases consist of two cases that have been consolidated for pretrial purposes in the southern district of new york as part of a multidistrict litigation proceeding and an action brought in state court by the state of new hampshire in 2007 a pretax charge of 40 million was recorded to cover all of the known mtbe cases against the corporation 

 

over the last several years many refiners have entered into consent agreements to resolve the united states environmental protection agency’s epa assertions that refining facilities were modified or expanded without complying with new source review regulations that require permits and new emission controls in certain circumstances and other regulations that impose emissions control requirements these consent agreements which arise out of an epa enforcement initiative focusing on petroleum refiners and utilities have typically imposed substantial civil fines and penalties and required i significant capital expenditures to install emissions control equipment over a three to eight year time period and ii changes to operations which resulted in increased operating costs the capital expenditures penalties and supplemental environmental projects for individual refineries covered by the settlements can vary significantly depending on the size and configuration of the refinery the circumstances of the alleged modifications and whether the refinery has previously installed more advanced pollution controls the epa initially contacted the corporation and hovensa regarding the petroleum refinery initiative in august 2003 negotiations with the epa and the relevant states and the virgin islands are continuing and substantial progress has been made toward resolving this matter for both the corporation and hovensa while the effect on the corporation of the petroleum refining initiative cannot be estimated until a final settlement is reached and entered by a court additional significant future capital expenditures and operating expenses will likely be incurred by hovensa over a number of years the amount of penalties if any is not expected to be material 

 

on september 13 2007 hovensa received a notice of violation nov pursuant to section 113ai of the clean air act act from the epa finding that hovensa failed to obtain proper permitting for the construction and operation of its delayed coking unit in accordance with applicable law and regulations hovensa believes it properly obtained all necessary permits for this project the nov states that the epa has authority to issue an administrative order assessing penalties for violation of the act hovensa has entered into discussions with the epa to reach resolution of this matter the corporation does not believe that this matter will result in material liability to hovensa or the corporation 

 

in december 2006 hovensa received a nov from the epa alleging noncompliance with emissions limits in a permit issued by the virgin islands department of planning and natural resources dpnr for the two process heaters in the delayed coking unit the nov was issued in response to a voluntary investigation and submission by hovensa regarding potential noncompliance with the permit emissions limits for two pollutants any exceedances were minor from the perspective of the amount of pollutants emitted in excess of the limits hovensa has entered into discussions with the appropriate governmental agencies to reach resolution of this matter and does not believe that it will result in material liability to hovensa or the corporation 

 

the corporation received a directive from the new jersey department of environmental protection njdep to remediate contamination in the sediments of the lower passaic river and njdep is also seeking natural resource damages the directive insofar as it affects the corporation relates to alleged releases from a petroleum bulk storage terminal in newark new jersey now owned by the corporation the corporation and over 70 companies entered into an administrative order on consent with the epa to study the same contamination njdep has also sued several other companies linked to a facility considered by the state to be the largest contributor to river 

contamination in january 2009 these companies added third party defendants including the corporation to that case in june 2007 the epa issued a draft study which evaluated six alternatives for early action with costs ranging from 900 million to 23 billion based on adverse comments from the corporation and others the epa is reevaluating its alternatives in addition the federal trustees for natural resources have begun a separate assessment of damages to natural resources in the passaic river given the ongoing studies remedial costs cannot be reliably estimated at this time based on currently known facts and circumstances the corporation does not believe that this matter will result in material liability because its terminal could not have contributed contamination along most of the river’s length and did not store or use contaminants which are of the greatest concern in the river sediments and because there are numerous other parties who will likely share in the cost of remediation and damages 

 

in july 2004 hess oil virgin islands corp hovic a wholly owned subsidiary of the corporation and hovensa each received a letter from the commissioner of the virgin islands department of planning and natural resources and natural resources trustees advising of the trustee’s intention to bring suit against hovic and hovensa under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla the letter alleges that hovic and hovensa are potentially responsible for damages to natural resources arising from releases of hazardous substances from the “hovensa oil refinery” hovensa currently owns and operates a petroleum refinery on the south shore of st croix united states virgin islands which had been operated by hovic until october 1998 an action was filed on may 5 2005 in the district court of the virgin islands against hovensa hovic and other companies that operated industrial facilities on the south shore of st croix asserting that the defendants are liable under cercla and territorial statutory and common law for damages to natural resources hovic and hovensa do not believe that this matter will result in a material liability as they believe that they have strong defenses to this complaint and they intend to vigorously defend this matter

the corporation periodically receives notices from epa that it is a “potential responsible party” under the superfund legislation with respect to various waste disposal sites under this legislation all potentially responsible parties are jointly and severally liable for certain sites epa’s claims or assertions of liability against the corporation relating to these sites have not been fully developed with respect to the remaining sites epa’s claims have been settled or a proposed settlement is under consideration in all cases for amounts that are not material the ultimate impact of these proceedings and of any related proceedings by private parties on the business or accounts of the corporation cannot be predicted at this time due to the large number of other potentially responsible parties and the speculative nature of cleanup cost estimates but is not expected to be material 

 

the corporation is from time to time involved in other judicial and administrative proceedings including proceedings relating to other environmental matters although the ultimate outcome of these proceedings cannot be ascertained at this time and some of them may be resolved adversely to the corporation no such proceeding is required to be disclosed under applicable rules of the sec in management’s opinion based upon currently known facts and circumstances such proceedings in the aggregate will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the corporation

the following table summarizes on an aftertax basis items of income expense that are included in net income and affect comparability between periods the items in the table below are explained on pages 23 through 25 

 

 

 

 

in the discussion that follows the financial effects of certain transactions are disclosed on an aftertax basis management reviews segment earnings on an aftertax basis and uses aftertax amounts in its review of variances in segment earnings management believes that aftertax amounts are a preferable method of explaining variances in earnings since they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only the pretax amount aftertax amounts are determined by applying the income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pretax amounts 

 

comparison of results 

 

exploration and production 

 

following is a summarized income statement of the corporation’s ep operations 

 

 

 

 

 20 

 

after considering the ep items in the table on page 23 the remaining changes in ep earnings are primarily attributable to changes in selling prices production volumes operating costs exploration expenses foreign exchange and income taxes as discussed below 

 

selling prices lower average selling prices reduced ep revenues by approximately 4000 million in 2009 compared with 2008 higher average selling prices increased ep revenues by approximately 2100 million in 2008 compared with 2007 

 

the corporation’s average selling prices were as follows

the corporation’s net daily worldwide production was as follows in thousands 

 

 

 

 

  

united states crude oil and natural gas production in the united states was higher in 2009 compared with 2008 primarily due to new production from the shenzi field and production resuming after the 2008 hurricanes crude oil production was slightly higher in 2008 compared with 2007 principally due to production from new wells in north dakota and the deepwater gulf of mexico largely offset by the impact of hurricanes in the gulf of mexico natural gas production was lower in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily reflecting hurricane downtime and natural decline hurricane impacts reduced full year 2008 production by an estimated 7000 boepd 

 

europe crude oil production was comparable in 2009 and 2008 as higher production in russia offset lower production in the united kingdom north sea crude oil production in 2008 was lower than in 2007 due to temporary shutins at three north sea fields the cessation of production at the fife fergus flora and angus fields and natural decline these decreases were partially offset by increased production in russia natural gas production was lower in 2009 compared with 2008 primarily due to decline at the atlantic and cromarty fields 

 

africa crude oil production decreased in 2009 compared with 2008 primarily due to lower production from the ceiba field crude oil production increased in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to higher production at the okume complex partially offset by a lower entitlement to algerian production 

 

asia and other natural gas production in 2009 was higher than in 2008 primarily due to a full year of phase 2 gas sales from the joint development area of malaysiathailand jda natural gas production increased in 2008 compared with 2007 due to increased production from block a18 in the jda and a full year of production from the ujung pangkah field in indonesia the decrease in crude oil production in 2008 from 2007 principally reflects changes to the corporation’s entitlement to production in azerbaijan 

 

sales volumes higher sales volumes and other operating revenues increased revenue by approximately 1030 million in 2009 compared with 2008 and 200 million in 2008 compared with 2007

production taxes due to lower realized selling prices the cessation of production at several north sea fields the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and cost savings initiatives partially offset by the impact of higher production volumes the increase in costs in 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily due to increased production taxes due to higher realized selling prices increased cost of services and materials and higher employee costs 

 

excluding the impact of items affecting comparability depreciation depletion and amortization charges increased by 192 million in 2009 and 531 million in 2008 compared with the corresponding amounts in the prior years the increases in 2009 and 2008 were primarily due to higher production volumes and per barrel costs reflecting higher finding and development costs 

 

excluding items affecting comparability between periods unit costs were as follows cash operating costs per barrel of oil equivalent were 1370 in 2009 1549 in 2008 and 1336 in 2007 cash operating costs in 2010 are estimated to be in the range of 15 to 16 per barrel of oil equivalent depreciation depletion and amortization costs per barrel of oil equivalent were 1419 in 2009 1379 in 2008 and 1011 in 2007 depreciation depletion and amortization costs for 2010 are estimated to be in the range of 1450 to 1550 per barrel of oil equivalent

2008 the charge for asset impairments relates to mature fields in the united states and the united kingdom north sea the hurricane costs relate to expenses associated with hurricanes gustav and ike in the gulf of mexico and are recorded in production expenses 

 

2007 the gain from asset sales relates to the sale of the corporation’s interests in the scott and telford fields in the united kingdom north sea the charge for asset impairments relates to two mature fields also in the united kingdom north sea the estimated production imbalance settlements represent a charge for adjustments to prior meter readings at two offshore fields which are recorded as a reduction of sales and other operating revenues

in the preceding table the corporation’s supply commitments include its estimated purchases of 50 of hovensa’s production of refined products after anticipated sales by hovensa to unaffiliated parties the value of future supply commitments will fluctuate based on prevailing market prices at the time of purchase the actual output from hovensa and the level of sales to unaffiliated parties also included are term purchase agreements at market prices for additional gasoline necessary to supply the corporation’s retail marketing system and feedstocks for the port reading refining facility in addition the corporation has commitments to purchase refined products natural gas and electricity to supply contracted customers in its energy marketing business these commitments were computed based predominately on yearend market prices 

 

the table also reflects future capital expenditures including the portion of the corporation’s planned 41 billion capital investment program for 2010 that is contractually committed at december 31 2009 obligations for operating expenses include commitments for transportation seismic purchases oil and gas production expenses and other normal business expenses other longterm liabilities reflect contractually committed obligations on the balance sheet at december 31 2009 including asset retirement obligations pension plan liabilities and anticipated obligations for uncertain income tax positions 

 

the corporation and certain of its subsidiaries lease gasoline stations drilling rigs tankers office space and other assets for varying periods under leases accounted for as operating leases the corporation entered into a lease agreement for a new drillship and related support services for use in its global deepwater exploration and development activities the total payments under this five year contract are expected to be approximately 950 million the corporation took delivery of the drillship in the fourth quarter of 2009 

 

the corporation has a contingent purchase obligation expiring in april 2012 to acquire the remaining interest in wilcohess a retail gasoline station joint venture for approximately 184 million as of december 31 2009 

 

the corporation guarantees the payment of up to 50 of hovensa’s crude oil purchases from certain suppliers other than pdvsa the amount of the corporation’s guarantee fluctuates based on the volume of crude oil purchased and related prices and at december 31 2009 it amounted to 121 million in addition the corporation has agreed to provide funding up to a maximum of 15 million to the extent hovensa does not have funds to meet its senior debt obligations 

the corporation is contingently liable under letters of credit and under guarantees of the debt of other entities directly related to its business at december 31 2009 as shown below 

 

 

 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

the corporation has leveraged leases not included in its balance sheet primarily related to retail gasoline stations that the corporation operates the net present value of these leases is 412 million at december 31 2009 compared with 491 million at december 31 2008 the corporation’s december 31 2009 debt to capitalization ratio would increase from 248 to 265 if these leases were included as debt

accounting policies 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

accounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of assets and liabilities on the corporation’s balance sheet and revenues and expenses on the income statement the accounting methods used can affect net income equity and various financial statement ratios however the corporation’s accounting policies generally do not change cash flows or liquidity 

 

accounting for exploration and development costs exploration and production activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage including lease bonuses brokers’ fees and other related costs are capitalized annual lease rentals exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred costs of drilling and equipping productive wells including development dry holes and related production facilities are capitalized 

 

the costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if 1 the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and 2 sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project if either of those criteria is not met or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project the capitalized well costs are charged to expense indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves and the economic and operating viability of a project include commitment of project personnel active negotiations for sales contracts with customers negotiations with governments operators and contractors and firm plans for additional drilling and other factors 

 

crude oil and natural gas reserves the sec revised its oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure requirements effective for yearend 2009 reporting in addition the financial accounting standards board fasb revised its accounting standard on oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosures the determination of estimated 

proved reserves is a significant element in arriving at the results of operations of exploration and production activities the estimates of proved reserves affect well capitalizations the unit of production depreciation rates of proved properties and wells and equipment as well as impairment testing of oil and gas assets and goodwill 

 

for reserves to be booked as proved they must be determined with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations in addition government and project operator approvals must be obtained and depending on the amount of the project cost senior management or the board of directors must commit to fund the project the corporation maintains its own internal reserve estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work directly with the oil and gas properties the corporation’s technical staff updates reserve estimates throughout the year based on evaluations of new wells performance reviews new technical data and other studies to provide consistency throughout the corporation standard reserve estimation guidelines definitions reporting reviews and approval practices are used the internal reserve estimates are subject to internal technical audits and senior management review the corporation also engaged an independent third party consulting firm to audit approximately 80 of the corporation’s total proved reserves 

 

impairment of longlived assets and goodwill as explained below there are significant differences in the way longlived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing the corporation reviews longlived assets including oil and gas fields for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered longlived assets are tested based on identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities if the carrying amounts of the longlived assets are not expected to be recovered by undiscounted future net cash flow estimates the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded the amount of impairment is based on the estimated fair value of the assets generally determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows 

 

in the case of oil and gas fields the present value of future net cash flows is based on management’s best estimate of future prices which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices applied to projected production volumes and discounted at a riskadjusted rate the projected production volumes represent reserves including probable reserves expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures the production volumes prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairments will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows since the standardized measure requires the use of historical twelve month average prices 

 

the corporation’s impairment tests of longlived ep producing assets are based on its best estimates of future production volumes including recovery factors selling prices operating and capital costs the timing of future production and other factors which are updated each time an impairment test is performed the corporation could have impairments if the projected production volumes from oil and gas fields decrease crude oil and natural gas selling prices decline significantly for an extended period or future estimated capital and operating costs increase significantly 

 

the corporation’s goodwill is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level which is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment the impairment test is conducted annually in the fourth quarter or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable the reporting unit or units used to evaluate and measure goodwill for impairment are determined primarily from the manner in which the business is managed the corporation’s goodwill is assigned to the ep operating segment and it expects that the benefits of goodwill will be recovered through the operation of that segment 

 

the corporation’s fair value estimate of the ep segment is the sum of 1 the discounted anticipated cash flows of producing assets and known developments 2 the estimated risk adjusted present value of exploration assets and 3 an estimated market premium to reflect the market price an acquirer would pay for potential synergies including cost savings access to new business opportunities enterprise control improved processes and increased market share the corporation also considers the relative market valuation of similar exploration and production companies 

the determination of the fair value of the ep segment depends on estimates about oil and gas reserves future prices timing of future net cash flows and market premiums significant extended declines in crude oil and natural gas prices or reduced reserve estimates could lead to a decrease in the fair value of the ep segment that could result in an impairment of goodwill 

 

as there are significant differences in the way longlived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing there may be impairments of individual assets that would not cause an impairment of the goodwill assigned to the ep segment 

 

income taxes judgments are required in the determination and recognition of income tax assets and liabilities in the financial statements these judgments include the requirement to only recognize the financial statement effect of a tax position when management believes that it is more likely than not that based on the technical merits the position will be sustained upon examination 

 

the corporation has net operating loss carryforwards or credit carryforwards in several jurisdictions including the united states and has recorded deferred tax assets for those losses and credits additionally the corporation has deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized in evaluating realizability of deferred tax assets the corporation refers to the reversal periods for temporary differences available carryforward periods for net operating losses and credit carryforwards estimates of future taxable income the availability of tax planning strategies the existence of appreciated assets and other factors estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas reserves and selling prices that are consistent with the corporation’s internal business forecasts additionally the corporation has income taxes which have been deferred on intercompany transactions eliminated in consolidation related to transfers of property plant and equipment remaining within the consolidated group the amortization of these income taxes deferred on intercompany transactions will occur ratably with the recovery through depletion and depreciation of the carrying value of these assets the corporation does not provide for deferred us income taxes for that portion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations 

 

fair value measurements the corporation’s derivative instruments and supplemental pension plan investments are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings or other comprehensive income each period the corporation uses various valuation approaches in determining fair value including the market and income approaches the corporation’s fair value measurements also include nonperformance risk and time value of money considerations counterparty credit is considered for receivable balances and the corporation’s credit is considered for accrued liabilities 

 

the corporation determines fair value in accordance with the fasb fair value measurements accounting standard which established a hierarchy that categorizes the sources of inputs which generally range from quoted prices for identical instruments in a principal trading market level 1 to estimates determined using related market data level 3 multiple inputs may be used to measure fair value however the level of fair value is based on the lowest significant input level within this fair value hierarchy inputs include discounted cash flow calculations and other unobservable data 

 

the corporation also records certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value these fair value measurements include assets and liabilities recorded in connection with business combinations the initial recognition of asset retirement obligations and longlived assets and goodwill measured at fair value in an impairment assessment 

 

details on the methods and assumptions used to determine the fair values are as follows  

 

fair value measurements based on level 1 inputs measurements that are most observable are based on quoted prices of identical instruments obtained from the principal markets in which they are traded closing prices are both readily available and representative of fair value market transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to assure liquidity the fair value of certain of the corporation’s exchange traded futures and options are considered level 1 

fair value measurements based on level 2 inputs measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered level 2 measurements based on level 2 inputs include overthecounter derivative instruments that are priced on an exchange traded curve but have contractual terms that are not identical to exchange traded contracts the corporation utilizes fair value measurements based on level 2 inputs for certain forwards swaps and options the liability related to the corporation’s crude oil hedges is classified as level 2 

 

fair value measurements based on level 3 inputs measurements that are least observable are estimated from related market data determined from sources with little or no market activity for comparable contracts or are positions with longer durations for example in its energy marketing business the corporation sells natural gas and electricity to customers and offsets the price exposure by purchasing forward contracts the fair value of these sales and purchases may be based on specific prices at less liquid delivered locations which are classified as level 3 fair values determined using discounted cash flows are also classified as level 3 

 

derivatives the corporation utilizes derivative instruments for both risk management and trading activities in risk management activities the corporation uses futures forwards options and swaps individually or in combination to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in the prices of crude oil natural gas refined products and electricity as well as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates in trading activities the corporation principally through a consolidated partnership trades energy commodities and derivatives including futures forwards options and swaps based on expectations of future market conditions 

 

all derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in the corporation’s balance sheet the corporation’s policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative the changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized currently in earnings derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions cash flow hedges or hedges of firm commitments fair value hedges the effective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income loss amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings the ineffective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recorded currently in earnings changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings the change in fair value of the related hedged commitment is recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized currently in earnings 

 

derivatives that are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges are tested for effectiveness prospectively before they are executed and both prospectively and retrospectively on an ongoing basis to determine whether they continue to qualify for hedge accounting the prospective and retrospective effectiveness calculations are performed using either historical simulation or other statistical models which utilize historical observable market data consisting of futures curves and spot prices 

 

retirement plans the corporation has funded noncontributory defined benefit pension plans and an unfunded supplemental pension plan the corporation recognizes on the balance sheet the net change in the funded status of the projected benefit obligation for these plans 

 

the determination of the obligations and expenses related to these plans are based on several actuarial assumptions the most significant of which relate to the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations expected longterm rates of return on plan assets and rate of future increases in compensation levels these assumptions represent estimates made by the corporation some of which can be affected by external factors for example the discount rate used to estimate the corporation’s projected benefit obligation is based on a portfolio of highquality fixedincome debt instruments with maturities that approximate the expected payment of plan obligations while the expected return on plan assets is developed from the expected future returns for each asset category weighted by the target allocation of pension assets to that asset category changes in these assumptions can have a material impact on the amounts reported in the corporation’s financial statements 

 

asset retirement obligations the corporation has material legal obligations to remove and dismantle long lived assets and to restore land or seabed at certain exploration and production locations in accordance with 

generally accepted accounting principles the corporation recognizes a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations in addition the fair value of any legally required conditional asset retirement obligations is recorded if the liability can be reasonably estimated the corporation capitalizes such costs as a component of the carrying amount of the underlying assets in the period in which the liability is incurred in order to measure these obligations the corporation estimates the fair value of the obligations by discounting the future payments that will be required to satisfy the obligations in determining these estimates the corporation is required to make several assumptions and judgments related to the scope of dismantlement timing of settlement interpretation of legal requirements inflationary factors and discount rate in addition there are other external factors which could significantly affect the ultimate settlement costs for these obligations including changes in environmental regulations and other statutory requirements fluctuations in industry costs and foreign currency exchange rates and advances in technology as a result the corporation’s estimates of asset retirement obligations are subject to revision due to the factors described above changes in estimates prior to settlement result in adjustments to both the liability and related asset values 

 

changes in accounting policies 

 

the fasb accounting standards codification asc became effective on july 1 2009 the asc combined multiple sources of authoritative accounting literature into a single source of authoritative gaap organized by accounting topic since the asc was not intended to change existing gaap the only impact on the corporation’s financial statements was that specific references to accounting principles have been changed to refer to the asc 

 

effective january 1 2009 the corporation adopted the fasb accounting standard for the accounting for and reporting of noncontrolling interests in a consolidated subsidiary asc 810 — consolidation originally issued as fas 160 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 51  as required the corporation retrospectively applied the presentation and disclosure requirements of this standard at december 31 2009 and december 31 2008 noncontrolling interests of 144 million and 84 million respectively have been classified as a component of equity prior to adoption noncontrolling interests were classified in other liabilities net income loss attributable to the noncontrolling interests must also be separately reported in the statement of consolidated income certain other amounts in the consolidated financial statements and footnotes have been reclassified to conform with the presentation requirements of this standard 

 

effective january 1 2009 the corporation adopted the fasb accounting standard that expanded the qualitative quantitative and credit risk disclosure requirements related to an entity’s use of derivative instruments asc 815 — derivatives and hedging originally issued as fas 161 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities  see note 14 risk management and trading activities for these disclosures 

 

effective january 1 2009 the corporation also adopted the fasb staff position that requires the application of the fair value measurement and disclosure provisions to nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis asc 820 — fair value measurements and disclosures originally issued as fasb staff position no 1572 effective date of fasb statement no 157  such fair value measurements are determined based on the same fair value hierarchy of inputs required to measure the fair value of financial assets and liabilities the impact of this accounting standard was not material to the corporation’s consolidated financial statements 

 

effective june 30 2009 the corporation adopted the fasb accounting standard which provides guidance on the accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued asc 855 — subsequent events originally issued as fas 165 subsequent events  the adoption of this standard did not impact the corporation’s existing practice of evaluating subsequent events through the date the financial statements are issued 

 

in january 2010 the fasb adopted an accounting standards update asu extractive activities — oil and gas asc 932 — oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosures which is effective for financial statements for the year ended december 31 2009 and amends the requirements for oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosures the objective of the asu was to align accounting standards with the previously issued sec requirements on oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure the main provisions of the asu are to expand the definition of oil and gas producing activities to include the extraction of resources which are saleable as synthetic oil or gas to change the price assumption used for reserve estimation and future cash flows to a twelve month average from the yearend 

price and to amend the geographic disclosure requirements for reporting reserves and other supplementary oil and gas data see the supplementary oil and gas data for these disclosures 

 

recently issued accounting standards 

 

in june 2009 the fasb amended existing accounting standards to eliminate the concept of a qualifying specialpurpose entity asc 860 — transfers and servicing originally issued as fas 166 accounting for transfers of financial assets — an amendment of fasb statement no 140  which did not require consolidation under existing gaap the fasb also amended existing accounting standards to limit the circumstances in which transferred financial assets should be derecognized asc 810 — consolidation originally issued as fas 167 amendments to fasb interpretation no fin 46r  the amended standards require additional analysis of variable interest entities to determine if consolidation is necessary the adoption of these standards will not have a material impact on the corporation’s financial statements as required the corporation will adopt the provisions of these standards effective january 1 2010 

 

environment health and safety 

 

the corporation has a valuesbased sociallyresponsible strategy focused on improving environment health and safety performance and making a positive impact on communities where it does business the strategy is reflected in the corporation’s environment health safety and social responsibility ehs  sr policies and by environment and safety management systems that help protect the corporation’s workforce customers and local communities the corporation’s management systems are designed to uphold or exceed international standards and are intended to promote internal consistency adherence to policy objectives and continual improvement in ehs  sr performance improved performance may in the shortterm increase the corporation’s operating costs and could also require increased capital expenditures to reduce potential risks to assets reputation and license to operate in addition to enhanced ehs  sr performance improved productivity and operational efficiencies may be realized as collateral benefits from investments in ehs  sr the corporation has programs in place to evaluate regulatory compliance audit facilities train employees prevent and manage risks and emergencies and to generally meet corporate ehs  sr goals 

 

the corporation and hovensa produce and the corporation distributes fuel oils in the united states proposals by state regulatory agencies and legislatures have been made that would require a lower sulfur content of fuel oils if adopted these proposals could require capital expenditures by the corporation and hovensa to meet the required sulfur content standards 

 

as described in item 3 legal proceedings in 2003 the corporation and hovensa began discussions with the us epa regarding the epa’s petroleum refining initiative pri the pri is an ongoing program that is designed to reduce certain air emissions at all us refineries since 2000 the epa has entered into settlements addressing these emissions with petroleum refining companies that control over 90 of the domestic refining capacity negotiations with the epa are continuing and substantial progress has been made toward resolving this matter for both the corporation and hovensa while the effect on the corporation of the petroleum refining initiative cannot be estimated until a final settlement is reached and entered by a court additional significant future capital expenditures and operating expenses will likely be incurred by hovensa over a number of years the amount of penalties if any is not expected to be material 

 

the corporation has undertaken a program to assess monitor and reduce the emission of greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide and methane the corporation recognizes that climate change is a global environmental concern the corporation is committed to the responsible management of greenhouse gas emissions from our existing assets and future developments and is implementing a strategy to control our carbon emissions 

 

the corporation will have continuing expenditures for environmental assessment and remediation sites where corrective action may be necessary include gasoline stations terminals onshore exploration and production facilities refineries including solid waste management units under permits issued pursuant to the resource conservation and recovery act and although not currently significant “superfund” sites where the corporation has been named a potentially responsible party 

the corporation accrues for environmental assessment and remediation expenditures for known sites when the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable at yearend 2009 the corporation’s reserve for estimated environmental liabilities was approximately 55 million the corporation’s environmental assessment and remediation expenditures were approximately 11 million in each of the years 2009 2008 and 2007 the corporation expects that existing reserves for environmental liabilities are sufficient for costs to assess and remediate known sites the corporation anticipates capital expenditures for facilities primarily to comply with federal state and local environmental standards of approximately 50 million in 2010

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

in the normal course of its business the corporation is exposed to commodity risks related to changes in the price of crude oil natural gas refined products and electricity as well as to changes in interest rates and foreign currency values the corporation also has trading operations principally through a 50 voting interest in a consolidated partnership that trades energy commodities and energy derivatives these activities are also exposed to commodity risks primarily related to the prices of crude oil natural gas and refined products the following describes how these risks are controlled and managed 

 

controls the corporation maintains a control environment under the direction of its chief risk officer and through its corporate risk policy which the corporation’s senior management has approved controls include volumetric term and valueatrisk limits the chief risk officer must approve the use of new instruments or commodities risk limits are monitored and reported on daily to business units and to senior management the corporation’s risk management department also performs independent verifications of sources of fair values and validations of valuation models these controls apply to all of the corporation’s risk management and trading activities including the consolidated trading partnership the corporation’s treasury department is responsible for administering foreign exchange rate and interest rate hedging programs 

 

the corporation uses valueatrisk to monitor and control commodity risk within its trading and risk management activities the valueatrisk model uses historical simulation and the results represent the potential loss in fair value over one day at a 95 confidence level the model captures both first and second order sensitivities for options results may vary from time to time as strategies change in trading activities or hedging levels change in risk management activities 

 

instruments the corporation primarily uses forward commodity contracts foreign exchange forward contracts futures swaps options and energy commodity based securities in its risk management and trading activities these contracts are generally widely traded instruments with standardized terms the following describes these instruments and how the corporation uses them

risk management activities 

 

energy marketing activities in its energy marketing activities the corporation sells refined petroleum products natural gas and electricity principally to commercial and industrial businesses at fixed and floating prices for varying periods of time commodity contracts such as futures forwards swaps and options together with physical assets such as storage are used to obtain supply and reduce margin volatility or lower costs related to sales contracts with customers 

 

corporate risk management corporate risk management activities include transactions designed to reduce risk in the selling prices of crude oil or natural gas produced by the corporation or to reduce exposure to foreign currency or interest rate movements generally futures swaps or option strategies may be used to reduce risk in the selling price of a portion of the corporation’s crude oil or natural gas production forward contracts may also be used to purchase certain currencies in which the corporation does business with the intent of reducing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations interest rate swaps may also be used generally to convert fixed rate interest payments to floating 

 

the corporation uses foreign exchange contracts to reduce its exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates by entering into formal contracts for various currencies including the british pound the euro and the thai baht at december 31 2009 the corporation had a payable of 16 million related to foreign exchange contracts maturing in 2010 the fair value of the foreign exchange contracts was also a payable of 16 million at december 31 2009 the change in fair value of the foreign exchange contracts from a 20 strengthening of the us dollar exchange rate is estimated to be approximately 172 million at december 31 2009 

 

the corporation’s debt of 4467 million has a fair value of 5073 million at december 31 2009 a 15 decrease in the rate of interest would increase the fair value of debt by approximately 120 million at december 31 2009

 item 1a   risk factors related to our business and operations tableend  

our business activities and the value of our securities are subject to significant risk factors including those described below the risk factors described below could negatively affect our operations financial condition liquidity and results of operations and as a result holders and purchasers of our securities could lose part or all of their investments it is possible additional risks relating to our securities may be described in a prospectus supplement if we issue securities in the future 

 

commodity price risk our estimated proved reserves revenue operating cash flows operating margins future earnings and trading operations are highly dependent on the prices of crude oil natural gas and refined petroleum products which are influenced by numerous factors beyond our control historically these prices have been very volatile and most recently have been adversely affected by falling demand caused by the global economic downturn the major foreign oil producing countries including members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec exert considerable influence over the supply and price of crude oil and refined petroleum products their ability or inability to agree on a common policy on rates of production and other matters has a significant impact on the oil markets the commodities trading markets may also influence the selling prices of crude oil natural gas and refined petroleum products if crude oil and natural gas prices remain at yearend 2008 levels our revenues profitability and cash flow will be lower in 2009 compared with 2008 in addition if crude oil and natural gas prices decline further from yearend 2008 levels it could result in a reduction in the carrying value of our oil and gas assets proved oil and gas reserves deferred tax assets and goodwill to the extent that we engage in hedging activities to mitigate commodity price volatility we may not realize the benefit of price increases above the hedged price changes in commodity prices can also have a material impact on margin requirements under our derivative contracts 

 

technical risk we own or have access to a finite amount of oil and gas reserves which will be depleted over time replacement of oil and gas reserves is subject to successful exploration drilling development activities and enhanced recovery programs reserve replacement can also be achieved through acquisition therefore future oil and gas production is dependent on technical success in finding and developing additional hydrocarbon reserves exploration activity involves the interpretation of seismic and other geological and geophysical data which does not always successfully predict the presence of commercial quantities of hydrocarbons drilling risks include unexpected adverse conditions irregularities in pressure or formations equipment failure blowouts and weather interruptions future developments may be affected by unforeseen reservoir conditions which negatively affect recovery factors or flow rates the costs of drilling and development activities have increased in recent years which could negatively affect expected economic returns although due diligence is used in evaluating acquired oil and gas properties similar uncertainties may be encountered in the production of oil and gas on properties acquired from others 

 

oil and gas reserves and discounted future net cash flow risks numerous uncertainties exist in estimating quantities of proved reserves and future net revenues from those reserves actual future production oil and gas prices revenues taxes capital expenditures operating expenses geologic success and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates and could materially affect the estimated quantities and future net revenues of our proved reserves in addition reserve estimates may be subject to downward or upward revisions based on production performance purchases or sales of properties results of future development prevailing oil and gas prices production sharing contracts which may decrease reserves as crude oil and natural gas prices increase and other factors 

 

political risk federal state local territorial and foreign laws and regulations relating to tax increases and retroactive tax claims expropriation or nationalization of property mandatory government participation cancellation or amendment of contract rights and changes in import regulations limitations on access to exploration and development opportunities as well as other political developments may affect our operations some of the international areas in which we operate are politically less stable than our domestic operations in addition the threat of terrorism around the world poses additional risks to the operations of the oil and gas industry in our mr segment we market motor fuels through lesseedealers and wholesalers in certain states where legislation prohibits producers or refiners of crude oil from directly engaging in retail marketing of motor fuels similar legislation has been periodically proposed in the us congress and in various other states 

environmental risk our oil and gas operations like those of the industry are subject to environmental risk such as oil spills produced water spills gas leaks and ruptures and discharges of substances or gases that could expose us to substantial liability for pollution or other environmental damage our operations are also subject to numerous united states federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations noncompliance with these laws and regulations may subject us to administrative civil or criminal penalties remedial cleanups and natural resource damages or other liabilities in addition increasingly stringent environmental regulations particularly relating to the production of motor and other fuels and the potential for controls on greenhouse gas emissions have resulted and will likely continue to result in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us and the oil and gas industry in general 

 

competitive risk the petroleum industry is highly competitive and very capital intensive we encounter competition from numerous companies in each of our activities including acquiring rights to explore for crude oil and natural gas and in purchasing and marketing of refined products and natural gas many competitors including national oil companies are larger and have substantially greater resources we are also in competition with producers and marketers of other forms of energy increased competition for worldwide oil and gas assets has significantly increased the cost of acquisitions in addition competition for drilling services technical expertise and equipment has affected the availability of technical personnel and drilling rigs and has increased capital and operating costs 

 

catastrophic risk although we maintain a level of insurance coverage consistent with industry practices against property and casualty losses our oil and gas operations are subject to unforeseen occurrences which may damage or destroy assets or interrupt operations examples of catastrophic risks include hurricanes fires explosions and blowouts these occurrences have affected us from time to time during 2008 our annual gulf of mexico production of crude oil and natural gas was reduced by an estimated 7000 boepd due to the impact of hurricanes ike and gustav

 item 3   legal proceedings tableend  

the registrant along with many other companies engaged in refining and marketing of gasoline has been a party to lawsuits and claims related to the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe in gasoline a series of similar lawsuits many involving water utilities or governmental entities were filed in jurisdictions across the united states against producers of mtbe and petroleum refiners who produced gasoline containing mtbe including the registrant while the majority of the cases were settled in 2008 the registrant remains a defendant in approximately 20 cases these cases have been consolidated for pretrial purposes in the southern district of new york as part of a multidistrict litigation proceeding with the exception of an action brought in state court by the state of new hampshire the principal allegation in all cases is that gasoline containing mtbe is a defective product and that these parties are strictly liable in proportion to their share of the gasoline market for damage to groundwater resources and are required to take remedial action to ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of releases of mtbe the damages claimed in these actions are substantial and in almost all cases punitive damages are also sought in the fourth quarter 2007 the corporation recorded a pretax charge of 40 million related to mtbe litigation including amounts for the cases settled in 2008 

 

over the last several years many refiners have entered into consent agreements to resolve the united states environmental protection agency’s epa assertions that refining facilities were modified or expanded without complying with new source review regulations that require permits and new emission controls in certain circumstances and other regulations that impose emissions control requirements these consent agreements which arise out of an epa enforcement initiative focusing on petroleum refiners and utilities have typically imposed substantial civil fines and penalties and required i significant capital expenditures to install emissions control equipment over a three to eight year time period and ii changes to operations which resulted in increased operating costs the capital expenditures penalties and supplemental environmental projects for individual refineries covered by the settlements can vary significantly depending on the size and configuration of the refinery the circumstances of the alleged modifications and whether the refinery has previously installed more advanced pollution controls epa initially contacted registrant and hovensa regarding the petroleum refinery initiative in august 2003 negotiations with epa and the relevant states and the virgin islands are continuing and substantial progress has been made toward resolving this matter for both the corporation and hovensa while 

the effect on the corporation of the petroleum refining initiative cannot be estimated until a final settlement is reached and entered by a court additional future capital expenditures and operating expenses will likely be incurred over a number of years the amount of penalties if any is not expected to be material to the corporation 

 

on september 13 2007 hovensa received a notice of violation nov pursuant to section 113ai of the clean air act act from the epa finding that hovensa failed to obtain proper permitting for the construction and operation of its delayed coking unit in accordance with applicable law and regulations hovensa believes it properly obtained all necessary permits for this project the nov states that epa has authority to issue an administrative order assessing penalties for violation of the act hovensa has entered into discussions with the epa to reach resolution of this matter registrant does not believe that this matter will result in material liability to hovensa or registrant 

 

in december 2006 hovensa received a nov from the epa alleging noncompliance with emissions limits in a permit issued by the virgin islands department of planning and natural resources dpnr for the two process heaters in the delayed coking unit the nov was issued in response to a voluntary investigation and submission by hovensa regarding potential noncompliance with the permit emissions limits for two pollutants any exceedances were minor from the perspective of the amount of pollutants emitted in excess of the limits hovensa has entered into discussions with the appropriate governmental agencies to reach resolution of this matter and does not believe that it will result in material liability to hovensa or the corporation 

 

registrant received a directive from the new jersey department of environmental protection njdep to remediate contamination in the sediments of the lower passaic river and njdep is also seeking natural resource damages the directive insofar as it affects registrant relates to alleged releases from a petroleum bulk storage terminal in newark new jersey now owned by the registrant registrant and over 70 companies entered into an administrative order on consent with epa to study the same contamination njdep has also sued several other companies linked to a facility considered by the state to be the largest contributor to river contamination in january 2009 these companies added third party defendants including the registrant to that case in june 2007 epa issued a draft study which evaluated six alternatives for early action with costs ranging from 900 million to 23 billion based on adverse comments from registrant and others epa is reevaluating its alternatives in addition the federal trustees for natural resources have begun a separate assessment of damages to natural resources in the passaic river given the ongoing studies remedial costs cannot be reliably estimated at this time based on currently known facts and circumstances the registrant does not believe that this matter will result in material liability because its terminal could not have contributed contamination along most of the river’s length and did not store or use contaminants which are of the greatest concern in the river sediments and because there are numerous other parties who will likely share in the cost of remediation and damages 

 

in july 2004 hess oil virgin islands corp hovic a wholly owned subsidiary of the registrant and hovensa each received a letter from the commissioner of the virgin islands department of planning and natural resources and natural resources trustees advising of the trustee’s intention to bring suit against hovic and hovensa under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla the letter alleges that hovic and hovensa are potentially responsible for damages to natural resources arising from releases of hazardous substances from the “hovensa oil refinery” hovensa currently owns and operates a petroleum refinery on the south shore of st croix united states virgin islands which had been operated by hovic until october 1998 an action was filed on may 5 2005 in the district court of the virgin islands against hovensa hovic and other companies that operated industrial facilities on the south shore of st croix asserting that the defendants are liable under cercla and territorial statutory and common law for damages to natural resources hovic and hovensa do not believe that this matter will result in a material liability as they believe that they have strong defenses to this complaint and they intend to vigorously defend this matter 

 

the registrant periodically receives notices from epa that it is a “potential responsible party” under the superfund legislation with respect to various waste disposal sites under this legislation all potentially responsible parties are jointly and severally liable for certain sites epa’s claims or assertions of liability against the corporation relating to these sites have not been fully developed with respect to the remaining sites epa’s claims have been settled or a proposed settlement is under consideration in all cases for amounts that are not material the ultimate impact of these proceedings and of any related proceedings by private parties on the 

business or accounts of the corporation cannot be predicted at this time due to the large number of other potentially responsible parties and the speculative nature of cleanup cost estimates but is not expected to be material 

 

the securities and exchange commission sec notified the registrant that on july 21 2005 it commenced a private investigation into payments made to the government of equatorial guinea or to officials and persons affiliated with officials of the government of equatorial guinea the sec has requested documents and information from the registrant and other oil and gas companies that have operations or interests in equatorial guinea registrant has provided the documents and information requested 

 

the corporation is from time to time involved in other judicial and administrative proceedings including proceedings relating to other environmental matters although the ultimate outcome of these proceedings cannot be ascertained at this time and some of them may be resolved adversely to the corporation no such proceeding is required to be disclosed under applicable rules of the sec in management’s opinion based upon currently known facts and circumstances such proceedings in the aggregate will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the corporation

the corporation anticipates 32 billion in capital and exploratory expenditures in 2009 of which 31 billion relates to ep operations 

 

consolidated results of operations 

 

the aftertax results by major operating activity are summarized below 

 

 

 

 

in the discussion that follows the financial effects of certain transactions are disclosed on an aftertax basis management reviews segment earnings on an aftertax basis and uses aftertax amounts in its review of variances in segment earnings management believes that aftertax amounts are a preferable method of explaining variances in earnings since they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only the pretax amount aftertax amounts are determined by applying the income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pretax amounts 

 

the following table summarizes on an aftertax basis items of income expense that are included in net income and affect comparability between periods the items in the table below are explained and the pretax amounts are shown on pages 25 through 27 

 

 

 

comparison of results 

 

exploration and production 

 

following is a summarized income statement of the corporation’s exploration and production operations 

 

 

 

 

 

  

after considering the exploration and production items in the table on page 21 the remaining changes in exploration and production earnings are primarily attributable to changes in selling prices production volumes operating costs exploration expenses foreign exchange and income taxes as discussed below 

 

selling prices higher average selling prices increased exploration and production revenues by approximately 2100 million in 2008 compared with 2007 at december 31 2008 the selling prices of crude oil and natural gas had decreased significantly from the average 2008 selling prices indicated below in 2007 an increase in average crude oil selling prices and reduced hedge positions compared with 2006 increased revenues by approximately 740 million 

the corporation’s average selling prices were as follows 

 

 

 

 

the aftertax impacts of hedging reduced earnings by 423 million 685 million before income taxes in 2008 244 million 399 million before income taxes in 2007 and 285 million 449 million before income taxes in 2006 in october 2008 the corporation closed its brent crude oil hedge positions by entering into offsetting contracts with the same counterparty covering 24000 barrels per day from 2009 through 2012 at a per barrel price of 8695 each year the deferred aftertax loss as of the date the hedge positions were closed will be recorded in earnings as the contracts mature the estimated annual aftertax loss from the closed positions will be approximately 335 million from 2009 through 2012 the pretax amounts will continue to be recorded as a reduction of revenue and allocated to the selling prices of the corporation’s african production 

 

production and sales volumes the corporation’s crude oil and natural gas production was 381000 boepd in 2008 compared with 377000 boepd in 2007 and 359000 boepd in 2006 the corporation currently estimates that its 2009 production will average between 380000 and 390000 boepd 

the corporation’s net daily worldwide production was as follows 

 

 

 

 

  

united states crude oil production in the united states was higher in 2008 compared with 2007 principally due to production from new wells in north dakota and the deepwater gulf of mexico this increased production was partially offset by the impact of hurricanes in the gulf of mexico natural gas production was lower in 2008 primarily reflecting hurricane downtime and natural decline hurricane impacts reduced full year 2008 production by an estimated 7000 boepd at december 31 2008 approximately 15000 boepd remained shutin from the hurricanes and this production is expected to be brought back on line by the end of the first quarter of 2009 crude oil and natural gas production in 2007 decreased compared with 2006 principally due to natural decline and asset sales 

 

europe crude oil production in 2008 was lower than in 2007 due to temporary shutins at three north sea fields cessation of production at the mature fife fergus flora and angus fields and natural decline these decreases were partially offset by increased production in russia crude oil production in 2007 was lower than in 2006 reflecting natural decline facilities work on three north sea fields and the sale of the corporation’s interests in the scott and telford fields in the united kingdom partially offset by higher russian production natural gas production was comparable in 2008 and 2007 but decreased in 2007 compared with 2006 principally due to lower nominations related to the shutdown of a nonoperated pipeline and natural decline the decreases were partially offset by higher natural gas production from the atlantic and cromarty fields in the united kingdom which commenced in june 2006 

 

africa crude oil production increased in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to higher production at the okume complex in equatorial guinea partially offset by a lower entitlement to algerian production crude oil production increased in 2007 compared with 2006 primarily due to the startup of the okume complex in december 2006 

 

asia and other the change in crude oil production from 2006 through 2008 principally reflects changes to the corporation’s entitlement to production in azerbaijan the increase in 2007 compared with 2006 also reflects increased gross production from the fields in azerbaijan natural gas production increased in 2008 compared with 2007 due to increased production from block a18 in the joint development area of malaysia and thailand jda and a full year of production from the ujung pangkah field in indonesia higher natural gas 

production in 2007 compared with 2006 was principally due to new production from the sinphuhorm onshore gas project in thailand which commenced in november 2006 and production from the ujung pangkah field which commenced in april 2007 these increases were partially offset by the planned shutdown of the jda to install facilities required for phase 2 gas sales 

 

sales volumes higher sales volumes and other operating revenues increased revenue by approximately 200 million in 2008 compared with 2007 and 240 million in 2007 compared with 2006 

 

operating costs and depreciation depletion and amortization cash operating costs consisting of production expenses and general and administrative expenses increased by 321 million in 2008 and 409 million in 2007 compared with the corresponding amounts in prior years excluding the charges for hurricane related costs in 2008 and vacated leased office space in 2006 that are discussed below the increases in 2008 and 2007 were primarily due to higher production volumes increased production taxes due to higher realized selling prices increased costs of services and materials and higher employee costs cash operating costs per barrel of oil equivalent were 1549 in 2008 1336 in 2007 and 1092 in 2006 cash operating costs in 2009 are estimated to be in the range of 1500 to 1600 per barrel of oil equivalent 

 

excluding the pretax amount of asset impairments depreciation depletion and amortization charges increased by 531 million and 232 million in 2008 and 2007 respectively the increases were primarily due to higher production volumes and per barrel costs depreciation depletion and amortization costs per barrel of oil equivalent were 1379 in 2008 1011 in 2007 and 885 in 2006 depreciation depletion and amortization costs for 2009 are estimated to be in the range of 1300 to 1400 per barrel 

 

exploration expenses exploration expenses were higher in 2008 compared with 2007 principally due to higher dry hole costs exploration expenses were lower in 2007 compared with 2006 primarily reflecting lower dry hole costs partially offset by increased seismic studies 

 

income taxes after considering the items in the table below the effective income tax rates for exploration and production operations were 49 in 2008 50 in 2007 and 54 in 2006 the effective income tax rate for ep operations in 2009 is estimated to be in the range of 57 to 61 the increase from the 2008 effective rate largely reflects the impact of libyan taxes in a lower commodity price environment 

 

foreign exchange the aftertax foreign currency loss was 84 million in 2008 compared with a loss of 7 million in 2007 and a gain of 10 million in 2006 the increased foreign currency loss reflects the effect of significant exchange rate movements in the fourth quarter of 2008 on the remeasurement of assets liabilities and foreign currency forward contracts by certain foreign businesses 

 

reported exploration and production earnings include the following items of income expense before and after income taxes 

 

 

 

 

2008 the charge for asset impairments relates to mature fields in the united states and the united kingdom north sea the pretax amount of this charge is reflected in depreciation depletion and amortization the hurricane costs relate to expenses associated with hurricanes gustav and ike in the gulf of mexico and are recorded in production expenses 

2007 the gain from asset sales relates to the sale of the corporation’s interests in the scott and telford fields in the united kingdom north sea the charge for asset impairments relates to two mature fields also in the united kingdom north sea the estimated production imbalance settlements represent a charge for adjustments to prior meter readings at two offshore fields which are recorded as a reduction of sales and other operating revenues 

 

2006 the gains from asset sales relate to the sale of certain united states oil and gas producing properties located in the permian basin in texas and new mexico and onshore gulf coast the accrued office closing cost relates to vacated leased office space in the united kingdom the related expenses are reflected principally in general and administrative expenses the income tax adjustment represents a onetime adjustment to the corporation’s deferred tax liability resulting from an increase in the supplementary tax on petroleum operations in the united kingdom from 10 to 20 

 

the corporation’s future exploration and production earnings may be impacted by external factors such as political risk volatility in the selling prices of crude oil and natural gas reserve and production changes industry cost inflation exploration expenses the effects of weather and changes in foreign exchange and income tax rates 

 

marketing and refining 

 

earnings from marketing and refining activities amounted to 277 million in 2008 300 million in 2007 and 394 million in 2006 after considering the liquidation of lifo inventories reflected in the table on page 21 and discussed below the earnings were 277 million 276 million and 394 million respectively 

 

refining refining earnings which consist of the corporation’s share of hovensa’s results port reading earnings interest income on a note receivable from pdvsa and results of other miscellaneous operating activities were 73 million in 2008 193 million in 2007 and 240 million in 2006 

 

the corporation’s share of hovensa’s net income was 27 million 44 million before income taxes in 2008 108 million 176 million before income taxes in 2007 and 124 million 201 million before income taxes in 2006 the lower earnings in 2008 and 2007 compared with the respective prior years were principally due to lower refining margins the 2008 utilization rate for the fluid catalytic cracking unit at hovensa reflects lower utilization due to weak refining margins planned and unplanned maintenance of certain units and a refinery wide shut down for hurricane omar in 2007 the coker unit at hovensa was shutdown for approximately 30 days for a scheduled turnaround certain related processing units were also included in this turnaround in 2006 the fluid catalytic cracking unit at hovensa was shutdown for approximately 22 days of unscheduled maintenance cash distributions received by the corporation from hovensa were 50 million in 2008 300 million in 2007 and 400 million in 2006 

 

pretax interest income on the pdvsa note was 4 million 9 million and 15 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively interest income is reflected in other income in the income statement at december 31 2008 the remaining balance of the pdvsa note was 15 million which was fully repaid in february 2009 

 

port reading and other aftertax refining earnings were 43 million in 2008 79 million in 2007 and 107 million in 2006 also reflecting lower refining margins

marketing marketing operations which consist principally of retail gasoline and energy marketing activities generated income of 240 million in 2008 59 million in 2007 and 108 million in 2006 excluding income from the liquidation of lifo inventories in 2007 totaling 38 million before income taxes 24 million after income taxes 

 

the increase in 2008 primarily reflects higher margins on refined product sales including sales of retail gasoline operations refined product margins were lower in 2007 compared with 2006 total refined product sales volumes were 472000 barrels per day in 2008 451000 barrels per day in 2007 and 459000 barrels per day in 2006 total energy marketing natural gas sales volumes including utility and spot sales were approximately 20 million mcf per day in 2008 19 million mcf per day in 2007 and 18 million mcf per day in 2006 in addition energy marketing sold electricity volumes at the rate of 3200 2800 and 1400 megawatts round the clock in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively 

 

the corporation has a 50 voting interest in a consolidated partnership that trades energy commodities and energy derivatives the corporation also takes trading positions for its own account the corporation’s aftertax results from trading activities including its share of the earnings of the trading partnership amounted to a loss of 36 million in 2008 compared with earnings of 24 million in 2007 and 46 million in 2006 

 

marketing expenses increased in 2008 principally reflecting growth in energy marketing activities higher credit card fees in retail gasoline operations and increased transportation costs 

 

the corporation’s future marketing and refining earnings may be impacted by external factors including volatility in margins competitive industry conditions government regulations credit risk and supply and demand factors including the effects of weather 

 

corporate 

 

the following table summarizes corporate expenses 

 

 

 

 

excluding the item affecting comparability between periods the increase in corporate expenses in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily reflects losses on pension related investments higher employee costs and higher professional fees the increase in net corporate expenses in 2007 compared with 2006 principally reflects higher employee costs including stock based compensation recurring aftertax corporate expenses in 2009 are estimated to be in the range of 165 to 175 million 

 

in 2007 corporate expenses include a charge of 25 million 40 million before income taxes related to mtbe litigation the pretax amount of this charge is recorded in general and administrative expenses 

interest 

 

aftertax interest expense was as follows 

 

 

 

 

the decrease in interest incurred in 2008 principally reflects lower average debt the decrease in capitalized interest in 2008 reflects the completion of several development projects in 2007 and 2006 interest expense in each period includes the cost of letters of credit primarily issued to counterparties in hedging and trading activities aftertax interest expense in 2009 is expected to be in the range of 230 to 240 million see future capital requirements and resources for discussion of a 1250 million note issuance in the first quarter of 2009

accounting policies 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

accounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of assets and liabilities on the corporation’s balance sheet and revenues and expenses on the income statement the accounting methods used can affect net income stockholders’ equity and various financial statement ratios however the corporation’s accounting policies generally do not change cash flows or liquidity 

 

accounting for exploration and development costs exploration and production activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage including lease bonuses brokers’ fees and other related costs are capitalized annual lease rentals exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred costs of drilling and equipping productive wells including development dry holes and related production facilities are capitalized 

 

the costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if 1 the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and 2 sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project if either of those criteria is not met or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project the 

capitalized well costs are charged to expense indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves and the economic and operating viability of a project include commitment of project personnel active negotiations for sales contracts with customers negotiations with governments operators and contractors and firm plans for additional drilling and other factors 

 

crude oil and natural gas reserves the determination of estimated proved reserves is a significant element in arriving at the results of operations of exploration and production activities the estimates of proved reserves affect well capitalizations the unit of production depreciation rates of proved properties and wells and equipment as well as impairment testing of oil and gas assets and goodwill 

 

the corporation’s oil and gas reserves are calculated in accordance with sec regulations and interpretations and the requirements of the financial accounting standards board for reserves to be booked as proved they must be commercially producible government and project operator approvals must be obtained and depending on the amount of the project cost senior management or the board of directors must commit to fund the project the corporation’s oil and gas reserve estimation and reporting process involves an annual independent third party reserve determination as well as internal technical appraisals of reserves the corporation maintains its own internal reserve estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work directly with the oil and gas properties the corporation’s technical staff updates reserve estimates throughout the year based on evaluations of new wells performance reviews new technical data and other studies to provide consistency throughout the corporation standard reserve estimation guidelines definitions reporting reviews and approval practices are used the internal reserve estimates are subject to internal technical audits and senior management review 

 

the oil and gas reserve estimates reported in the supplementary oil and gas data in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards fas 69 disclosures about oil and gas producing activities fas 69 are determined independently by the consulting firm of degolyer and macnaughton dm and are consistent with internal estimates annually the corporation provides dm with engineering geological and geophysical data actual production histories and other information necessary for the reserve determination the corporation’s and dm’s technical staffs meet to review and discuss the information provided senior management and the board of directors review the final reserve estimates issued by dm 

 

on december 31 2008 the securities and exchange commission published a final rule which revises its oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure requirements the revisions are effective for filings on form 10k for fiscal years ending december 31 2009 the corporation is evaluating the impact of these requirements on its oil and gas reserve estimates and disclosures 

 

impairment of longlived assets and goodwill as explained below there are significant differences in the way longlived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing the corporation reviews longlived assets including oil and gas fields for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered longlived assets are tested based on identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities if the carrying amounts of the longlived assets are not expected to be recovered by undiscounted future net cash flow estimates the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded the amount of impairment is based on the estimated fair value of the assets generally determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows 

 

in the case of oil and gas fields the present value of future net cash flows is based on management’s best estimate of future prices which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices applied to projected production volumes and discounted at a riskadjusted rate the projected production volumes represent reserves including probable reserves expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures the production volumes prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairments will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows since the standardized measure requires the use of actual prices on the last day of the year 

 

the corporation’s impairment tests of longlived exploration and production producing assets are based on its best estimates of future production volumes including recovery factors selling prices operating and capital costs the timing of future production and other factors which are updated each time an impairment test is performed the 

corporation could have impairments if the projected production volumes from oil and gas fields decrease crude oil and natural gas selling prices decline significantly for an extended period or future estimated capital and operating costs increase significantly 

 

in accordance with fas 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  the corporation’s goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level which is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment the impairment test is conducted annually in the fourth quarter or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable the reporting unit or units used to evaluate and measure goodwill for impairment are determined primarily from the manner in which the business is managed the corporation’s goodwill is assigned to the exploration and production operating segment and it expects that the benefits of goodwill will be recovered through the operation of that segment 

 

the corporation’s fair value estimate of the exploration and production segment is the sum of 1 the discounted anticipated cash flows of producing assets and known developments 2 the estimated risk adjusted present value of exploration assets and 3 an estimated market premium to reflect the market price an acquirer would pay for potential synergies including cost savings access to new business opportunities enterprise control improved processes and increased market share the corporation also considers the relative market valuation of similar exploration and production companies 

 

the determination of the fair value of the exploration and production operating segment depends on estimates about oil and gas reserves future prices timing of future net cash flows and market premiums significant extended declines in crude oil and natural gas prices or reduced reserve estimates could lead to a decrease in the fair value of the exploration and production operating segment that could result in an impairment of goodwill 

 

because there are significant differences in the way longlived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing there may be impairments of individual assets that would not cause an impairment of the goodwill assigned to the exploration and production segment 

 

asset retirement obligations the corporation has material legal obligations to remove and dismantle long lived assets and to restore land or seabed at certain exploration and production locations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles the corporation recognizes a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations in addition the fair value of any legally required conditional asset retirement obligations is recorded if the liability can be reasonably estimated the corporation capitalizes such costs as a component of the carrying amount of the underlying assets in the period in which the liability is incurred in order to measure these obligations the corporation estimates the fair value of the obligations by discounting the future payments that will be required to satisfy the obligations in determining these estimates the corporation is required to make several assumptions and judgments related to the scope of dismantlement timing of settlement interpretation of legal requirements inflationary factors and discount rate in addition there are other external factors which could significantly affect the ultimate settlement costs for these obligations including changes in environmental regulations and other statutory requirements fluctuations in industry costs and foreign currency exchange rates and advances in technology as a result the corporation’s estimates of asset retirement obligations are subject to revision due to the factors described above changes in estimates prior to settlement result in adjustments to both the liability and related asset values 

 

derivatives the corporation utilizes derivative instruments for both nontrading and trading activities in nontrading activities the corporation uses futures forwards options and swaps individually or in combination to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in the prices of crude oil natural gas refined products and electricity and changes in foreign currency exchange rates in trading activities the corporation principally through a consolidated partnership trades energy commodities and derivatives including futures forwards options and swaps based on expectations of future market conditions 

 

all derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in the corporation’s balance sheet the corporation’s policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative the changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges under fas 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  are recognized currently in earnings derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions cash flow hedges or hedges of firm commitments fair 

value hedges the effective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income loss amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings the ineffective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recorded currently in earnings changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings the change in fair value of the related hedged commitment is recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized currently in earnings 

 

derivatives that are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges are tested for effectiveness prospectively before they are executed and both prospectively and retrospectively on an ongoing basis to determine whether they continue to qualify for hedge accounting the prospective and retrospective effectiveness calculations are performed using either historical simulation or other statistical models which utilize historical observable market data consisting of futures curves and spot prices 

 

fair value measurements the corporation’s derivative instruments and supplemental pension plan investments are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings or other comprehensive income each period in determining fair value the corporation uses various valuation approaches including the market and income approaches the corporation’s fair value measurements also include nonperformance risk and time value of money considerations counterparty credit is considered for receivable balances and the corporation’s credit is considered for accrued liabilities 

 

the corporation adopted the provisions of fas 157 fair value measurements fas 157 effective january 1 2008 fas 157 establishes a hierarchy for the inputs used to measure fair value based on the source of the input which generally range from quoted prices for identical instruments in a principal trading market level 1 to estimates determined using related market data level 3 multiple inputs may be used to measure fair value however the level of fair value for each financial asset or liability is based on the lowest significant input level within this fair value hierarchy details on the methods and assumptions used to determine the fair values of the financial assets and liabilities are as follows  

 

fair value measurements based on level 1 inputs 

 

measurements that are most observable are based on quoted prices of identical instruments obtained from the principal markets in which they are traded closing prices are both readily available and representative of fair value market transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to assure liquidity the fair value of certain of the corporation’s exchange traded futures and options are considered level 1 in addition fair values for the majority of the corporation’s supplemental pension plan investments are considered level 1 since they are determined using quotations from national securities exchanges 

 

fair value measurements based on level 2 inputs 

 

measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered level 2 measurements based on level 2 inputs include overthecounter derivative instruments that are priced on an exchange traded curve but have contractual terms that are not identical to exchange traded contracts the corporation utilizes fair value measurements based on level 2 inputs for certain forwards swaps and options the liability related to the corporation’s crude oil hedges is classified as level 2 

 

fair value measurements based on level 3 inputs 

 

measurements that are least observable are estimated from related market data determined from sources with little or no market activity for comparable contracts or are positions with longer durations for example in its energy marketing business the corporation sells natural gas and electricity to customers and offsets the price exposure by purchasing forward contracts the fair value of these sales and purchases may be based on specific prices at less liquid delivered locations which are classified as level 3 

 

income taxes judgments are required in the determination and recognition of income tax assets and liabilities in the financial statements these judgements include the requirement to only recognize the financial statement effect of a tax position when management believes that it is more likely than not that based on the technical merits the position will be sustained upon examination 

the corporation has net operating loss carryforwards or credit carryforwards in several jurisdictions including the united states and has recorded deferred tax assets for those losses and credits additionally the corporation has deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized in evaluating realizability of deferred tax assets the corporation refers to the reversal periods for temporary differences available carryforward periods for net operating losses and credit carryforwards estimates of future taxable income the availability of tax planning strategies the existence of appreciated assets and other factors estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas reserves and selling prices that are consistent with the corporation’s internal business forecasts the corporation does not provide for deferred us income taxes applicable to undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations 

 

retirement plans the corporation has funded noncontributory defined benefit pension plans and an unfunded supplemental pension plan in accordance with fas 158 employer’s accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans fas 158 the corporation recognizes on the balance sheet the net change in the funded status of the projected benefit obligation for these plans 

 

the determination of the obligations and expenses related to these plans are based on several actuarial assumptions the most significant of which relate to the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations expected longterm rates of return on plan assets and rate of future increases in compensation levels these assumptions represent estimates made by the corporation some of which can be affected by external factors for example the discount rate used to estimate the corporation’s projected benefit obligation is based on a portfolio of highquality fixedincome debt instruments with maturities that approximate the expected payment of plan obligations while the expected return on plan assets is developed from the expected future returns for each asset category weighted by the target allocation of pension assets to that asset category changes in these assumptions can have a material impact on the amounts reported in the corporation’s financial statements 

 

changes in accounting policies 

 

as discussed on page 35 the corporation adopted fas 157 effective january 1 2008 the impact of adopting fas 157 was not material to the corporation’s results of operations upon adoption the corporation recorded a reduction in the net deferred hedge losses reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income which increased stockholders’ equity by 193 million after income taxes 

 

effective december 31 2008 the corporation applied the provisions of emerging issues task force 085  issuer’s accounting for liabilities measured at fair value with a thirdparty credit enhancement eitf 085 upon adoption the corporation revalued certain derivative liabilities collateralized by letters of credit to reflect the corporation’s credit rating rather than the credit rating of the issuing bank the adoption resulted in an increase in sales and other operating revenues of approximately 13 million and an increase in other comprehensive income of approximately 78 million with a corresponding decrease in derivative liabilities recorded within accounts payable 

 

recently issued accounting standard 

 

in december 2007 the fasb issued fas 160 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statementsan amendment of arb no 51 fas 160 fas 160 changes the accounting for and reporting of noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary the corporation will adopt the provisions of fas 160 effective january 1 2009 and estimates that adoption will result in a decrease in other long term liabilities and an increase in stockholders’ equity of approximately 85 million 

 

environment health and safety 

 

the corporation has implemented a valuesbased sociallyresponsible strategy focused on improving environment health and safety performance and making a positive impact on communities the strategy is supported by the corporation’s environment health safety and social responsibility ehs  sr policies and by 

environment and safety management systems that help protect the corporation’s workforce customers and local communities the corporation’s management systems are designed to uphold or exceed international standards and are intended to promote internal consistency adherence to policy objectives and continual improvement in ehs  sr performance improved performance may in the shortterm increase the corporation’s operating costs and could also require increased capital expenditures to reduce potential risks to assets reputation and license to operate in addition to enhanced ehs  sr performance improved productivity and operational efficiencies may be realized as collateral benefits from investments in ehs  sr the corporation has programs in place to evaluate regulatory compliance audit facilities train employees prevent and manage risks and emergencies and to generally meet corporate ehs  sr goals 

 

the corporation and hovensa produce and the corporation distributes fuel oils in the united states proposals by state regulatory agencies and legislatures have been made that would require a lower sulfur content of fuel oils if adopted these proposals could require capital expenditures by the registrant and hovensa to meet the required sulfur content standards 

 

as described in item 3 “legal proceedings” in 2003 the corporation and hovensa began discussions with the us epa regarding the epa’s petroleum refining initiative pri the pri is an ongoing program that is designed to reduce certain air emissions at all us refineries since 2000 the epa has entered into settlements addressing these emissions with petroleum refining companies that control nearly 90 of the domestic refining capacity negotiations with the epa are continuing and substantial progress has been made toward resolving this matter for both the corporation and hovensa while the effect on the corporation of the petroleum refining initiative cannot be estimated until a final settlement is reached and entered by a court additional future capital expenditures and operating expenses will likely be incurred over a number of years the amount of penalties if any is not expected to be material to the corporation 

 

the corporation has undertaken a program to assess monitor and reduce the emission of “greenhouse gases” including carbon dioxide and methane the corporation recognizes that climate change is a global environmental concern with potentially significant consequences for society and the energy industry the corporation is committed to the responsible management of greenhouse gas emissions from our existing assets and future developments and is developing and implementing a strategy to control our carbon emissions 

 

the corporation will have continuing expenditures for environmental assessment and remediation sites where corrective action may be necessary include gasoline stations terminals onshore exploration and production facilities refineries including solid waste management units under permits issued pursuant to the resource conservation and recovery act and although not currently significant “superfund” sites where the corporation has been named a potentially responsible party 

 

the corporation accrues for environmental assessment and remediation expenses when the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable at yearend 2008 the corporation’s reserve for estimated environmental liabilities was approximately 61 million the corporation expects that existing reserves for environmental liabilities will adequately cover costs to assess and remediate known sites the corporation’s remediation spending was 23 million in 2008 23 million in 2007 and 15 million in 2006 capital expenditures for facilities primarily to comply with federal state and local environmental standards other than for the low sulfur requirements were 15 million in 2008 and 22 million in 2007 and 2006

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

in the normal course of its business the corporation is exposed to commodity risks related to changes in the price of crude oil natural gas refined products and electricity as well as to changes in interest rates and foreign currency values in the disclosures that follow these operations are referred to as nontrading activities the corporation also has trading operations principally through a 50 voting interest in a consolidated partnership that trades energy commodities these activities are also exposed to commodity risks primarily related to the prices of crude oil natural gas and refined products the following describes how these risks are controlled and managed 

 

controls the corporation maintains a control environment under the direction of its chief risk officer and through its corporate risk policy which the corporation’s senior management has approved controls include volumetric term and valueatrisk limits in addition the chief risk officer must approve the use of new instruments or commodities risk limits are monitored daily and exceptions are reported to business units and to senior management the corporation’s risk management department also performs independent verifications of sources of fair values and validations of valuation models these controls apply to all of the corporation’s nontrading and trading activities including the consolidated trading partnership the corporation’s treasury department is responsible for administering foreign exchange rate and interest rate hedging programs 

 

instruments the corporation primarily uses forward commodity contracts foreign exchange forward contracts futures swaps options and energy commodity based securities in its nontrading and trading activities these contracts are generally widely traded instruments with standardized terms the following describes these instruments and how the corporation uses them 

 

 38 

 

valueatrisk the corporation uses valueatrisk to monitor and control commodity risk within its trading and nontrading activities the valueatrisk model uses historical simulation and the results represent the potential loss in fair value over one day at a 95 confidence level the model captures both first and second order sensitivities for options the following table summarizes the valueatrisk results for trading and nontrading activities these results may vary from time to time as strategies change in trading activities or hedging levels change in nontrading activities 

 

 

 

 

nontrading the corporation’s nontrading activities may include hedging of crude oil and natural gas production futures and swaps are used to fix the selling prices of a portion of the corporation’s future production and the related gains or losses are an integral part of the corporation’s selling prices in october 2008 the corporation closed its brent crude oil hedge positions by entering into offsetting contracts with the same counterparty covering 24000 barrels per day from 2009 through 2012 at a per barrel price of 8695 each year the aftertax deferred losses related to closed crude oil contracts will be recorded in earnings as the contracts mature 

 

there were no hedges of wti crude oil or natural gas production at december 31 2008 the corporation also markets energy commodities including refined petroleum products natural gas and electricity the corporation uses futures swaps and options to manage the risk in its marketing activities accumulated other comprehensive income loss at december 31 2008 includes aftertax deferred losses of 1478 million primarily related to closed crude oil contracts that were used as hedges of exploration and production sales 

 

the corporation uses foreign exchange contracts to reduce its exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates by entering into forward contracts for various currencies including the british pound the norwegian krone and the danish krone at december 31 2008 the corporation had 896 million of notional value foreign exchange contracts maturing in 2009 the fair value of the foreign exchange contracts was a payable of 75 million at december 31 2008 the change in fair value of the foreign exchange contracts from a 20 change in exchange rates is estimated to be approximately 165 million at december 31 2008 

 

the corporation’s outstanding debt of 3955 million has a fair value of 3883 million at december 31 2008 a 15 decrease in the rate of interest would increase the fair value of debt by approximately 85 million at december 31 2008

 item 1a   risk factors related to our business and operations tableend  

our business activities and the value of our securities are subject to significant risk factors including those described below the risk factors described below could negatively affect our operations financial condition liquidity and results of operations and as a result holders and purchasers of our securities could lose part or all of their investments it is possible additional risks relating to our securities may be described in a prospectus supplement if we issue securities in the future 

 

commodity price risk our estimated proved reserves revenue operating cash flows operating margins future earnings and trading operations are highly dependent on the prices of crude oil natural gas and refined petroleum products which are influenced by numerous factors beyond our control historically these prices have been very volatile the major foreign oil producing countries including members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec exert considerable influence over the supply and price of crude oil and refined petroleum products their ability or inability to agree on a common policy on rates of production and other matters has a significant impact on the oil markets the commodities trading markets may also influence the selling prices of crude oil natural gas and refined petroleum products a significant downward trend in commodity prices would have a material adverse effect on our revenues profitability and cash flow and could result in a reduction in the carrying value of our oil and gas assets goodwill and proved oil and gas reserves to the extent that we engage in hedging activities to mitigate commodity price volatility we will not realize the benefit of price increases above the hedged price 

 

technical risk we own or have access to a finite amount of oil and gas reserves which will be depleted over time replacement of oil and gas reserves is subject to successful exploration drilling development activities and enhanced recovery programs therefore future oil and gas production is dependent on technical success in finding and developing additional hydrocarbon reserves exploration activity involves the interpretation of seismic and other geological and geophysical data which does not always successfully predict the presence of commercial quantities of hydrocarbons drilling risks include adverse unexpected conditions irregularities in pressure or formations equipment failure blowouts and weather interruptions future developments may be affected by unforeseen reservoir conditions which negatively affect recovery factors or flow rates the costs of drilling and development activities have also been increasing which could negatively affect expected economic returns although due diligence is used in evaluating acquired oil and gas properties similar uncertainties may be encountered in the production of oil and gas on properties acquired from others 

 

oil and gas reserves and discounted future net cash flow risks numerous uncertainties exist in estimating quantities of proved reserves and future net revenues from those reserves actual future production oil and gas prices revenues taxes capital expenditures operating expenses geologic success and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates and could materially affect the estimated quantities and future net revenues of our proved reserves in addition reserve estimates may be subject to downward or upward revisions based on production performance purchases or sales of properties results of future development prevailing oil and gas prices production sharing contracts which may decrease reserves as crude oil and natural gas prices increase and other factors 

 

political risk federal state local territorial and foreign laws and regulations relating to tax increases and retroactive tax claims expropriation of property mandatory government participation cancellation or amendment of contract rights and changes in import regulations as well as other political developments may affect our operations some of the international areas in which we operate may be politically less stable than our domestic operations in addition the increasing threat of terrorism around the world poses additional risks to the operations of the oil and gas industry in our mr segment we market motor fuels through lesseedealers and wholesalers in 

certain states where legislation prohibits producers or refiners of crude oil from directly engaging in retail marketing of motor fuels similar legislation has been periodically proposed in the us congress and in various other states 

 

environmental risk our oil and gas operations like those of the industry are subject to environmental hazards such as oil spills produced water spills gas leaks and ruptures and discharges of substances or gases that could expose us to substantial liability for pollution or other environmental damage our operations are also subject to numerous united states federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations noncompliance with these laws and regulations may subject us to administrative civil or criminal penalties remedial cleanups and natural resource damages or other liabilities in addition increasingly stringent environmental regulations particularly relating to the production of motor and other fuels and the potential for controls on greenhouse gas emissions have resulted and will likely continue to result in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us and the oil and gas industry in general 

 

competitive risk the petroleum industry is highly competitive and very capital intensive we encounter competition from numerous companies in each of our activities including acquiring rights to explore for crude oil and natural gas and in purchasing and marketing of refined products and natural gas many competitors including national oil companies are larger and have substantially greater resources we are also in competition with producers and marketers of other forms of energy increased competition for worldwide oil and gas assets has significantly increased the cost of acquisitions in addition competition for drilling services technical expertise and equipment has affected the availability of technical personnel and drilling rigs and has increased capital and operating costs 

 

catastrophic risk although we maintain a level of insurance coverage consistent with industry practices against property and casualty losses our oil and gas operations are subject to unforeseen occurrences which may damage or destroy assets or interrupt operations examples of catastrophic risks include hurricanes fires explosions and blowouts these occurrences have affected us from time to time during 2005 our annual gulf of mexico production of crude oil and natural gas was reduced by 7000 barrels of oil equivalent per day boepd due to the impact of hurricanes katrina and rita

 item 3   legal proceedings tableend  

the registrant along with many other companies engaged in refining and marketing of gasoline has been a party to lawsuits and claims related to the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe in gasoline a series of substantially identical lawsuits many involving water utilities or governmental entities were filed in jurisdictions across the united states against producers of mtbe and petroleum refiners who produce gasoline containing mtbe including the registrant these cases have been consolidated in the southern district of new york and as of the end of 2007 the registrant is named as a defendant in 51 of approximately 80 cases pending the principal allegation in all cases is that gasoline containing mtbe is a defective product and that these parties are strictly liable in proportion to their share of the gasoline market for damage to groundwater resources and are required to take remedial action to ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of releases of mtbe the damages claimed in these actions are substantial and in some cases punitive damages are also sought in april 2005 the district court denied the primary legal aspects of the defendants’ motion to dismiss these actions as a result of courtordered mediation the registrant anticipates that settlement will be reached in a number of the pending cases the number and terms of which are currently being negotiated and are subject to a confidentiality agreement in the fourth quarter 2007 the registrant recorded a pretax charge of 40 million related to mtbe litigation 

 

over the last several years many refiners have entered into consent agreements to resolve the united states environmental protection agency’s epa assertions that refining facilities were modified or expanded without complying with new source review regulations that require permits and new emission controls in certain circumstances and other regulations that impose emissions control requirements these consent agreements which arise out of an epa enforcement initiative focusing on petroleum refiners and utilities have typically imposed substantial civil fines and penalties and required i significant capital expenditures to install emissions control equipment over a three to eight year time period and ii changes to operations which resulted in increased operating costs the capital expenditures penalties and supplemental environmental projects for individual 

refineries covered by the settlements can vary significantly depending on the size and configuration of the refinery the circumstances of the alleged modifications and whether the refinery has previously installed more advanced pollution controls epa initially contacted registrant and hovensa llc hovensa its 50 owned joint venture with petroleos de venezuela which owns and operates a refinery in the us virgin islands regarding the petroleum refinery initiative in august 2003 and discussions resumed in august 2005 the registrant and hovensa have had and expect to have further discussions with the epa regarding the petroleum refining initiative although both the registrant and hovensa have already installed many of the pollution controls required of other refiners under the consent agreements while the effect on the corporation of the petroleum refining initiative cannot be estimated at this time additional future capital expenditures and operating expenses may be incurred the amount of penalties if any is not expected to be material to the corporation negotiations with epa are continuing and substantial progress has been made toward resolving this matter 

 

on september 13 2007 hovensa received a notice of violation nov pursuant to section 113ai of the clean air act act from the united states environmental protection agency epa finding that hovensa failed to obtain proper permitting for the construction and operation of its delayed coking unit in accordance with applicable law and regulations hovensa believes it properly obtained all necessary permits for this project the nov states that epa has authority to issue an administrative order assessing penalties for violation of the act however hovensa intends to enter into discussions with the epa to reach resolution of this matter registrant does not believe that this matter will result in material liability to hovensa or registrant 

 

in december 2006 hovensa received a nov from the epa alleging noncompliance with emissions limits in a permit issued by the virgin islands department of planning and natural resources dpnr for the two process heaters in the delayed coking unit the nov was issued in response to a voluntary investigation and submission by hovensa regarding potential noncompliance with the permit emissions limits for two pollutants any exceedances were minor from the perspective of the amount of pollutants emitted in excess of the limits hovensa intends to work with the appropriate governmental agency to reach resolution of this matter and does not believe that it will result in material liability 

 

registrant is one of over 60 companies that have received a directive from the new jersey department of environmental protection njdep to remediate contamination in the sediments of the lower passaic river and njdep is also seeking natural resource damages the directive insofar as it affects registrant relates to alleged releases from a petroleum bulk storage terminal in newark new jersey now owned by the registrant registrant and over 40 companies entered into an administrative order on consent with epa to study the same contamination in june 2007 epa issued a draft study which evaluated six alternatives for early action with costs ranging from 900 million to 23 billion based on adverse comments from registrant and others epa is reevaluating its alternatives in addition the federal trustees for natural resources have begun a separate assessment of damages to natural resources in the passaic river given the ongoing studies remedial costs cannot be reliably estimated at this time based on currently known facts and circumstances the registrant does not believe that this matter will result in material liability because its terminal could not have contributed contamination along most of the river’s length and did not store or use contaminants which are of the greatest concern in the river sediments and because there are numerous other parties who will likely share in the cost of remediation and damages 

 

in july 2004 hess oil virgin islands corp hovic a wholly owned subsidiary of the registrant and hovensa each received a letter from the commissioner of the virgin islands department of planning and natural resources and natural resources trustees advising of the trustee’s intention to bring suit against hovic and hovensa under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla the letter alleges that hovic and hovensa are potentially responsible for damages to natural resources arising from releases of hazardous substances from the “hovensa oil refinery” hovensa currently owns and operates a petroleum refinery on the south shore of st croix united states virgin islands which had been operated by hovic until october 1998 an action was filed on may 5 2005 in the district court of the virgin islands against hovensa hovic and other companies that operated industrial facilities on the south shore of st croix asserting that the defendants are liable under cercla and territorial statutory and common law for damages to natural resources hovic and hovensa do not believe that this matter will result in a material liability as they believe that they have strong defenses to this complaint and they intend to vigorously defend this matter 

registrant has been served with a complaint from the new york state department of environmental conservation dec relating to alleged violations at its petroleum terminal in brooklyn new york the complaint which seeks an order to shut down the terminal and penalties in unspecified amounts alleges violations involving the structural integrity of certain tanks the erosion of shorelines and bulkheads petroleum discharges and improper certification of tank repairs dec is also seeking relief relating to remediation of certain gasoline stations in the new york metropolitan area registrant and dec have reached a settlement in principle which is expected to be finalized in early 2008 any settlement is not expected to be material to the corporation 

 

the registrant periodically receives notices from epa that it is a “potential responsible party” under the superfund legislation with respect to various waste disposal sites under this legislation all potentially responsible parties are jointly and severally liable for certain sites epa’s claims or assertions of liability against the corporation relating to these sites have not been fully developed with respect to the remaining sites epa’s claims have been settled or a proposed settlement is under consideration in all cases for amounts that are not material the ultimate impact of these proceedings and of any related proceedings by private parties on the business or accounts of the corporation cannot be predicted at this time due to the large number of other potentially responsible parties and the speculative nature of cleanup cost estimates but is not expected to be material 

 

the securities and exchange commission sec has notified the registrant that on july 21 2005 it commenced a private investigation into payments made to the government of equatorial guinea or to officials and persons affiliated with officials of the government of equatorial guinea the staff of the sec has requested documents and information from the registrant and other oil and gas companies that have operations or interests in equatorial guinea the staff of the sec had previously been conducting an informal inquiry into such matters the registrant has been cooperating and continues to cooperate with the sec investigation 

 

the corporation is from time to time involved in other judicial and administrative proceedings including proceedings relating to other environmental matters although the ultimate outcome of these proceedings cannot be ascertained at this time and some of them may be resolved adversely to the corporation no such proceeding is required to be disclosed under applicable rules of the securities and exchange commission in management’s opinion based upon currently known facts and circumstances such proceedings in the aggregate will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the corporation

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend  

overview 

 

the corporation is a global integrated energy company that operates in two segments exploration and production ep and marketing and refining mr the ep segment explores for develops produces purchases transports and sells crude oil and natural gas the mr segment manufactures purchases transports trades and markets refined petroleum products natural gas and electricity 

 

net income in 2007 was 1832 million compared with 1920 million in 2006 and 1226 million in 2005 diluted earnings per share were 574 in 2007 compared with 608 in 2006 and 393 in 2005 a table of items affecting comparability between periods is shown on page 21 

 

exploration and production 

 

the corporation’s strategy for the ep segment is to profitably grow reserves and production in a sustainable and financially disciplined manner the corporation’s total proved reserves were 1330 million barrels of oil equivalent boe at december 31 2007 compared with 1243 million boe at december 31 2006 and 1093 million boe at december 31 2005 total proved reserves at year end 2007 increased 87 million boe or 7 from the end of 2006 

 

ep net income was 1842 million in 2007 1763 million in 2006 and 1058 million in 2005 the improved results in 2007 as compared to 2006 were primarily driven by higher average crude oil selling prices and increased crude oil and natural gas production see further discussion in comparison of results on page 21 

 

production averaged 377000 barrels of oil equivalent per day boepd in 2007 compared with 359000 boepd in 2006 and 335000 boepd in 2005 production in 2007 increased 18000 boepd or 5 from 2006 reflecting the following developments 

 

  

in 2008 the corporation expects total worldwide production of approximately 380000 boepd to 390000 boepd 

 

during the year the corporation progressed development projects that will add to its production in future years

during 2007 the corporation’s exploration activities included 

 

  

during 2007 the corporation completed the following acquisition and divestiture transactions 

 

  

marketing and refining 

 

the corporation’s strategy for the mr segment is to deliver consistent operating performance and generate free cash flow mr net income was 300 million in 2007 394 million in 2006 and 499 million in 2005 profitability in 2007 and 2006 was adversely affected by lower average margins 

 

refining operations contributed net income of 193 million in 2007 240 million in 2006 and 330 million in 2005 the corporation received cash distributions from hovensa a 50 owned refining joint venture with a subsidiary of petroleos de venezuela sa pdvsa totaling 300 million in 2007 400 million in 2006 and 275 million in 2005 gross crude runs at hovensa averaged 454000 barrels per day in 2007 compared with 448000 barrels per day in 2006 and 461000 barrels per day in 2005 in 2007 hovensa successfully completed the first turnaround of its delayed coking unit the port reading refinery operated at an average of 61000 barrels per day in 2007 versus 63000 barrels per day in 2006 and 55000 barrels per day in 2005 marketing earnings were 83 million in 2007 108 million in 2006 and 136 million in 2005 total refined product sales volumes averaged 451000 barrels per day in 2007 compared with 459000 barrels per day in 2006 and 456000 barrels per day in 2005 

 

liquidity and capital and exploratory expenditures 

 

net cash provided by operating activities was 3507 million in 2007 3491 million in 2006 and 1840 million in 2005 principally reflecting increasing earnings at december 31 2007 cash and cash equivalents totaled 607 million compared with 383 million at december 31 2006 total debt was 

3980 million at december 31 2007 compared with 3772 million at december 31 2006 the corporation’s debt to capitalization ratio at december 31 2007 was 289 compared with 316 at the end of 2006 the corporation has debt maturities of 62 million in 2008 and 143 million in 2009 

 

capital and exploratory expenditures were as follows for the years ended december 31 

 

 

 

the corporation anticipates 44 billion in capital and exploratory expenditures in 2008 of which 43 billion relates to ep operations 

 

consolidated results of operations 

 

the aftertax results by major operating activity are summarized below 

 

 

 

in the discussion that follows the financial effects of certain transactions are disclosed on an aftertax basis management reviews segment earnings on an aftertax basis and uses aftertax amounts in its review of variances in segment earnings management believes that aftertax amounts are a preferable method of explaining variances in earnings since they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only the pretax amount aftertax amounts are determined by applying the income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pretax amounts 

the following items of income expense on an aftertax basis are included in net income 

 

 

 

 

the items in the table above are explained and the pretax amounts are shown on pages 24 through 27 

 

comparison of results 

 

exploration and production 

 

following is a summarized income statement of the corporation’s exploration and production operations 

 

 

 

 

 

 21 

 

after considering the exploration and production items in the table on page 21 the remaining changes in exploration and production earnings are primarily attributable to changes in selling prices production volumes operating costs exploration expenses and income taxes as discussed below 

 

selling prices higher average selling prices primarily crude oil increased exploration and production revenues by approximately 740 million in 2007 compared with 2006 in 2006 the increase in average crude oil selling prices and reduced hedge positions increased revenues by approximately 1900 million compared with 2005 

 

the corporation’s average selling prices were as follows 

 

 

 

 

the aftertax impacts of hedging reduced earnings by 244 million 399 million before income taxes in 2007 285 million 449 million before income taxes in 2006 and 989 million 1582 million before income taxes in 2005 

 

production and sales volumes the corporation’s crude oil and natural gas production was 377000 boepd in 2007 compared with 359000 boepd in 2006 and 335000 boepd in 2005 the corporation anticipates that its 2008 production will average between 380000 and 390000 boepd 

the corporation’s net daily worldwide production was as follows 

 

 

 

 

  

united states crude oil and natural gas production was lower in 2007 compared with 2006 and 2005 principally due to natural decline and asset sales 

 

europe crude oil production in 2007 was lower than in 2006 reflecting natural decline facilities work on three north sea fields and the sale of the corporation’s interests in the scott and telford fields in the united kingdom these decreases were partially offset by increased production in russia decreased natural gas production in 2007 compared with 2006 was principally due to lower nominations related to the shutdown of a nonoperated pipeline in the north sea and natural decline partially offset by higher production from the atlantic and cromarty natural gas fields in the united kingdom which commenced in june 2006 production in europe was comparable in 2006 and 2005 reflecting increased production from russia and new production from the atlantic and cromarty fields which offset lower production due to maintenance and natural decline 

 

africa crude oil production increased in 2007 compared with 2006 primarily due to the startup of the okume complex in equatorial guinea in december 2006 production in 2006 was higher than 2005 levels principally due to production from libya which the corporation reentered in january 2006 

 

asia and other crude oil production increased in 2007 versus 2006 reflecting a combination of an increased entitlement and higher production in azerbaijan higher natural gas production in 2007 compared with 2006 was principally due to new production from the sinphuhorm onshore gas project in thailand which commenced in november 2006 and new production from the ujung pangkah field in indonesia which commenced in april 2007 these increases were partially offset by the planned shutdown of the jda to install facilities required for phase 2 gas sales natural gas production was higher in 2006 compared with 2005 due to increased production from the jda 

 

sales volumes higher sales volumes increased revenue by approximately 240 million in 2007 compared with 2006 and 400 million in 2006 compared with 2005

2007 the gain from asset sales relates to the sale of the corporation’s interests in the scott and telford fields located in the united kingdom north sea the charge for asset impairments relates to two mature fields in the united kingdom north sea the pretax amount of this charge is reflected in depreciation depletion and amortization the estimated production imbalance settlements represent a charge for adjustments to prior meter readings at two offshore fields which are recorded as a reduction of sales and other operating revenues 

 

2006 the gains from asset sales relate to the sale of certain united states oil and gas producing properties located in the permian basin in texas and new mexico and onshore gulf coast the accrued office closing cost relates to vacated leased office space in the united kingdom the related expenses are reflected principally in general and administrative expenses the income tax adjustment represents a onetime adjustment to the corporation’s deferred tax liability resulting from an increase in the supplementary tax on petroleum operations in the united kingdom from 10 to 20 

 

2005 the gains from asset sales represent the disposal of nonproducing properties in the united kingdom and the exchange of a mature north sea asset for an increased interest in the ujung pangkah field in indonesia the corporation recorded incremental production expenses in 2005 principally repair costs and higher insurance 

premiums as a result of hurricane damage in the gulf of mexico the income tax adjustment reflects the effect on deferred income taxes of a reduction in the income tax rate in denmark and a tax settlement in the united kingdom the legal settlement reflects the favorable resolution of contingencies on a prior year asset sale which is recorded in other income in the income statement 

 

the corporation’s future exploration and production earnings may be impacted by external factors such as political risk volatility in the selling prices of crude oil and natural gas reserve and production changes industry cost inflation exploration expenses the effects of weather and changes in foreign exchange and income tax rates

port reading’s aftertax earnings were 75 million in 2007 104 million in 2006 and 88 million in 2005 refined product margins were lower in 2007 compared with 2006 higher refined product sales volumes were offset by lower margins in 2006 compared with 2005 in 2005 the port reading facility was shutdown for 36 days of planned maintenance 

 

the following table summarizes refinery utilization rates 

 

 

 

marketing marketing operations which consist principally of retail gasoline and energy marketing activities generated income of 59 million in 2007 108 million in 2006 and 112 million in 2005 excluding income from liquidations of lifo inventories and the charge related to a customer bankruptcy described on page 26

accounting policies 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

accounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of assets and liabilities on the corporation’s balance sheet and revenues and expenses on the income statement the accounting methods used can affect net income stockholders’ equity and various financial statement ratios however the corporation’s accounting policies generally do not change cash flows or liquidity 

 

accounting for exploration and development costs exploration and production activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage including lease bonuses brokers’ fees and other related costs are capitalized annual lease rentals exploration 

expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred costs of drilling and equipping productive wells including development dry holes and related production facilities are capitalized 

 

the costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if 1 the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and 2 sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project if either of those criteria is not met or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project the capitalized well costs are charged to expense indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves and the economic and operating viability of a project include commitment of project personnel active negotiations for sales contracts with customers negotiations with governments operators and contractors and firm plans for additional drilling and other factors 

 

crude oil and natural gas reserves the determination of estimated proved reserves is a significant element in arriving at the results of operations of exploration and production activities the estimates of proved reserves affect well capitalizations the unit of production depreciation rates of proved properties and wells and equipment as well as impairment testing of oil and gas assets and goodwill 

 

the corporation’s oil and gas reserves are calculated in accordance with sec regulations and interpretations and the requirements of the financial accounting standards board for reserves to be booked as proved they must be commercially producible government and project operator approvals must be obtained and depending on the amount of the project cost senior management or the board of directors must commit to fund the project the corporation’s oil and gas reserve estimation and reporting process involves an annual independent third party reserve determination as well as internal technical appraisals of reserves the corporation maintains its own internal reserve estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work directly with the oil and gas properties the corporation’s technical staff updates reserve estimates throughout the year based on evaluations of new wells performance reviews new technical data and other studies to provide consistency throughout the corporation standard reserve estimation guidelines definitions reporting reviews and approval practices are used the internal reserve estimates are subject to internal technical audits and senior management reviews the estimates 

 

the oil and gas reserve estimates reported in the supplementary oil and gas data in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards fas no 69 disclosures about oil and gas producing activities fas no 69 are determined independently by the consulting firm of degolyer and macnaughton dm and are consistent with internal estimates annually the corporation provides dm with engineering geological and geophysical data actual production histories and other information necessary for the reserve determination the corporation’s and dm’s technical staffs meet to review and discuss the information provided senior management and the board of directors review the final reserve estimates issued by dm 

 

impairment of longlived assets and goodwill as explained below there are significant differences in the way longlived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing the corporation reviews longlived assets including oil and gas fields for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered longlived assets are tested based on identifiable cash flows the field level for oil and gas assets and are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities if the carrying amounts of the longlived assets are not expected to be recovered by undiscounted future net cash flow estimates the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded the amount of impairment is based on the estimated fair value of the assets generally determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows 

 

in the case of oil and gas fields the present value of future net cash flows is based on management’s best estimate of future prices which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices applied to projected production volumes of individual fields and discounted at a rate commensurate with the risks involved the projected production volumes represent reserves including probable reserves expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures the production volumes prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairments will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows since the standardized measure requires the use of actual prices on the last day of the year 

the corporation’s impairment tests of longlived exploration and production producing assets are based on its best estimates of future production volumes including recovery factors selling prices operating and capital costs the timing of future production and other factors which are updated each time an impairment test is performed the corporation could have impairments if the projected production volumes from oil and gas fields decrease crude oil and natural gas selling prices decline significantly for an extended period or future estimated capital and operating costs increase significantly 

 

in accordance with fas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets fas no 142 the corporation’s goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter at a reporting unit level which is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment the reporting unit or units used to evaluate and measure goodwill for impairment are determined primarily from the manner in which the business is managed the corporation’s goodwill is assigned to the exploration and production operating segment and it expects that the benefits of goodwill will be recovered through the operation of that segment 

 

the corporation’s fair value estimate of the exploration and production segment is the sum of 1 the discounted anticipated cash flows of producing assets and known developments 2 the estimated risk adjusted present value of exploration assets and 3 an estimated market premium to reflect the market price an acquirer would pay for potential synergies including cost savings access to new business opportunities enterprise control improved processes and increased market share the corporation also considers the relative market valuation of similar exploration and production companies 

 

the determination of the fair value of the exploration and production operating segment depends on estimates about oil and gas reserves future prices timing of future net cash flows and market premiums significant extended declines in crude oil and natural gas prices or reduced reserve estimates could lead to a decrease in the fair value of the exploration and production operating segment that could result in an impairment of goodwill 

 

because there are significant differences in the way longlived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing there may be impairments of individual assets that would not cause an impairment of the goodwill assigned to the exploration and production segment 

 

asset retirement obligations the corporation has material legal obligations to remove and dismantle long lived assets and to restore land or seabed at certain exploration and production locations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles the corporation recognizes a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations in addition the fair value of any legally required conditional asset retirement obligations is recorded if the liability can be reasonably estimated the corporation capitalizes such costs as a component of the carrying amount of the underlying assets in the period in which the liability is incurred in order to measure these obligations the corporation estimates the fair value of the obligations by discounting the future payments that will be required to satisfy the obligations in determining these estimates the corporation is required to make several assumptions and judgments related to the scope of dismantlement timing of settlement interpretation of legal requirements inflationary factors and discount rate in addition there are other external factors which could significantly affect the ultimate settlement costs for these obligations including changes in environmental regulations and other statutory requirements fluctuations in industry costs and foreign currency exchange rates and advances in technology as a result the corporation’s estimates of asset retirement obligations are subject to revision due to the factors described above changes in estimates prior to settlement result in adjustments to both the liability and related asset values 

 

derivatives the corporation utilizes derivative instruments for both nontrading and trading activities in nontrading activities the corporation uses futures forwards options and swaps individually or in combination to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in the prices of crude oil natural gas refined products and electricity and changes in foreign currency exchange rates in trading activities the corporation principally through a consolidated partnership trades energy commodities and derivatives including futures forwards options and swaps based on expectations of future market conditions 

 

all derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in the corporation’s balance sheet the corporation’s policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative the changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges under fas no 133 are recognized currently in 

earnings derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions cash flow hedges or hedges of firm commitments fair value hedges the effective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income loss amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings the ineffective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recorded currently in earnings changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings the change in fair value of the related hedged commitment is recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized currently in earnings 

 

derivatives that are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges are tested for effectiveness prospectively before they are executed and both prospectively and retrospectively on an ongoing basis to determine whether they continue to qualify for hedge accounting the prospective and retrospective effectiveness calculations are performed using either historical simulation or other statistical models which utilize historical observable market data consisting of futures curves and spot prices 

 

income taxes judgments are required in the determination and recognition of income tax assets and liabilities in the financial statements these judgements include the requirement to only recognize the financial statement effect of a tax position when management believes that it is more likely than not that based on the technical merits the position will be sustained upon examination 

 

the corporation has net operating loss carryforwards in several jurisdictions including the united states and has recorded deferred tax assets for those losses additionally the corporation has deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized in evaluating realizability of deferred tax assets the corporation refers to the reversal periods for temporary differences available carryforward periods for net operating losses estimates of future taxable income the availability of tax planning strategies the existence of appreciated assets and other factors estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas reserves and selling prices that are consistent with the corporation’s internal business forecasts the corporation does not provide for deferred us income taxes applicable to undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations 

 

changes in accounting policies 

 

effective january 1 2007 the corporation adopted financial accounting standards board fasb staff position fsp aug air1 accounting for planned major maintenance activities this fsp eliminated the previously acceptable accrueinadvance method of accounting for planned major maintenance as a result the corporation retrospectively changed its method of accounting to recognize expenses associated with refinery turnarounds when such costs are incurred the impact of adopting this fsp increased previously reported 2006 earnings by 4 million 01 per diluted share in addition previously reported 2005 net income decreased by 16 million 05 per diluted share and retained earnings as of january 1 2005 increased by approximately 48 million all 2007 2006 and 2005 financial information reflects this retrospective accounting change 

 

effective january 1 2007 the corporation adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 48 fin 48 prescribes the financial statement recognition and measurement criteria for a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return fin 48 also requires additional disclosures related to uncertain income tax positions see note 11 “income taxes” for further information 

 

recently issued accounting standard 

 

in september 2006 the fasb issued fas no 157 fair value measurements fas no 157 fas no 157 establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires disclosure of a fair value hierarchy which applies to financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value under other authoritative accounting pronouncements the standard also requires additional disclosure about the methods of determining fair value the corporation as 

required will prospectively adopt the provisions of fas no 157 effective january 1 2008 the corporation believes that the impact of adopting fas no 157 on net income will not be material in addition the corporation expects to record a reduction in the aftertax charge reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income relating to the crude oil hedging program of approximately 160 million after income taxes

the corporation has implemented a valuesbased sociallyresponsible strategy focused on improving environment health and safety performance and making a positive impact on communities the strategy is supported by the corporation’s environment health safety and social responsibility ehs  sr policies and by environment and safety management systems that help protect the corporation’s workforce customers and local communities the corporation’s management systems are designed to uphold or exceed international standards and are intended to promote internal consistency adherence to policy objectives and continual improvement in ehs  sr performance improved performance may in the shortterm increase the corporation’s operating costs and could also require increased capital expenditures to reduce potential risks to assets reputation and license to operate in addition to enhanced ehs  sr performance improved productivity and operational efficiencies may be realized as collateral benefits from investments in ehs  sr the corporation has programs in place to evaluate regulatory compliance audit facilities train employees prevent and manage risks and emergencies and to generally meet corporate ehs  sr goals 

 

the production of motor and other fuels in the united states and elsewhere has faced increasing regulatory pressures in recent years in 2006 additional regulations to reduce the allowable sulfur content in diesel fuel went into effect additional reductions in gasoline and fuel oil sulfur content are under consideration fuels production will likely continue to be subject to more stringent regulation in future years and as such may require additional capital expenditures the energy policy act of 2005 imposes on refiners a requirement to use specific quantities of renewable content in gasoline the 2007 energy policy act expanded requirements on the use of renewable content and included several technology forcing provisions many states have also enacted or are considering biofuels mandates which in combination with national legislation may affect the registrant’s markets for fuels 

 

as described in item 3 “legal proceedings” in 2003 the corporation and hovensa began discussions with the us epa regarding the epa’s petroleum refining initiative pri the pri is an ongoing program that is designed to reduce certain air emissions at all us refineries since 2000 the epa has entered into settlements addressing these emissions with petroleum refining companies that control over 80 of the domestic refining capacity negotiations with the epa are continuing and depending on the outcome of these discussions the corporation and hovensa may experience increased capital expenditures and operating expenses related to air emissions controls settlements with other refiners allow for controls to be phased in over several years 

 

the corporation has undertaken a program to assess monitor and reduce the emission of “greenhouse gases” including carbon dioxide and methane the challenges associated with this program are significant not only from the standpoint of technical feasibility but also from the perspective of adequately measuring the corporation’s greenhouse gas inventory the corporation has completed a revised monitoring protocol which will allow for better measurement of “greenhouse gases” and has completed an independently verified audit of its emissions the monitoring protocol in conjunction with the corporation’s recently formulated climate change network will allow for better control of these emissions and assist the corporation in developing policies and programs to reduce these emissions and comply with any future regulatory restrictions 

 

the corporation expects continuing expenditures for environmental assessment and remediation related primarily to existing conditions sites where corrective action may be necessary include gasoline stations terminals onshore exploration and production facilities refineries including solid waste management units under permits issued pursuant to the resource conservation and recovery act and although not currently significant “superfund” sites where the corporation has been named a potentially responsible party 

 

the corporation accrues for environmental assessment and remediation expenses when the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable at yearend 2007 the corporation’s reserve for estimated environmental liabilities was approximately 60 million the corporation expects that existing reserves for environmental liabilities will adequately cover costs to assess and remediate known sites the corporation’s remediation spending 

was 23 million in 2007 and 15 million in 2006 and 2005 capital expenditures incurred over several years to comply with low sulfur gasoline and diesel fuel requirements totaled approximately 400 million at hovensa and approximately 70 million at port reading capital expenditures for facilities primarily to comply with federal state and local environmental standards other than for the low sulfur requirements were 22 million in 2007 and 2006 and 3 million in 2005

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

in the normal course of its business the corporation is exposed to commodity risks related to changes in the price of crude oil natural gas refined products and electricity as well as to changes in interest rates and foreign currency values in the disclosures that follow these operations are referred to as nontrading activities the corporation also has trading operations principally through a 50 voting interest in a trading partnership these activities are also exposed to commodity risks primarily related to the prices of crude oil natural gas and refined products the following describes how these risks are controlled and managed 

 

controls the corporation maintains a control environment under the direction of its chief risk officer and through its corporate risk policy which the corporation’s senior management has approved controls include volumetric term and valueatrisk limits in addition the chief risk officer must approve the use of new instruments or commodities risk limits are monitored daily and exceptions are reported to business units and to senior management the corporation’s risk management department also performs independent verifications of sources of fair values and validations of valuation models these controls apply to all of the corporation’s nontrading and trading activities including the consolidated trading partnership the corporation’s treasury department is responsible for administering foreign exchange rate and interest rate hedging programs 

 

instruments the corporation primarily uses forward commodity contracts foreign exchange forward contracts futures swaps options and energy commodity based securities in its nontrading and trading activities these contracts are generally widely traded instruments with standardized terms the following describes these instruments and how the corporation uses them 

 

 36 

 

  

valueatrisk the corporation uses valueatrisk to monitor and control commodity risk within its trading and nontrading activities the valueatrisk model uses historical simulation and the results represent the potential loss in fair value over one day at a 95 confidence level the model captures both first and second order sensitivities for options the following table summarizes the valueatrisk results for trading and nontrading activities these results may vary from time to time as strategies change in trading activities or hedging levels change in nontrading activities 

 

 

 

nontrading the corporation’s nontrading activities may include hedging of crude oil and natural gas production futures and swaps are used to fix the selling prices of a portion of the corporation’s future production and the related gains or losses are an integral part of the corporation’s selling prices following is a summary of the corporation’s outstanding crude oil hedges at december 31 2007 

 

 

 

there were no hedges of wti crude oil or natural gas production at december 31 2007 as market conditions change the corporation may adjust its hedge percentages the corporation also markets energy commodities including refined petroleum products natural gas and electricity the corporation uses futures swaps and options to manage the risk in its marketing activities 

 

accumulated other comprehensive income loss at december 31 2007 includes aftertax unrealized deferred losses of 1672 million primarily related to crude oil contracts used as hedges of exploration and production sales the pretax amount of deferred hedge losses is reflected in accounts payable and the related income tax benefits are recorded as deferred tax assets on the balance sheet 

the corporation uses foreign exchange contracts to reduce its exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates by entering into forward purchase contracts for both the british pound sterling and the danish kroner at december 31 2007 the corporation had 977 million of notional value foreign exchange contracts maturing in 2008 the fair value of the foreign exchange contracts was a payable of 1 million at december 31 2007 the change in fair value of the foreign exchange contracts from a 10 change in exchange rates is estimated to be approximately 100 million at december 31 2007 

 

the corporation’s outstanding debt of 3980 million has a fair value of 4263 million at december 31 2007 a 15 decrease in the rate of interest would increase the fair value of debt by approximately 200 million at december 31 2007 

 

trading in trading activities the corporation is exposed to changes in crude oil natural gas and refined product prices the trading partnership in which the corporation has a 50 voting interest trades energy commodities securities and derivatives the accounts of the partnership are consolidated with those of the corporation the corporation also takes trading positions for its own account the information that follows represents 100 of the trading partnership and the corporation’s proprietary trading accounts 

 

gains or losses from sales of physical products are recorded at the time of sale total realized gains on trading activities for 2007 amounted to 303 million 721 million in 2006 derivative trading transactions are markedtomarket and unrealized gains or losses are reflected in income currently the following table provides an assessment of the factors affecting the changes in fair value of trading activities and represents 100 of the trading partnership and other trading activities 

 

 

 

the corporation uses observable market values for determining the fair value of its trading instruments in cases where actively quoted prices are not available other external sources are used which incorporate information about commodity prices in actively quoted markets quoted prices in less active markets and other market fundamental analysis internal estimates are based on internal models incorporating underlying market information such as commodity volatilities and correlations the corporation’s risk management department regularly compares valuations to independent sources and models

 item 1a   risk factors related to our business and operations tableend  

our business activities and the value of our securities are subject to significant risk factors including those described below the risk factors described below could negatively affect our operations financial condition liquidity and results of operations and as a result holders and purchasers of our securities could lose part or all of their investments it is possible additional risks relating to our securities may be described in a prospectus supplement if we issue securities in the future 

 

commodity price risk our estimated proved reserves revenue operating cash flows operating margins future earnings and trading operations are highly dependent on the prices of crude oil natural gas and refined petroleum products which are influenced by numerous factors beyond our control historically these prices have been very volatile the major foreign oil producing countries including members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec exert considerable influence over the supply and price of crude oil and refined petroleum products their ability or inability to agree on a common policy on rates of production and other matters has a significant impact on the oil markets the derivatives markets may also influence the selling prices of crude oil natural gas and refined petroleum products a significant downward trend in commodity prices would have a material adverse effect on our revenues profitability and cash flow and could result in a reduction in the carrying value of our oil and gas assets goodwill and proved oil and gas reserves to the extent that we engage in hedging activities to mitigate commodity price volatility we will not realize the benefit of price increases above the hedged price 

 

technical risk we own or have access to a finite amount of oil and gas reserves which will be depleted over time replacement of oil and gas reserves is subject to successful exploration drilling development activities and enhanced recovery programs therefore future oil and gas production is dependent on technical success in finding 

and developing additional hydrocarbon reserves exploration activity involves the interpretation of seismic and other geological and geophysical data which does not always successfully predict the presence of commercial quantities of hydrocarbons drilling risks include adverse unexpected conditions irregularities in pressure or formations equipment failure blowouts and weather interruptions future developments may be affected by unforeseen reservoir conditions which negatively affect recovery factors or flow rates the costs of drilling and development activities have also been increasing which could negatively affect expected economic returns although due diligence is used in evaluating acquired oil and gas properties similar uncertainties may be encountered in the production of oil and gas on properties acquired from others 

 

oil and gas reserves and discounted future net cash flow risks numerous uncertainties exist in estimating quantities of proved reserves and future net revenues from those reserves actual future production oil and gas prices revenues taxes capital expenditures operating expenses geologic success and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates and could materially affect the estimated quantities and future net revenues of our proved reserves in addition reserve estimates may be subject to downward or upward revisions based on production performance purchases or sales of properties results of future development prevailing oil and gas prices production sharing contracts which may decrease reserves as crude oil and natural gas prices increase and other factors 

 

political risk federal state local territorial and foreign laws and regulations relating to tax increases and retroactive tax claims expropriation of property cancellation of contract rights and changes in import regulations as well as other political developments may affect our operations for example during 2006 the governments of the united kingdom and algeria increased taxation on our crude oil and natural gas revenues in response to higher crude oil and natural gas prices some of the international areas in which we operate may be politically less stable than our domestic operations in addition the increasing threat of terrorism around the world poses additional risks to the operations of the oil and gas industry in our mr segment we market motor fuels through lesseedealers and wholesalers in certain states where legislation prohibits producers or refiners of crude oil from directly engaging in retail marketing of motor fuels similar legislation has been periodically proposed in the us congress and in various other states 

 

environmental risk our oil and gas operations like those of the industry are subject to environmental hazards such as oil spills produced water spills gas leaks and ruptures and discharges of substances or gases that could expose us to substantial liability for pollution or other environmental damage our operations are also subject to numerous united states federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations noncompliance with these laws and regulations may subject us to administrative civil or criminal penalties remedial cleanups and natural resource damages or other liabilities in addition increasingly stringent environmental regulations particularly relating to the production of motor and other fuels has resulted and will likely continue to result in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us and the oil and gas industry generally 

 

competitive risk the petroleum industry is highly competitive and very capital intensive we encounter competition from numerous companies in each of our activities particularly in acquiring rights to explore for crude oil and natural gas and in the purchasing and marketing of refined products and natural gas many competitors including national oil companies are larger and have substantially greater resources we are also in competition with producers and marketers of other forms of energy increased competition for worldwide oil and gas assets has significantly increased the cost of acquisitions in addition competition for drilling services and equipment has affected the availability of drilling rigs and increased capital and operating costs 

 

catastrophic risk although we maintain an appropriate level of insurance coverage against property and casualty losses our oil and gas operations are subject to unforeseen occurrences which may damage or destroy assets or interrupt operations examples of catastrophic risks include hurricanes fires explosions and blowouts these occurrences have affected us from time to time during 2005 our annual gulf of mexico production of crude oil and natural gas was reduced by 7000 barrels of oil equivalent per day boepd due to the impact of hurricanes katrina and rita

 item 3   legal proceedings tableend  

purported class actions consolidated under a complaint captioned in re amerada hess securities litigation were filed in united states district court for the district of new jersey against the registrant and certain executive officers and former executive officers of the registrant alleging that these individuals sold shares of the registrant’s common stock in advance of the registrant’s acquisition of triton energy limited triton in 2001 in violation of federal securities laws in april 2003 the registrant and the other defendants filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim and failure to plead fraud with particularity on march 31 2004 the court granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint the plaintiffs were granted leave to file an amended complaint plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in june 2004 defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint in june 2005 this motion was denied on january 30 2007 the district court issued an order preliminarily approving settlement of this action and providing for notice to members of the class of plaintiffs while continuing to deny the allegations of the complaint and all charges of wrongdoing or liability arising in connection with the subject matter of the action the defendants agreed with plaintiffs to settle the action on the terms set forth in the stipulation of settlement in order to avoid the cost inconvenience and uncertainty of continued protracted litigation under the terms of the settlement defendants have caused to be deposited into an escrow account the sum of 9 million which after payment of certain administrative expenses and plaintiffs’ attorney fees will be distributed according to a plan of allocation to class members who submit valid and timely proof of claim and release forms all of the amount deposited was paid by the defendants’ insurer the settlement is subject to final approval of the district court and certain other conditions including that not more than 5 of shares owned by class members eligible to participate in the settlement elect to opt out of the settlement 

 

the registrant along with many other companies engaged in refining and marketing of gasoline has been a party to lawsuits and claims related to the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe in gasoline a series of substantially identical lawsuits many involving water utilities or governmental entities were filed in jurisdictions across the united states against producers of mtbe and petroleum refiners who produce gasoline containing mtbe including the registrant these cases have been consolidated in the southern district of new york and the registrant is named as a defendant in 43 of the 69 cases pending the principal allegation in all cases is that gasoline containing mtbe is a defective product and that these parties are strictly liable in proportion to their share of the gasoline market for damage to groundwater resources and are required to take remedial action to ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of releases of mtbe in some cases punitive damages are also sought in april 2005 the district court denied the primary legal aspects of the defendants’ motion to dismiss these actions while the damages claimed in these actions are substantial only limited information is available to evaluate the factual and legal merits of those claims the corporation also believes that significant legal uncertainty remains regarding the validity of causes of action asserted and availability of the relief sought by plaintiffs accordingly based on the information currently available there is insufficient information on which to evaluate the corporation’s exposure in these cases 

 

over the last several years many refiners have entered into consent agreements to resolve the epa’s assertions that refining facilities were modified or expanded without complying with new source review regulations that require permits and new emission controls in certain circumstances and other regulations that impose emissions control requirements these consent agreements which arise out of an epa enforcement initiative focusing on petroleum refiners and utilities have typically imposed substantial civil fines and penalties and required i significant capital expenditures to install emissions control equipment over a three to eight year time period and ii changes to operations which resulted in increased operating costs settlements under petroleum refining initiative consent agreements to date have averaged 335 per barrel per day of refining capacity however the capital expenditures penalties and supplemental environmental projects for individual refineries covered by the settlements can vary significantly depending on the size and configuration of the refinery the circumstances of the alleged modifications and whether the refinery has previously installed more advanced pollution controls epa initially contacted registrant and hovensa llc hovensa its 50 owned joint venture with petroleos de venezuela regarding the petroleum refinery initiative in august 2003 and discussions resumed in august 2005 the registrant and hovensa have had and expect to have further discussions with the epa regarding the petroleum refining initiative although both the registrant and hovensa have already installed many of the pollution controls required of other refiners under the consent agreements and the epa has not made any specific 

assertions that either registrant or hovensa violated either new source review or other regulations which would require additional controls while the effect on the corporation of the petroleum refining initiative cannot be estimated at this time additional future capital expenditures and operating expenses may be incurred the amount of penalties if any is not expected to be material to the corporation 

 

in december 2006 hovensa received a notice of violation nov from the epa alleging noncompliance with emissions limits in a permit issued by the virgin islands department of planning and natural resources dpnr for the two process heaters in the delayed coking unit the nov was issued in response to a voluntary investigation and submission by hovensa regarding potential noncompliance with the permit emissions limits for two pollutants any exceedances were minor from the perspective of the amount of pollutants emitted in excess of the limits hovensa intends to work with the appropriate governmental agency to reach resolution of this matter and does not believe that it will result in material liability 

 

registrant is one of over 60 companies that have received a directive from the new jersey department of environmental protection njdep to remediate contamination in the sediments of the lower passaic river and njdep is also seeking natural resource damages the directive insofar as it affects registrant relates to alleged releases from a petroleum bulk storage terminal in newark new jersey now owned by the registrant epa has also issued an administrative order on consent relating to the same contamination while njdep has suggested a remedial cost of over 900 million the costs of remediation of the passaic river sediments are the subject of a remedial investigation and feasibility study currently being conducted on a portion of the river by the epa under an agreement with registrant and over 40 other companies thus remedial costs cannot be reliably estimated at this time based on currently known facts and circumstances the registrant does not believe that this matter will result in material liability because its terminal could not have contributed contamination along most of the river’s length and did not store or use contaminants which are of the greatest concern in the river sediments and because there are numerous other parties who will likely share in the cost of remediation and damages 

 

on or about july 15 2004 hess oil virgin islands corp hovic a wholly owned subsidiary of the registrant and hovensa in which registrant owns a 50 interest each received a letter from the commissioner of the virgin islands department of planning and natural resources and natural resources trustees advising of the trustee’s intention to bring suit against hovic and hovensa under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla the letter alleges that hovic and hovensa are potentially responsible for damages to natural resources arising from releases of hazardous substances from the “hovensa oil refinery” hovensa currently owns and operates a petroleum refinery on the south shore of st croix united states virgin islands which had been operated by hovic until october 1998 an action was filed on may 5 2005 in the district court of the virgin islands against hovensa hovic and other companies that operated industrial facilities on the south shore of st croix asserting that the defendants are liable under cercla and territorial statutory and common law for damages to natural resources hovic and hovensa do not believe that this matter will result in a material liability as they believe that they have strong defenses to this complaint and they intend to vigorously defend this matter 

 

the securities and exchange commission sec has notified the registrant that on july 21 2005 it commenced a private investigation into payments made to the government of equatorial guinea or to officials and persons affiliated with officials of the government of equatorial guinea the staff of the sec has requested documents and information from the registrant and other oil and gas companies that have operations or interests in equatorial guinea the staff of the sec had previously been conducting an informal inquiry into such matters the registrant has been cooperating and continues to cooperate with the sec investigation 

 

registrant has been served with a complaint from the new york state department of environmental conservation dec relating to alleged violations at its petroleum terminal in brooklyn new york the complaint which seeks an order to shut down the terminal and penalties in unspecified amounts alleges violations involving the structural integrity of certain tanks the erosion of shorelines and bulkheads petroleum discharges and improper certification of tank repairs dec is also seeking relief relating to remediation of certain gasoline stations in the new york metropolitan area registrant believes that many of the allegations are factually inaccurate or based on an incorrect interpretation of applicable law registrant has already addressed the primary conditions discussed in the 

complaint registrant intends to vigorously contest the complaint but is involved in settlement discussions with dec any settlement is not expected to be material to the corporation 

 

the registrant periodically receives notices from epa that it is a “potential responsible party” under the superfund legislation with respect to various waste disposal sites under this legislation all potentially responsible parties are jointly and severally liable for certain sites epa’s claims or assertions of liability against the corporation relating to these sites have not been fully developed with respect to the remaining sites epa’s claims have been settled or a proposed settlement is under consideration in all cases for amounts that are not material the ultimate impact of these proceedings and of any related proceedings by private parties on the business or accounts of the corporation cannot be predicted at this time due to the large number of other potentially responsible parties and the speculative nature of cleanup cost estimates but is not expected to be material 

 

the corporation is from time to time involved in other judicial and administrative proceedings including proceedings relating to other environmental matters although the ultimate outcome of these proceedings cannot be ascertained at this time and some of them may be resolved adversely to the corporation no such proceeding is required to be disclosed under applicable rules of the securities and exchange commission in management’s opinion based upon currently known facts and circumstances such proceedings in the aggregate will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the corporation

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend  

overview 

 

the corporation is a global integrated energy company that operates in two segments exploration and production ep and marketing and refining mr the ep segment explores for develops produces purchases transports and sells crude oil and natural gas the mr segment manufactures purchases transports trades and markets refined petroleum products natural gas and electricity 

 

net income in 2006 was 1916 million compared with 1242 million in 2005 and 977 million in 2004 diluted earnings per share were 607 in 2006 compared with 398 in 2005 and 319 in 2004 

 

exploration and production 

 

the corporation’s strategy for the ep segment is to profitably grow reserves and production in a sustainable and financially disciplined manner at december 31 2006 and 2005 the corporation’s total proved reserves were 1243 million and 1093 million barrels of oil equivalent the following table summarizes the components of proved reserves as of december 31 

 

 

 

 

ep net income was 1763 million in 2006 1058 million in 2005 and 762 million in 2004 the improved results were primarily driven by higher average crude oil selling prices during the reporting period and lower hedged crude oil volumes in 2006 see further discussion in comparison of results on page 24 

 

production totaled 359000 barrels of oil equivalent per day boepd in 2006 335000 boepd in 2005 and 342000 boepd in 2004 the corporation estimates that production will be approximately 370000 boepd to 380000 boepd in 2007 

 

during 2006 the corporation commenced production from four new field developments 

 

  

the corporation has several additional development projects that will also increase production in the future 

 

 20 

 

  

during 2006 the corporation’s exploration program had several successes particularly in the deepwater gulf of mexico 

 

  

in addition during 2006 the corporation made the following acquisitions and also disposed of several producing properties 

 

  

marketing and refining 

 

the corporation’s strategy for the mr segment is to deliver consistent financial performance and generate free cash flow mr net income was 390 million in 2006 515 million in 2005 and 451 million in 2004 total marketing and refining earnings decreased in 2006 due to lower margins on refined product sales refining 

operations contributed net income of 236 million in 2006 346 million in 2005 and 302 million in 2004 profitability in 2006 was adversely affected by lower refined product margins refining facilities at the hovensa joint venture and at port reading performed reliably in 2006 with the exception of 22 days of unplanned downtime at hovensa early in the year the corporation received cash distributions from hovensa totaling 400 million in 2006 and 275 million in 2005 

 

in 2006 the corporation’s port reading facility completed its 72 million program for complying with lowsulfur gasoline requirements capital expenditures to comply with lowsulfur gasoline and diesel fuel requirements at hovensa are estimated to be approximately 420 million of which 360 million has been incurred through the end of 2006 with the remainder to be spent in 2007 

 

marketing earnings were 108 million in 2006 136 million in 2005 and 112 million in 2004 during 2006 and 2005 the corporation selectively expanded its energy marketing business by acquiring natural gas and electricity customer accounts 

 

liquidity and capital and exploratory expenditures 

 

net cash provided by operating activities was 3491 million in 2006 compared with 1840 million in 2005 at december 31 2006 cash and cash equivalents totaled 383 million compared with 315 million at december 31 2005 total debt was 3772 million at december 31 2006 compared with 3785 million at december 31 2005 the corporation’s debt to capitalization ratio at december 31 2006 was 317 compared with 376 at the end of 2005 the corporation has debt maturities of 27 million in 2007 and 28 million in 2008 

 

capital and exploratory expenditures were as follows for the years ended december 31 

 

 

 

 

the corporation anticipates 40 billion in capital and exploratory expenditures in 2007 of which 39 billion relates to ep operations these expenditures include 371 million for the acquisition of a 28 interest in the genghis khan development in the deepwater gulf of mexico 

 

consolidated results of operations 

 

the aftertax results by major operating activity are summarized below 

 

 

 

 

  

in the discussion that follows the financial effects of certain transactions are disclosed on an aftertax basis management reviews segment earnings on an aftertax basis and uses aftertax amounts in its review of variances in segment earnings management believes that aftertax amounts are a preferable method of explaining variances in earnings since they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only the pretax amount aftertax amounts are determined by applying the appropriate income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pretax amounts 

 

the following items of income expense on an aftertax basis are included in net income 

 

 

 

the items in the table above are explained and the pretax amounts are shown on pages 26 through 29 

 

comparison of results 

 

exploration and production 

 

following is a summarized income statement of the corporation’s exploration and production operations 

 

 

 

after considering the exploration and production items in the table on page 23 the remaining changes in exploration and production earnings are primarily attributable to changes in selling prices production volumes operating costs exploration expenses and income taxes as discussed below 

 

selling prices higher average crude oil selling prices and reduced hedge positions increased exploration and production revenues by approximately 1900 million in 2006 compared with 2005 in 2005 the change in average selling prices increased revenues by approximately 870 million compared with 2004 

 

the corporation’s average selling prices were as follows 

 

 24 

 

 

the aftertax impacts of hedging reduced earnings by 285 million 449 million before income taxes in 2006 989 million 1582 million before income taxes in 2005 and 583 million 935 million before income taxes in 2004 

 

production and sales volumes the corporation’s crude oil and natural gas production was 359000 boepd in 2006 335000 boepd in 2005 and 342000 boepd in 2004 the corporation anticipates that its 2007 production will average between 370000 and 380000 boepd the corporation’s net daily worldwide production was as follows 

 

 

 

 

  

crude oil and natural gas production in the united states was lower in 2006 due to asset sales and natural decline production in europe was comparable in 2006 and 2005 reflecting increased production from russia and new production from the atlantic and cromarty natural gas fields in the united kingdom which offset lower production due to maintenance and natural decline increased crude oil production in africa in 2006 was primarily due to production from libya natural gas production in asia was higher in 2006 due to increased production from the jda 

 

higher sales volumes increased revenue by approximately 400 million in 2006 compared with 2005 decreased sales volumes resulted in lower revenue of approximately 80 million in 2005 compared with 2004 

 

operating costs and depreciation depletion and amortization cash operating costs consisting of production expenses and general and administrative expenses increased by 322 million in 2006 and 147 million in 2005 compared with the corresponding amounts in prior years excluding the charges for vacated leased office space and hurricane related costs discussed below production expenses increased in 2006 and 2005 principally reflecting higher maintenance expenses increased costs of services materials and fuel and higher production taxes resulting from higher oil prices production expenses also increased in 2006 due to the reentry into libya and continued expansion of operations in russia and the jda depreciation depletion and amortization charges were higher in 2006 principally reflecting increased production volumes and higher per barrel rates due to new production from the atlantic and cromarty fields and higher asset retirement obligations depreciation depletion and amortization charges were higher in 2005 versus 2004 principally due to higher per barrel rates 

 

cash operating costs per barrel of oil equivalent were 1092 in 2006 907 in 2005 and 767 in 2004 cash operating costs for 2007 are estimated to be in the range of 1200 to 1300 per barrel reflecting industrywide cost increases and the timing of achieving peak production from new fields depreciation depletion and amortization costs per barrel of oil equivalent were 885 in 2006 788 in 2005 and 734 in 2004 depreciation depletion and related costs for 2007 are expected to be in the range of 1000 to 1100 per barrel the anticipated increase is due to new fields including the okume complex which has allocated acquisition cost in its depreciable base 

 

exploration expenses exploration expenses were higher in 2006 primarily reflecting higher dry hole costs exploration expenses were higher in 2005 compared with 2004 as a result of increased drilling and seismic activity 

 

income taxes the effective income tax rate for exploration and production operations was 53 in 2006 41 in 2005 and 43 in 2004 after considering the items in the table below the effective income tax rates were 54 in 2006 42 in 2005 and 46 in 2004 the increase in the 2006 effective income tax rate was primarily due to taxes on libyan operations and the increase in the supplementary tax on petroleum operations in the united kingdom from 10 to 20 during 2006 the algerian government amended its hydrocarbon tax laws effective august 1 2006 and the corporation recorded a net charge of 6 million for the estimated impact of the tax the effective income tax rate for ep operations in 2007 is expected to be in the range of 52 to 56 

 

other aftertax foreign currency gains were 10 million 21 million before income taxes in 2006 20 million 3 million loss before income taxes in 2005 and 6 million 29 million before income taxes in 2004 

 

reported exploration and production earnings include the following items of income expense before and after income taxes 

 

 

 

2006 the gains from asset sales relate to the sale of certain united states oil and gas producing properties located in the permian basin in texas and new mexico and onshore gulf coast the accrued office closing cost relates to vacated leased office space in the united kingdom the income tax adjustment represents a onetime adjustment to the corporation’s deferred tax liability resulting from an increase in the supplementary tax on petroleum operations in the united kingdom from 10 to 20 

 

2005 the gains from asset sales represent the disposal of nonproducing properties in the united kingdom and the exchange of a mature north sea asset for an increased interest in the pangkah development in indonesia the corporation incurred incremental expenses in 2005 principally repair costs and higher insurance premiums as a result of hurricane damage in the gulf of mexico that are included in production expenses in the income statement the income tax adjustment reflects the effect on deferred income taxes of a reduction in the income tax rate in denmark and a tax settlement in the united kingdom the legal settlement reflects the favorable resolution of contingencies on a prior year asset sale which is reflected in nonoperating income in the income statement 

 

2004 the corporation recognized gains from the sales of an office building in scotland a nonproducing property in malaysia and two mature gulf of mexico properties it also recorded foreign income tax benefits resulting from a change in tax law and a tax settlement the corporation recorded an aftertax charge for vacated leased office space in the united kingdom and severance costs which is reflected in general and administrative expenses in the income statement 

 

the corporation’s future exploration and production earnings may be impacted by external factors such as political risk volatility in the selling prices of crude oil and natural gas reserve and production changes industry cost inflation exploration expenses the effects of weather and changes in foreign exchange and income tax rates 

 

marketing and refining 

 

earnings from marketing and refining activities amounted to 390 million in 2006 515 million in 2005 and 451 million in 2004 after considering the marketing and refining items in the table on page 23 the earnings amounted to 390 million in 2006 491 million in 2005 and 439 million in 2004 and are discussed in the paragraphs below the corporation’s downstream operations include hovensa a 50 owned refining joint venture with a subsidiary of petroleos de venezuela sa pdvsa that is accounted for using the equity method additional marketing and refining activities include a fluid catalytic cracking facility in port reading new jersey as well as retail gasoline stations energy marketing and trading operations 

 

refining refining earnings which consist of the corporation’s share of hovensa’s results port reading earnings interest income on a note receivable from pdvsa and other miscellaneous items were 236 million in 2006 346 million in 2005 and 302 million in 2004 

 

the corporation’s share of hovensa’s net income was 125 million 203 million before income taxes in 2006 and 231 million 376 million before income taxes in 2005 and 216 million 244 million before income taxes in 2004 the lower earnings in 2006 were principally due to lower refined product margins refined product margins were higher in 2005 compared with 2004 in 2006 and 2005 the corporation provided income taxes at the virgin islands statutory rate of 385 on hovensa’s income and the interest income on the note receivable from pdvsa in 2004 income taxes on hovensa’s earnings were partially offset by available loss carryforwards in 2006 the fluid catalytic cracking unit was shutdown for approximately 22 days of unscheduled maintenance during 2005 a crude unit and the fluid catalytic cracking unit at hovensa were each shutdown for approximately 30 days of scheduled maintenance cash distributions from hovensa were 400 million in 2006 275 million in 2005 and 88 million in 2004

port reading’s aftertax earnings were 99 million in 2006 100 million in 2005 and 60 million in 2004 higher refined product sales volumes were offset by lower margins in 2006 compared with 2005 refined product margins were higher in 2005 compared with 2004 in 2005 the port reading facility was shutdown for 36 days of planned maintenance 

 

the following table summarizes refinery utilization rates 

 

 

 

marketing marketing operations which consist principally of retail gasoline and energy marketing activities generated income of 108 million in 2006 112 million in 2005 and 100 million in 2004 excluding the income from liquidation of lifo inventories and the charge related to a customer bankruptcy described below the decrease in 2006 primarily reflects lower margins on refined product sales the increase in 2005 was primarily due to higher margins and increased sales volumes compared with 2004 total refined product sales volumes were 459000 barrels per day in 2006 456000 barrels per day in 2005 and 428000 barrels per day in 2004 

 

the corporation has a 50 voting interest in a consolidated partnership that trades energy commodities and energy derivatives the corporation also takes trading positions for its own account the corporation’s aftertax results from trading activities including its share of the earnings of the trading partnership amounted to income of 46 million in 2006 33 million in 2005 and 37 million in 2004 before income taxes the trading income amounted to 83 million in 2006 60 million in 2005 and 72 million in 2004 and is included in operating revenues in the income statement

the corporation’s future marketing and refining earnings may be impacted by volatility in marketing and refining margins competitive industry conditions government regulatory changes credit risk and supply and demand factors including the effects of weather 

 

corporate 

 

the following table summarizes corporate expenses 

 

 

 

excluding the items affecting comparability between periods the increase in corporate expenses in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily reflects the expensing of stock options commencing january 1 2006 and increases in insurance costs recurring aftertax corporate expenses in 2007 are estimated to be in the range of 115 to 125 million 

 

in 2005 the american jobs creation act provided for a onetime reduction in the income tax rate to 525 on the remittance of eligible dividends from foreign subsidiaries to a united states parent the corporation repatriated 19 billion of previously unremitted foreign earnings resulting in the recognition of an income tax provision of 72 million the pretax amount of bond repurchase premiums in 2005 was 39 million and is reflected in nonoperating income in the income statement the pretax amount of the 2004 corporate insurance accrual was 20 million and is reflected in nonoperating income 

 

interest

sales and other operating revenues 

 

sales and other operating revenues totaled 28067 million in 2006 an increase of 23 compared with 2005 the increase reflects higher selling prices of crude oil higher sales volumes and reduced crude oil hedge positions in exploration and production activities and higher selling prices and sales volumes in marketing activities in 2005 sales and other operating revenues totaled 22747 million an increase of 36 compared with 2004 this increase principally reflects higher selling prices of crude oil and natural gas in exploration and production and higher 

selling prices and sales volumes in marketing activities the change in cost of goods sold in each year reflects the change in sales volumes and prices of refined products and purchased natural gas

accounting policies 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

accounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of assets and liabilities on the corporation’s balance sheet and revenues and expenses on the income statement the accounting methods used can affect net income stockholders’ equity and various financial statement ratios however the corporation’s accounting policies generally do not change cash flows or liquidity 

 

accounting for exploration and development costs exploration and production activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage including lease bonuses brokers’ fees and other related costs are capitalized annual lease rentals exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred costs of drilling and equipping productive wells including development dry holes and related production facilities are capitalized 

 

the costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if 1 the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and 2 sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project if either of those criteria is not met or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project the capitalized well costs are charged to expense indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves and the economic and operating viability of a project include commitment of project personnel active negotiations for sales contracts with customers negotiations with governments operators and contractors and firm plans for additional drilling and other factors 

 

crude oil and natural gas reserves the determination of estimated proved reserves is a significant element in arriving at the results of operations of exploration and production activities the estimates of proved reserves affect well capitalizations the unit of production depreciation rates of proved properties and wells and equipment as well as impairment testing of oil and gas assets and goodwill 

 

the corporation’s oil and gas reserves are calculated in accordance with sec regulations and interpretations and the requirements of the financial accounting standards board for reserves to be booked as proved they must be commercially producible government and project operator approvals must be obtained and depending on the amount of the project cost senior management or the board of directors must commit to fund the project the corporation’s oil and gas reserve estimation and reporting process involves an annual independent third party reserve determination as well as internal technical appraisals of reserves the corporation maintains its own internal reserve estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work directly with the oil and gas properties the corporation’s technical staff updates reserve estimates throughout the year based on evaluations of new wells performance reviews new technical data and other studies to provide consistency throughout the corporation standard reserve estimation guidelines definitions reporting reviews and approval practices are used the internal reserve estimates are subject to internal technical audits and senior management reviews the estimates 

 

the oil and gas reserve estimates reported in the supplementary oil and gas data in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards fas no 69 disclosures about oil and gas producing activities fas no 69 are determined independently by the consulting firm of degolyer and macnaughton dm and are consistent with internal estimates annually the corporation provides dm with engineering geological and geophysical data actual production histories and other information necessary for the reserve determination the corporation’s and dm’s technical staffs meet to review and discuss the information provided senior management and the board of directors review the final reserve estimates issued by dm 

 

impairment of longlived assets and goodwill as explained below there are significant differences in the way longlived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing the corporation reviews longlived assets including oil and gas fields for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered longlived assets are tested based on identifiable cash flows the field level for oil and gas assets and are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities if the carrying amounts of the longlived assets are not expected to be recovered by undiscounted future net cash flow 

estimates the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded the amount of impairment is based on the estimated fair value of the assets determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows 

 

in the case of oil and gas fields the present value of future net cash flows is based on management’s best estimate of future prices which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices applied to projected production volumes of individual fields and discounted at a rate commensurate with the risks involved the projected production volumes represent reserves including probable reserves expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures the production volumes prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairments will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows since the standardized measure requires the use of actual prices on the last day of the year 

 

the corporation’s impairment tests of longlived exploration and production producing assets are based on its best estimates of future production volumes including recovery factors selling prices operating and capital costs and the timing of future production which are updated each time an impairment test is performed the corporation could have impairments if the projected production volumes from oil and gas fields were reduced significant extended declines in crude oil and natural gas selling prices could also result in asset impairments 

 

in accordance with fas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets fas no 142 the corporation’s goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter at a reporting unit level the reporting unit or units used to evaluate and measure goodwill for impairment are determined primarily from the manner in which the business is managed the corporation’s goodwill is assigned to the exploration and production operating segment and it expects that the benefits of goodwill will be recovered through the operation of that segment 

 

the corporation’s fair value estimate of the exploration and production segment is the sum of 1 the discounted anticipated cash flows of producing assets and known developments 2 the estimated risk adjusted present value of exploration assets and 3 an estimated market premium to reflect the market price an acquirer would pay for potential synergies including cost savings access to new business opportunities enterprise control improved processes and increased market share the corporation also considers the relative market valuation of similar exploration and production companies 

 

the determination of the fair value of the exploration and production operating segment depends on estimates about oil and gas reserves future prices timing of future net cash flows and market premiums significant extended declines in crude oil and natural gas prices or reduced reserve estimates could lead to a decrease in the fair value of the exploration and production operating segment that could result in an impairment of goodwill 

 

because there are significant differences in the way longlived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing there may be impairments of individual assets that would not cause an impairment of the goodwill assigned to the exploration and production segment 

 

segments the corporation has two operating segments exploration and production and marketing and refining management has determined that these are its operating segments because in accordance with fas no 131 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information fas no 131 these are the segments of the corporation i that engage in business activities from which revenues are earned and expenses are incurred ii whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the corporation’s chief operating decision maker codm to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance and iii for which discrete financial information is available the chairman of the board and chief executive officer of the corporation is the codm as defined in fas no 131 because he is responsible for performing the functions within the corporation of allocating resources to and assessing the performance of the corporation’s operating segments 

 

derivatives the corporation utilizes derivative instruments for both nontrading and trading activities in nontrading activities the corporation uses futures forwards options and swaps individually or in combination to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in the prices of crude oil natural gas refined products and electricity and changes in foreign currency exchange rates in trading activities the corporation principally through a consolidated 

partnership trades energy commodities derivatives including futures forwards options and swaps based on expectations of future market conditions 

 

all derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in the corporation’s balance sheet the corporation’s policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative the changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges under fas no 133 are recognized currently in earnings derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions cash flow hedges or hedges of firm commitments fair value hedges the effective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income loss amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings the ineffective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recorded currently in earnings changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings the change in fair value of the related hedged commitment is recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized currently in earnings 

 

derivatives that are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges are tested for effectiveness prospectively before they are executed and both prospectively and retrospectively on an ongoing basis to determine whether they continue to qualify for hedge accounting the prospective and retrospective effectiveness calculations are performed using either historical simulation or other statistical models which utilize historical observable market data consisting of futures curves and spot prices 

 

income taxes judgments are required in the determination and recognition of income tax assets and liabilities in the financial statements the corporation has net operating loss carryforwards in several jurisdictions including the united states and has recorded deferred tax assets for those losses additionally the corporation has deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized in evaluating realizability of deferred tax assets the corporation refers to the reversal periods for temporary differences available carryforward periods for net operating losses estimates of future taxable income the availability of tax planning strategies the existence of appreciated assets and other factors estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas reserves and selling prices that are consistent with the corporation’s internal business forecasts 

 

changes in accounting policies 

 

effective january 1 2006 the corporation adopted the provisions of fas no 123r sharebased payment fas no 123r fas no 123r requires that the fair value of all stockbased compensation to employees including grants of stock options be expensed over the vesting period through december 31 2005 the corporation used the intrinsic value method to account for employee stock options because the exercise prices of employee stock options equaled or exceeded the market price of the stock on the date of grant the corporation did not recognize compensation expense under the intrinsic value method see note 9 “sharebased compensation” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

 

in september 2006 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fas no 158 employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans fas no 158 fas no 158 requires recognition on the balance sheet of the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation as required the corporation prospectively adopted the provisions of fas no 158 on december 31 2006 see note 11 “retirement plans” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

 

recently issued accounting standards 

 

in september 2006 the fasb issued staff position fsp aug air1 accounting for planned major maintenance activities this fsp eliminates the previously acceptable accrueinadvance method of accounting for planned major maintenance as a result the corporation will retrospectively change its method of accounting for 

refinery turnarounds on january 1 2007 the effective date of this pronouncement to recognize expenses associated with refinery turnarounds when such costs are incurred under the retrospective method of adoption the corporation expects to increase 2006 earnings by approximately 4 million reduce 2005 earnings by approximately 16 million and increase retained earnings as of january 1 2005 by approximately 66 million 

 

in july 2006 the fasb issued interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 48 fin 48 prescribes the financial statement recognition and measurement criteria for a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return fin 48 also requires additional disclosures related to uncertain income tax positions as required the corporation will adopt the provisions of fin 48 effective january 1 2007 the corporation has not concluded its evaluation of the impact of adopting fin 48 on its results of operations financial position or cash flows 

 

in september 2006 the fasb issued fas no 157 fair value measurements fas no 157 fas no 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy which applies broadly to financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value under other authoritative accounting pronouncements additionally the standard requires increased disclosure of the methods of determining fair value the corporation is currently evaluating the impact of adoption on its financial statements and as required the corporation will adopt the provisions of fas no 157 effective january 1 2008 

 

environment health and safety 

 

the corporation has implemented a valuesbased sociallyresponsible strategy focused on improving environment health and safety performance and making a positive impact on communities the strategy is supported by the corporation’s environment health safety and social responsibility ehs  sr policies and by environment and safety management systems that help protect the corporation’s workforce customers and local communities the corporation’s management systems are designed to uphold or exceed international standards and are intended to promote internal consistency adherence to policy objectives and continual improvement in ehs  sr performance improved performance may in the shortterm increase the corporation’s operating costs and could also require increased capital expenditures to reduce potential risks to assets reputation and license to operate in addition to enhanced ehs  sr performance improved productivity and operational efficiencies may be captured as collateral benefits from investments in ehs  sr the corporation has programs in place to evaluate regulatory compliance audit facilities train employees and to generally meet corporate ehs  sr goals 

 

the production of motor and other fuels in the united states and elsewhere has faced increasing regulatory pressures in recent years in 2004 new regulations went into effect that have already significantly reduced gasoline sulfur content and additional regulations to reduce the allowable sulfur content in diesel fuel went into effect in 2006 additional reductions in gasoline and fuel oil sulfur content are under consideration fuels production will likely continue to be subject to more stringent regulation in future years and as such may require additional capital expenditures 

 

capital expenditures necessary to comply with lowsulfur gasoline requirements at port reading were 72 million of which 23 million was spent in 2005 and the remainder was spent in 2006 capital expenditures to comply with lowsulfur gasoline and diesel fuel requirements at hovensa are presently expected to be approximately 420 million in total 360 million of which has already been spent and the remainder is expected to be spent in 2007 hovensa has and continues to plan to finance these capital expenditures through cash flow from operations 

 

the energy policy act of 2005 eliminated the clean air act’s mandatory oxygen content requirement for reformulated gasoline and imposes on refiners a requirement to use specific quantities of renewable content in gasoline many states have also enacted bans on the use of mtbe in gasoline many of which will take effect between 2007 and 2009 as a result several companies have announced their intention to cease using mtbe since it will no longer be needed in reformulated gasoline to comply with the clean air act and does not meet the new renewable content requirement in response to these changes in the gasoline marketplace the corporation and hovensa phased out the use of ether based oxygenates during 2006 both companies are reviewing the most cost effective means to replace ether unit processing capabilities which may necessitate additional capital investments 

 

as described in item 3 “legal proceedings” in 2003 the corporation and hovensa began discussions with the us epa regarding the epa’s petroleum refining initiative pri the pri is an ongoing program that is designed to reduce certain air emissions at all us refineries since 2000 the epa has entered into settlements addressing these emissions with petroleum refining companies that control over 77 of the domestic refining capacity negotiations with the epa are continuing and depending on the outcome of these discussions the corporation and hovensa may experience increased capital expenditures and operating expenses related to air emissions controls settlements with other refiners allow for controls to be phased in over several years 

 

hovensa is constructing a new wastewater treatment system at the refinery this project will significantly enhance the refinery’s ability to treat wastewater and better protect the marine environment of st croix the cost to complete the project is approximately 120 million of which 55 million has already been incurred 

 

the corporation has undertaken a program to assess monitor and reduce the emission of “greenhouse gases” including carbon dioxide and methane the challenges associated with this program are significant not only from the standpoint of technical feasibility but also from the perspective of adequately measuring the corporation’s greenhouse gas inventory the corporation has completed a revised monitoring protocol which will allow for better measurement of “greenhouse gases” and is conducting an independently verified audit of its emissions once completed the monitoring protocol will allow for better control of these emissions and assist the corporation in complying with any future regulatory restrictions 

 

the corporation expects continuing expenditures for environmental assessment and remediation related primarily to existing conditions sites where corrective action may be necessary include gasoline stations terminals onshore exploration and production facilities refineries including solid waste management units under permits issued pursuant to the resource conservation and recovery act and although not currently significant “superfund” sites where the corporation has been named a potentially responsible party

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

in the normal course of its business the corporation is exposed to commodity risks related to changes in the price of crude oil natural gas refined products and electricity as well as to changes in interest rates and foreign currency values in the disclosures that follow these operations are referred to as nontrading activities the corporation also has trading operations principally through a 50 voting interest in a trading partnership these activities are also exposed to commodity risks primarily related to the prices of crude oil natural gas and refined products the following describes how these risks are controlled and managed 

 

controls the corporation maintains a control environment under the direction of its chief risk officer and through its corporate risk policy which the corporation’s senior management has approved controls include 

volumetric term and valueatrisk limits in addition the chief risk officer must approve the use of new instruments or commodities risk limits are monitored daily and exceptions are reported to business units and to senior management the corporation’s risk management department also performs independent verifications of sources of fair values and validations of valuation models these controls apply to all of the corporation’s nontrading and trading activities including the consolidated trading partnership the corporation’s treasury department administers foreign exchange rate and interest rate hedging programs 

 

instruments the corporation primarily uses forward commodity contracts foreign exchange forward contracts futures swaps options and energy commodity based securities in its nontrading and trading activities these contracts are generally widely traded instruments with standardized terms the following describes these instruments and how the corporation uses them 

 

  

valueatrisk the corporation uses valueatrisk to monitor and control commodity risk within its trading and nontrading activities the valueatrisk model uses historical simulation and the results represent the potential loss in fair value over one day at a 95 confidence level the model captures both first and second order sensitivities for options the following table summarizes the valueatrisk results for trading and nontrading activities these 

results may vary from time to time as strategies change in trading activities or hedging levels change in nontrading activities 

 

 

 

 

nontrading the corporation’s nontrading activities may include hedging of crude oil and natural gas production futures and swaps are used to fix the selling prices of a portion of the corporation’s future production and the related gains or losses are an integral part of the corporation’s selling prices following is a summary of the corporation’s outstanding crude oil hedges at december 31 2006 

 

 

 

 

there were no hedges of wti crude oil or natural gas production at december 31 2006 as market conditions change the corporation may adjust its hedge percentages the corporation also markets energy commodities including refined petroleum products natural gas and electricity the corporation uses futures and swaps to manage the risk in its marketing activities 

 

accumulated other comprehensive income loss at december 31 2006 includes aftertax unrealized deferred losses of 1338 million primarily related to crude oil contracts used as hedges of exploration and production sales the pretax amount of deferred hedge losses is reflected in accounts payable and the related income tax benefits are recorded as deferred tax assets on the balance sheet 

 

the corporation uses foreign exchange contracts to reduce its exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates by entering into forward purchase contracts for both the british pound sterling and the danish kroner at december 31 2006 the corporation had 729 million of notional value foreign exchange contracts maturing in 2007 the fair value of the foreign exchange contracts was a receivable of 51 million at december 31 2006 the change in fair value of the foreign exchange contracts from a 10 change in exchange rates is estimated to be approximately 80 million at december 31 2006 

 

the corporation’s outstanding debt of 3772 million has a fair value of 4105 million at december 31 2006 a 15 decrease in the rate of interest would increase the fair value of debt by approximately 300 million at december 31 2006 

 

trading in trading activities the corporation is exposed to changes in crude oil natural gas and refined product prices the trading partnership in which the corporation has a 50 voting interest trades energy 

commodities and derivatives the accounts of the partnership are consolidated with those of the corporation the corporation also takes trading positions for its own account the information that follows represents 100 of the trading partnership and the corporation’s proprietary trading accounts 

 

gains or losses from sales of physical products are recorded at the time of sale derivative trading transactions are markedtomarket and are reflected in income currently total realized gains for the year amounted to 721 million 297 million of realized losses for 2005 the following table provides an assessment of the factors affecting the changes in fair value of trading activities and represents 100 of the trading partnership and other trading activities 

 

 

 

 

the corporation uses observable market values for determining the fair value of its trading instruments in cases where actively quoted prices are not available other external sources are used which incorporate information about commodity prices in actively quoted markets quoted prices in less active markets and other market fundamental analysis internal estimates are based on internal models incorporating underlying market information such as commodity volatilities and correlations the corporation’s risk management department regularly compares valuations to independent sources and models 

 

the following table summarizes the sources of fair values of derivatives used in the corporation’s trading activities at december 31

 item 1a risk factors related to our business and operations tableend   our business activities and the value of our securities are subject to significant risk factors including those described below the risk factors described below could negatively affect our operations financial condition liquidity and results of operations and holders and purchasers of our securities could lose part or all of their investments additional risks relating to our securities may be included in the prospectus supplements for securities we issue in the future 

crude oil and natural gas price risk our estimated proved reserves revenue operating cash flows and future earnings are highly dependent on the prices of crude oil and natural gas which are influenced by numerous factors beyond our control historically these prices have been very volatile the major foreign oil producing countries including members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec exert considerable influence over the supply and price of crude oil and refined petroleum products their ability or inability to agree on a common policy on rates of production and other matters has a significant impact on the oil markets the derivatives markets are also important in influencing the selling prices of crude oil natural gas and refined petroleum products a significant downward trend in commodity prices would have a material adverse effect on our revenues profitability and cash flow and could result in a reduction in the carrying value of our oil and gas assets goodwill and proved oil and gas reserves to the extent that we engage in hedging activities to mitigate commodity price volatility we will not realize the benefit of price increases above the hedged price 

technical risk we own or have access to a finite amount of oil and gas reserves which will be depleted over time replacement of oil and gas reserves is subject to successful exploration drilling development activities and enhanced recovery programs therefore future oil and gas production is dependent on technical success in finding and developing additional quantities of proved reserves exploration activity involves the interpretation of seismic and other geological and geophysical data which does not always successfully predict the presence of commercial quantities of hydrocarbons drilling risks include adverse unexpected conditions irregularities in pressure or formations equipment failure blowouts and weather interruptions future developments may be affected by unforeseen reservoir conditions which negatively affect recovery factors or flow rates the costs of drilling and development activities have also been increasing which could negatively affect expected economic returns although due diligence is used in evaluating acquired oil and gas properties similar uncertainties may be encountered in the production of oil and gas on properties acquired from others 

oil and gas reserves and discounted future net cash flow risks numerous uncertainties exist in estimating quantities of proved reserves and future net revenues from those reserves actual future production oil and gas prices revenues taxes capital expenditures operating expenses geologic success and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates and could materially affect the estimated quantities and future net revenues of our proved reserves in addition reserve estimates may be subject to downward or upward revisions based on production performance purchases or sales of properties results of future development prevailing oil and gas prices and other factors 

political risk federal state local territorial and foreign laws and regulations relating to tax increases and retroactive tax claims expropriation of property cancellation of contract rights and changes in import regulations as well as other political developments may affect our operations we have been affected by certain of these events in several countries in which we operate some of the international areas in which we operate may be politically less stable than our domestic operations we market motor fuels through lesseedealers and wholesalers in certain states where legislation prohibits producers or refiners of crude oil from directly engaging in retail marketing of motor fuels similar legislation has been periodically proposed in the us congress and in various other states 

10 environmental risk our oil and gas operations like those of the industry are subject to environmental hazards such as oil spills produced water spills gas leaks and ruptures and discharges of substances or gases that could expose us to substantial liability for pollution or other environmental damage our operations are also subject to numerous united states federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations noncompliance with these laws and regulations may subject us to administrative civil or criminal penalties remedial cleanups and natural resource damages or other liabilities in addition increasingly stringent environmental regulations particularly relating to the production of motor and other fuels has resulted and will likely continue to result in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us and the oil and gas industry generally 

competitive risk the petroleum industry is highly competitive and very capital intensive we encounter competition from numerous companies in each of our activities particularly in acquiring rights to explore for crude oil and natural gas and in the purchasing and marketing of refined products and natural gas many competitors including national oil companies are larger and have substantially greater resources we are also in competition with producers and marketers of other forms of energy increased competition for worldwide oil and gas assets has significantly increased the cost of acquisitions in addition competition for drilling services and equipment has affected the availability of drilling rigs and increased capital and operating costs

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend   as disclosed in registrant’s form 10k for the fiscal year ended december 31 2004 the form 10k purported class actions consolidated under a complaint captioned in re amerada hess securities litigation were pending in united states district court for the district of new jersey against registrant and certain executive officers and former executive officers of the registrant alleging that these individuals sold shares of the registrant’s common stock in advance of the registrant’s acquisition of triton energy limited triton in 2001 in violation of federal securities laws in april 2003 the registrant and the other defendants filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim and failure to plead fraud with particularity on march 31 2004 the court granted the defendant’s motion to dismiss the complaint the plaintiffs were granted leave to file an amended complaint plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in june 2004 defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint in june 2005 this motion was denied defendants believe this action is without merit and will continue to defend this action vigorously 

  the registrant along with many other companies engaged in refining and marketing of gasoline has been a party to lawsuits and claims related to the use of the methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe in gasoline a series of substantially identical lawsuits many involving water utilities or governmental entities were filed in jurisdictions across the united states against producers of mtbe and petroleum refiners who produce gasoline containing mtbe including registrant these cases have been consolidated in the southern district of new york and registrant is named as a defendant in 40 of the 70 cases pending the principal allegation in all cases is that gasoline containing mtbe is a defective product and that these parties are strictly liable in proportion to their share of the gasoline market for damage to groundwater resources and are required to take remedial action to ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of releases of mtbe in some cases punitive damages are also sought in april 2005 the district court denied the primary legal aspects of the defendants’ motion to dismiss these actions while the damages claimed in these actions are substantial only limited information is available to evaluate the factual and legal merits of those claims the corporation also believes that significant legal uncertainty remains regarding the validity of causes of action asserted and availability of the relief sought by plaintiffs accordingly based on the information currently available there is insufficient information on which to evaluate the corporation’s exposure in these cases 

  over the last several years many refiners have entered into consent agreements to resolve epa’s assertions that refining facilities were modified or expanded without complying with new source review regulations that require permits and new emission controls in certain circumstances and other regulations that impose emissions control requirements these consent agreements which arise out of an epa enforcement initiative focusing on petroleum refiners and utilities have typically imposed substantial civil fines and penalties and required i significant capital expenditures to install emissions control equipment over a three to eight year time period and ii changes to operations which resulted in increased operating costs epa initially contacted registrant and hovensa llc hovensa its 50 owned joint venture with petroleos de venezuela regarding the petroleum refinery initiative in august 2003 and discussions resumed in august 2005 registrant and hovensa expect to have further discussions with epa regarding the petroleum refining initiative although both registrant and hovensa have already installed many of the pollution controls required of other refiners under the consent agreements and epa has not made any specific assertions that either registrant or hovensa violated either new source review or other regulations which would require additional controls while the effect on the corporation of the petroleum refinery initiative cannot be estimated at this time additional future capital expenditures and operating expenses may be incurred the amount of penalties if any is not expected to be material to the corporation 

  registrant is one of over 60 companies that have received a directive from the new jersey department of environmental protection njdep to remediate contamination in the sediments of the lower passaic river and njdep is also seeking natural resource damages the directive insofar as it affects registrant relates to alleged releases from a petroleum bulk storage terminal in newark new jersey now owned by registrant epa has also issued an administrative order on consent relating to the same contamination while njdep has suggested a remedial cost of over 900 million the costs of remediation of the passaic river sediments are the subject of a remedial investigation and feasibility study currently being conducted on a portion of the river by epa under an agreement with registrant and over 40 other companies thus remedial costs cannot be 

12 reliably estimated at this time based on currently known facts and circumstances registrant does not believe that this matter will result in material liability because its terminal could not have contributed contamination along most of the river’s length and did not store or use contaminants which are of the greatest concern in the river sediments and because there are numerous other parties who will likely share in the cost of remediation and damages 

  on or about july 15 2004 hess oil virgin islands corp hovic a wholly owned subsidiary of registrant and hovensa llc in which registrant owns a 50 interest each received a letter from the commissioner of the virgin islands department of planning and natural resources and natural resources trustees advising of the trustee’s intention to bring suit against hovic and hovensa under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla the letter alleges that hovic and hovensa are potentially responsible for damages to natural resources arising from releases of hazardous substances from the “hovensa oil refinery” hovensa currently owns and operates a petroleum refinery on the south shore of st croix united states virgin islands which had been operated by hovic until october 1998 an action was filed on may 5 2005 in the district court of the virgin islands against hovensa hovic and other companies that operated industrial facilities on the south shore of st croix asserting that the defendants are liable under cercla and territorial statutory and common law for damages to natural resources hovic and hovensa do not believe that this matter will result in a material liability as they believe that they have strong defenses to this complaint and they intend to vigorously defend this matter 

  the securities and exchange commission sec has notified the registrant that on july 21 2005 it commenced a private investigation into payments made to the government of equatorial guinea or to officials and persons affiliated with officials of the government of equatorial guinea the staff of the sec has requested documents and information from the registrant and other oil and gas companies that have operations or interests in equatorial guinea the staff of the sec had previously been conducting an informal inquiry into such matters the registrant has been cooperating and continues to cooperate with the sec investigation 

  registrant has been served with a complaint from the new york state department of environmental conservation dec relating to alleged violations at its petroleum terminal in brooklyn new york the complaint which seeks an order to shut down the terminal and penalties in unspecified amounts alleges violations involving the structural integrity of certain tanks the erosion of shorelines and bulkheads petroleum discharges and improper certification of tank repairs dec is also seeking relief relating to remediation of certain gasoline stations in the new york metropolitan area registrant believes that many of the allegations are factually inaccurate or based on an incorrect interpretation of applicable law registrant has already addressed the primary conditions discussed in the complaint registrant intends to vigorously contest the complaint but is involved in settlement discussions with dec 

  in june 2001 the corporation voluntarily investigated and disclosed to the new jersey department of environmental protection njdep that there was a calculation error in the program code of the port reading refining facility’s wet gas scrubber wgs continuous emissions monitoring system cem the error in the code resulted in the cem system undercalculating carbon monoxide nitrous oxide nox and sulfur dioxide emissions from the wgs beginning in late 1998 and some exceedances of the permit limits for nox after discovery the code error was promptly corrected in november 2003 the corporation received a notice of violation from the njdep relating to the cem coding error this matter was resolved by payment of 114000 in december 2005

  the registrant periodically receives notices from epa that it is a “potential responsible party” under the superfund legislation with respect to various waste disposal sites under this legislation all potentially responsible parties are jointly and severally liable for certain sites epa’s claims or assertions of liability 

13 against the corporation relating to these sites have not been fully developed with respect to the remaining sites epa’s claims have been settled or a proposed settlement is under consideration in all cases for amounts that are not material the ultimate impact of these proceedings and of any related proceedings by private parties on the business or accounts of the corporation cannot be predicted at this time due to the large number of other potentially responsible parties and the speculative nature of cleanup cost estimates but is not expected to be material 

  the corporation is from time to time involved in other judicial and administrative proceedings including proceedings relating to other environmental matters although the ultimate outcome of these proceedings cannot be ascertained at this time and some of them may be resolved adversely to the corporation no such proceeding is required to be disclosed under applicable rules of the securities and exchange commission in management’s opinion based upon currently known facts and circumstances such proceedings in the aggregate will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the corporation

  the aftertax results by major operating activity are summarized below 

  

  in the discussion that follows the financial effects of certain transactions are disclosed on an aftertax basis management reviews segment earnings on an aftertax basis and uses aftertax amounts in its review of variances in segment earnings management believes that aftertax amounts are a preferable method of explaining variances in earnings since they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only the pretax amount aftertax amounts are determined by applying the appropriate income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pretax amounts 

20   the following items of income expense on an aftertax basis are included in income from continuing operations 

  

  the items in the table above are explained and the pretax amounts are shown on pages 24 through 26 

comparison of results 

   following is a summarized income statement of the corporation’s exploration and production operations 

  

21   after considering the exploration and production items in the table on page 24 the remaining changes in exploration and production earnings are primarily attributable to changes in selling prices production volumes and operating costs and exploration expenses as discussed below 

  selling prices higher average selling prices of crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas increased exploration and production revenues from continuing operations by approximately 870 million including the effect of hedging in 2005 compared with 2004 in 2004 the change in average selling prices increased revenues by approximately 400 million compared with 2003 

  the corporation’s average selling prices including the effects of hedging were as follows

22 its 2006 production will average between 360000 and 380000 boepd including 20000 to 25000 boepd from libya the corporation’s net daily worldwide production was as follows 

  

   crude oil production in the united states in 2005 included increased production from the llano field which offset natural decline and the effect of the hurricanes production in europe was lower due to natural decline and increased maintenance partially offset by new production from russia increased crude oil production in africa is principally due to improved performance from the ceiba field in equatorial guinea natural gas production in asia increased due to new production from the jda 

  decreased sales volumes resulted in lower revenue of approximately 80 million in 2005 and 75 million in 2004 

  operating costs and depreciation depletion and amortization cash operating costs consisting of production expenses and general and administrative expenses increased by 147 million in 2005 and 44 million in 2004 compared with the prior years excluding the hurricane related costs and accrued severance and office lease costs discussed on page 24 production expenses increased in 2005 and 2004 principally reflecting higher maintenance expenses production taxes and fuel costs production expenses in 2005 also increased due to expanded operations in russia and the jda depreciation depletion and amortization charges were higher in 2005 principally due to higher per barrel rates depreciation and related charges were lower in 2004 compared with 2003 reflecting decreased production volumes unit production costs per barrel of oil equivalent comprised of production expense administrative costs and depreciation depletion and amortization totaled 1688 in 2005 1496 in 2004 and 1452 in 2003 unit production costs in 2006 are estimated to be 17 to 19 per barrel of oil equivalent

credit ratings two credit rating agencies have rated the corporation’s debt as investment grade and one rating agency’s rating is below investment grade if another rating agency were to reduce its credit rating below investment grade the corporation would have to comply with a more stringent financial covenant contained in its revolving credit facility in addition margin requirements with nontrading and trading counterparties at december 31 2005 would increase by approximately 30 million 

29 contractual obligations and contingencies following is a table showing aggregated information about certain contractual obligations at december 31 2005 

  

 

   in the preceding table the corporation’s supply commitments include its estimated purchases of 50 of hovensa’s production of refined products after anticipated sales by hovensa to unaffiliated parties the value of future supply commitments will fluctuate based on prevailing market prices at the time of purchase the actual output from hovensa and the level of sales to unaffiliated parties also included are term purchase agreements at market prices for additional gasoline necessary to supply the corporation’s retail marketing system and feedstocks for the port reading refining facility in addition the corporation has commitments to purchase natural gas for use in supplying contracted customers in its energy marketing business these commitments were computed based on yearend market prices 

  the table also reflects that portion of the corporation’s planned 4 billion capital expenditure program that is contractually committed at december 31 obligations for operating expenses include commitments for transportation seismic purchases oil and gas production expenses and other normal business expenses other longterm liabilities reflect contractually committed obligations on the balance sheet at december 31 including minimum pension plan funding requirements

  in december 2005 the minerals management service mms issued an order to the corporation to pay royalties on certain deep water exploration leases in the gulf of mexico held by the corporation in the deep water royalty relief act of 1995 the act congress granted royalty relief in order to encourage deep water exploration in the gulf of mexico with respect to exploration leases issued between november 28 1995 and november 28 2000 the act granted royalty relief without regard to the market price of crude oil and natural gas at the time the royalty is payable however in regulations promulgated by mms relating to these deep water leases the mms imposed a price threshold such that if the market price for crude oil or natural gas exceeded the threshold royalty relief would not be granted the corporation has accrued 34 million for royalties relating to sales from these leases which the corporation believes is its full potential liability if the mms regulations are determined to be valid 

  the corporation has a contingent purchase obligation expiring in april 2010 to acquire the remaining interest in a retail marketing and gasoline station joint venture for approximately 140 million 

  the corporation guarantees the payment of up to 50 of hovensa’s crude oil purchases from suppliers other than pdvsa the amount of the corporation’s guarantee fluctuates based on the volume of crude oil purchased and related prices and at december 31 2005 amounted to 135 million in addition the

foreign operations the corporation conducts exploration and production activities in the united kingdom norway denmark russia equatorial guinea algeria azerbaijan gabon indonesia malaysia thailand libya and other countries therefore the corporation is subject to the risks associated with foreign operations these exposures include political risk including tax law changes and currency risk 

  hovensa llc owned 50 by the corporation and 50 by petroleos de venezuela sa pdvsa owns and operates a refinery in the virgin islands in the past there have been political disruptions in venezuela that reduced the availability of venezuelan crude oil used in refining operations however these disruptions did not have a material adverse effect on the corporation’s financial position the corporation has a note receivable of 212 million at december 31 2005 from a subsidiary of pdvsa all payments are current and the corporation anticipates collection of the remaining balance 

subsequent events 

  in january 2006 the corporation in conjunction with its oasis group partners reentered its former oil and gas production operations in the waha concessions in libya the reentry terms include a 25year extension of the concessions in which the corporation will hold an 816 interest and a payment by the corporation to the libyan national oil corporation of 260 million in addition the corporation will make a payment of 106 million related to certain investments in fixed assets made since 1986 the corporation estimates its net share of 2006 production from libya will average approximately 20000 to 25000 boepd

31 critical accounting policies and estimates 

  accounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of assets and liabilities on the corporation’s balance sheet and revenues and expenses on the income statement the accounting methods used can affect net income stockholders’ equity and various financial statement ratios however the corporation’s accounting policies generally do not change cash flows or liquidity 

  accounting for exploration and development costs exploration and production activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage including lease bonuses brokers’ fees and other related costs are capitalized annual lease rentals exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred costs of drilling and equipping productive wells including development dry holes and related production facilities are capitalized 

  the costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if 1 the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and 2 sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project if either of those criteria is not met or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project the capitalized well costs are charged to expense indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves and the economic and operating viability of a project include commitment of project personnel active negotiations for sales contracts with customers negotiations with governments operators and contractors and firm plans for additional drilling and other factors 

  crude oil and natural gas reserves the determination of estimated proved reserves is a significant element in arriving at the results of operations of exploration and production activities the estimates of proved reserves affect well capitalizations the unit of production depreciation rates of proved properties and wells and equipment as well as impairment testing of oil and gas assets 

  the corporation’s oil and gas reserves are calculated in accordance with sec regulations and interpretations and the requirements of the financial accounting standards board for reserves to be booked as proved they must be commercially producible government and project operator approvals must be obtained and depending on the amount of the project cost senior management or the board of directors must commit to fund the project the corporation’s oil and gas reserve estimation and reporting process involves an annual independent third party reserve determination as well as internal technical appraisals of reserves the corporation maintains its own internal reserve estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work directly with the oil and gas properties the corporation’s technical staff updates reserve estimates throughout the year based on evaluations of new wells performance reviews new technical data and other studies to provide consistency throughout the corporation standard reserve estimation guidelines definitions reporting reviews and approval practices are used the internal reserve estimates are subject to internal technical audits and senior management reviews the estimates 

  the oil and gas reserve estimates reported in the supplementary oil and gas data in accordance with fas no 69 are determined independently by the consulting firm of degolyer and macnaughton dm and are consistent with internal estimates annually the corporation provides dm with engineering geological and geophysical data actual production histories and other information necessary for the reserve determination the corporation’s and dm’s technical staffs meet to review and discuss the information provided senior management and the board of directors review the final reserve estimates issued by dm 

  impairment of longlived assets and goodwill as explained below there are significant differences in the way longlived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing the corporation reviews longlived assets including oil and gas fields for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered longlived assets are tested based on identifiable cash flows the field level for oil and gas assets and are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities if the carrying amounts of the longlived assets are not expected to be recovered by undiscounted future net cash flow estimates the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded the 

32 amount of impairment is based on the estimated fair value of the assets determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows 

  in the case of oil and gas fields the present value of future net cash flows is based on management’s best estimate of future prices which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices applied to projected production volumes of individual fields and discounted at a rate commensurate with the risks involved the projected production volumes represent reserves including probable reserves expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures the production volumes prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairments will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows since the standardized measure requires the use of actual prices on the last day of the year 

  the corporation’s impairment tests of longlived exploration and production producing assets are based on its best estimates of future production volumes including recovery factors selling prices operating and capital costs and the timing of future production which are updated each time an impairment test is performed the corporation could have impairments if the projected production volumes from oil and gas fields were reduced significant extended declines in crude oil and natural gas selling prices could also result in asset impairments 

  in accordance with fas no 142 the corporation’s goodwill is not amortized but must be tested for impairment annually at a reporting unit level the reporting unit or units used to evaluate and measure goodwill for impairment are determined primarily from the manner in which the business is managed the corporation’s goodwill is assigned to the exploration and production operating segment and it expects that the benefits of goodwill will be recovered through the operation of that segment 

  the corporation’s fair value estimate of the exploration and production segment is the sum of 1 the discounted anticipated cash flows of producing assets and known developments 2 the estimated risked present value of exploration assets and 3 an estimated market premium to reflect the market price an acquirer would pay for potential synergies including cost savings access to new business opportunities enterprise control improved processes and increased market share the corporation also considers the relative market valuation of similar exploration and production companies 

  the determination of the fair value of the exploration and production operating segment depends on estimates about oil and gas reserves future prices timing of future net cash flows and market premiums significant extended declines in crude oil and natural gas prices or reduced reserve estimates could lead to a decrease in the fair value of the exploration and production operating segment that could result in an impairment of goodwill 

  because there are significant differences in the way longlived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing there may be impairments of individual assets that would not cause an impairment of the goodwill assigned to the exploration and production segment 

  segments the corporation has two operating segments exploration and production and marketing and refining management has determined that these are its operating segments because in accordance with fas no 131 these are the segments of the corporation i that engage in business activities from which revenues are earned and expenses are incurred ii whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the corporation’s chief operating decision maker codm to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance and iii for which discrete financial information is available the chairman of the board and chief executive officer of the corporation is the codm as defined in fas no 131 because he is responsible for performing the functions within the corporation of allocating resources to and assessing the performance of the corporation’s operating segments 

  hedging the corporation may use futures forwards options and swaps individually or in combination to reduce the effects of fluctuations in crude oil natural gas and refined product prices related hedge gains or losses are an integral part of the selling or purchase prices generally these derivatives are designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions cash flow hedges and the changes in fair 

33 value are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income these transactions meet the requirements for hedge accounting including correlation the corporation’s hedges are tested prospectively before they are executed and both prospectively and retrospectively on an ongoing basis to ensure they continue to qualify for hedge accounting the prospective and retrospective effectiveness calculations are performed using a historical simulation model the simulation utilizes historical observable market data consisting of futures curves and spot prices 

  at december 31 2005 the corporation has 1304 million of deferred hedging losses after income taxes included in accumulated other comprehensive income the corporation reclassifies hedging gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings at the time the hedged transactions are recognized the ineffective portion of hedges is included in current earnings the corporation’s remaining derivatives including foreign currency contracts are not designated as hedges and the change in fair value is included in income currently 

  income taxes judgments are required in the determination and recognition of income tax assets and liabilities in the financial statements the corporation has net operating loss carryforwards in several jurisdictions including the united states and has recorded deferred tax assets for those losses additionally the corporation has deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized in evaluating realizability of deferred tax assets the corporation refers to the reversal periods for temporary differences available carryforward periods for net operating losses estimates of future taxable income the availability of tax planning strategies the existence of appreciated assets and other factors estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas reserves and selling prices that are consistent with the corporation’s internal business forecasts 

  new accounting standard in 2004 the financial accounting standards board reissued statement no 123 sharebased payment fas 123r this standard requires that compensation expense for all stockbased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options be recognized in the income statement based on fair values the corporation adopted fas 123r as of january 1 2006 the actual cost of expensing stock options in 2006 and future periods will be based on a number of factors including the amount of options granted the terms of such awards and the stock price at the time of grant the corporation estimates that the cost of unvested options at december 31 2005 and the annual grant of employee stock options in february 2006 will increase compensation expense in 2006 by approximately 30 million before income taxes awards of restricted common stock are expensed over the vesting period under existing accounting requirements and will continue to be expensed under fas 123r 

environment health and safety 

  the corporation has implemented a valuesbased sociallyresponsible strategy focused on improving environment health and safety performance and making a positive impact on communities the strategy is supported by the corporation’s environment health safety and social responsibility ehs  sr policies and by environment and safety management systems that help protect the corporation’s workforce customers and local communities the corporation’s management systems are designed to uphold or exceed international standards and are intended to promote internal consistency adherence to policy objectives and continual improvement in ehs  sr performance improved performance may in the shortterm increase the corporation’s operating costs and could also require increased capital expenditures to reduce potential risks to assets reputation and license to operate in addition to enhanced ehs  sr performance improved productivity and operational efficiencies may be captured as collateral benefits from investments in ehs  sr while overall governance is the responsibility of senior management the corporation has programs in place to evaluate regulatory compliance audit facilities train employees and to generally meet corporate ehs  sr goals 

34   the production of motor and other fuels in the united states and elsewhere has faced increasing regulatory pressures in recent years in 2004 new regulations went into effect that have already significantly reduced gasoline sulfur content and additional regulations to reduce the allowable sulfur content in diesel fuel went into effect in 2006 additional reductions in gasoline and fuel oil sulfur content are under consideration fuels production will likely continue to be subject to more stringent regulation in future years and as such may require additional capital expenditures 

  estimated capital expenditures necessary to comply with lowsulfur gasoline requirements at port reading will approximate 75 million 23 million of which was spent in 2005 the remainder is expected to be spent in 2006 capital expenditures to comply with lowsulfur gasoline and diesel fuel requirements at hovensa are presently expected to be approximately 410 million in total 160 million of which has already been spent capital expenditures for lowsulfur requirements are expected to be 200 million in 2006 with the remainder in 2007 hovensa plans to finance these capital expenditures through cash flow from operations 

  the energy policy act of 2005 eliminates the clean air act’s mandatory oxygen content requirement for reformulated gasoline and imposes on refiners a requirement to use specific quantities of renewable content in gasoline many states have also enacted bans on the use of mtbe in gasoline many of which will take effect in 20072009 as a result several companies have announced their intention to cease using mtbe since it will no longer be needed in reformulated gasoline to comply with the clean air act and does not meet the new renewable content requirement in response to these changes in the gasoline marketplace the corporation and hovensa will phase out the use of ether based oxygenates in the spring of 2006 the phase out may adversely affect the amount and type of fuels produced at hovensa and port reading both companies are reviewing the most cost effective means to replace ether unit processing capabilities which may necessitate additional capital investments the corporation and hovensa are preparing to meet the renewable content requirement for gasoline and do not anticipate that the impact of this requirement will be significant 

  as described in item 3 “legal proceedings” in 2003 the corporation and hovensa began discussions with the us epa regarding the epa’s petroleum refining initiative pri the pri is an ongoing program that is designed to reduce certain air emissions at all us refineries since 2000 the epa has entered into settlements addressing these emissions with petroleum refining companies that control over 77 of the domestic refining capacity negotiations with the epa are continuing and depending on the outcome of these discussions the corporation and hovensa may experience increased capital expenditures and operating expenses related to air emissions controls settlements with other refiners allow for controls to be phased in over several years 

  hovensa is constructing a new wastewater treatment system at the refinery this project will significantly enhance the refinery’s ability to treat wastewater and better protect the marine environment of st croix the cost to complete the project is approximately 120 million of which 32 million has already been incurred 

  the corporation recognizes the worldwide concern about the environmental and social impact of air emissions on a global scale climate change is an issue that has prompted much public debate and has a potential impact on future economic growth and development the corporation has undertaken a program to assess monitor and reduce the emission of “greenhouse gases” including carbon dioxide and methane the challenges associated with this program may be significant not only from the standpoint of technical feasibility but also from the perspective of adequately measuring the corporation’s greenhouse gas inventory the corporation has recently completed a revised monitoring protocol which will allow for better measurement and control of “greenhouse gases” 

  the corporation expects continuing expenditures for environmental assessment and remediation related primarily to existing conditions sites where corrective action may be necessary include gasoline stations terminals onshore exploration and production facilities refineries including solid waste management units under permits issued pursuant to the resource conservation and recovery act and although not currently significant “superfund” sites where the corporation has been named a potentially responsible party 

35   the corporation accrues for environmental assessment and remediation expenses when the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable at yearend 2005 the corporation’s reserve for its estimated environmental liability was approximately 77 million the corporation expects that existing reserves for environmental liabilities will adequately cover costs to assess and remediate known sites the corporation’s remediation spending was 15 million in 2005 12 million in 2004 and 12 million in 2003 capital expenditures for facilities primarily to comply with federal state and local environmental standards other than for low sulfur projects discussed above were 3 million in 2005 1 million in 2004 and 7 million in 2003

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  in the normal course of its business the corporation is exposed to commodity risks related to changes in the price of crude oil natural gas refined products and electricity as well as to changes in interest rates and foreign currency values in the disclosures that follow these operations are referred to as nontrading activities the corporation also has trading operations principally through a 50 voting interest in a trading partnership these activities are also exposed to commodity risks primarily related to the prices of crude oil natural gas and refined products the following describes how these risks are controlled and managed 

  controls the corporation maintains a control environment under the direction of its chief risk officer and through its corporate risk policy which the corporation’s senior management has approved controls include volumetric term and valueatrisk limits in addition the chief risk officer must approve the use of new instruments or commodities risk limits are monitored daily and exceptions are reported to business units and to senior management the corporation’s risk management department also performs independent verifications of sources of fair values and validations of valuation models these controls apply to all of the corporation’s nontrading and trading activities including the consolidated trading partnership the corporation’s treasury department administers foreign exchange rate and interest rate hedging programs 

  instruments the corporation primarily uses forward commodity contracts foreign exchange forward contracts futures swaps options and energy commodity based securities in its nontrading and trading activities these contracts are widely traded instruments mainly with standardized terms the following describes these instruments and how the corporation uses them 

 36 

   valueatrisk the corporation uses valueatrisk to monitor and control commodity risk within its trading and nontrading activities the valueatrisk model uses historical simulation and the results represent the potential loss in fair value over one day at a 95 confidence level the model captures both first and second order sensitivities for options the following table summarizes the valueatrisk results for trading and nontrading activities these results may vary from time to time as strategies change in trading activities or hedging levels change in nontrading activities 

  

  nontrading the corporation’s nontrading activities may include hedging of crude oil and natural gas production futures and swaps are used to fix the selling prices of a portion of the corporation’s future production and the related gains or losses are an integral part of the corporation’s selling prices following is a summary of the corporation’s outstanding crude oil hedges at december 31 2005 

  

37   there were no hedges of wti crude oil or natural gas production at year end as market conditions change the corporation may adjust its hedge percentages the corporation also markets energy commodities including refined petroleum products natural gas and electricity the corporation uses futures and swaps to manage the risk in its marketing activities 

  accumulated other comprehensive income loss at december 31 2005 includes aftertax unrealized deferred losses of 1304 million primarily related to crude oil contracts used as hedges of exploration and production sales the pretax amount of deferred hedge losses is reflected in accounts payable and the related income tax benefits are recorded as deferred tax assets on the balance sheet 

  the corporation uses foreign exchange contracts to reduce its exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates by entering into forward purchase contracts for both the british pound sterling and the danish kroner at december 31 2005 the corporation has 677 million of notional value foreign exchange contracts maturing in 2006 and 2007 476 million at december 31 2004 the fair value of the foreign exchange contracts was a liability of 31 million at december 31 2005 receivable of 49 million at december 31 2004 the change in fair value of the foreign exchange contracts from a 10 change in exchange rates is estimated to be 64 million at december 31 2005 53 million at december 31 2004 

  the corporation’s outstanding debt of 3785 million has a fair value of 4286 million at december 31 2005 debt of 3835 million at december 31 2004 had a fair value of 4327 million a 15 change in the rate of interest would change the fair value of debt by approximately 250 million at december 31 2005 and by approximately 260 million at december 31 2004 

  trading in trading activities the corporation is exposed to changes in crude oil natural gas and refined product prices the trading partnership in which the corporation has a 50 voting interest trades energy commodities and derivatives the accounts of the partnership are consolidated with those of the corporation the corporation also takes trading positions for its own account the information that follows represents 100 of the trading partnership and the corporation’s proprietary trading accounts 

  gains or losses from sales of physical products are recorded at the time of sale derivative trading transactions are markedto market and are reflected in income currently total realized losses for the year amounted to 297 million 79 million of realized gains for 2004 the following table provides an assessment of the factors affecting the changes in fair value of trading activities and represents 100 of the trading partnership and other trading activities 

  

  the corporation uses observable market values for determining the fair value of its trading instruments in cases where actively quoted prices are not available other external sources are used which incorporate information about commodity prices in actively quoted markets quoted prices in less active markets and other market fundamental analysis internal estimates are based on internal models incorporating underlying market information such as commodity volatilities and correlations the corporation’s risk management department

competition and market conditions 

  the petroleum industry is highly competitive the corporation encounters competition from numerous companies in each of its activities particularly in acquiring rights to explore for crude oil and natural gas and in the purchasing and marketing of refined products and natural gas many competitors are larger and have substantially greater resources than the corporation the corporation is also in competition with producers and marketers of other forms of energy 

  the petroleum business involves largescale capital expenditures and risktaking in the search for new oil and gas reserves long lead times are often required from successful exploration to subsequent production operations in the petroleum industry are dependent upon a depleting natural resource the number of areas where it can be expected that hydrocarbons will be discovered in commercial quantities is constantly diminishing and exploration risks are high areas where hydrocarbons may be found are often in remote locations or offshore where exploration and development activities are capital intensive and operating costs are high 

6   the major foreign oil producing countries including members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec exert considerable influence over the supply and price of crude oil and refined petroleum products their ability or inability to agree on a common policy on rates of production and other matters has a significant impact on oil markets and the corporation the derivatives markets are also important in influencing the selling prices of crude oil natural gas and refined products the corporation cannot predict the extent to which future market conditions may be affected by foreign oil producing countries the derivatives markets or other external influences 

other items 

  federal state local territorial and foreign laws and regulations relating to tax increases and retroactive tax claims expropriation of property cancellation of contract rights and changes in import regulations as well as other political developments may affect the corporation’s operations the corporation has been affected by certain of these events in various countries in which it operates the corporation markets motor fuels through lesseedealers and wholesalers in certain states where legislation prohibits producers or refiners of crude oil from directly engaging in retail marketing of motor fuels similar legislation has been periodically proposed in the us congress and in various other states the corporation at this time cannot predict the effect of any of the foregoing on its future operations 

  compliance with various existing environmental and pollution control regulations imposed by federal state and local governments is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the corporation’s earnings and competitive position within the industry the corporation spent 12 million in 2004 for environmental remediation with a comparable amount anticipated for 2005 capital expenditures for facilities primarily to comply with federal state and local environmental standards were 1 million in 2004 and the corporation anticipates approximately 35 million in 2005 regulatory changes already made or anticipated in the united states will alter the composition and emissions characteristics of motor fuels future capital expenditures necessary to comply with these regulations will be substantial the environmental protection agency has adopted rules that limit the amount of sulfur in gasoline and diesel fuel capital expenditures necessary to comply with the lowsulfur gasoline requirements at port reading are estimated to be approximately 70 million over the next two years capital expenditures to comply with lowsulfur gasoline and diesel fuel requirements at hovensa are currently expected to be approximately 400 million over the next two years 50 million of which has already been spent hovensa expects to finance these capital expenditures through cash flow and if necessary future borrowings

  over the last several years many refiners have entered into consent agreements to resolve epa’s assertions that refining facilities were modified or expanded without complying with new source review regulations that require permits and new emission controls in certain circumstances and other regulations that impose emissions control requirements these consent agreements which arise out of an epa enforcement initiative focusing on petroleum refiners and utilities have typically imposed substantial civil fines and penalties and required significant capital expenditures to install emissions control equipment epa contacted registrant and hovensa llc hovensa its 50 owned joint venture with petroleos de venezuela regarding the petroleum refinery initiative in august 2003 and held an initial meeting in october 2003 while epa has not made any specific assertions that the registrant or hovensa violated the new source review regulations the registrant and hovensa expect to have further discussions with epa regarding the petroleum refining initiative 

  in june 2001 the corporation voluntarily investigated and disclosed to the new jersey department of environmental protection njdep that there was a calculation error in the program code of the port reading refining facility’s wet gas scrubber wgs continuous emissions monitoring system cem the error in the code resulted in the cem system under calculating co nox and so 2 emissions from the wgs beginning in late 1998 and some exceedances of the permit limits for nox after discovery the code error was promptly corrected in november 2003 the corporation received a notice of violation from the njdep relating to the cem coding error that proposes a fine of 649600 subsequently revised to 319600 the corporation is engaging in settlement discussions with njdep to resolve this matter particularly as regards to a reduction in the revised penalty to reflect the voluntary selfdisclosure of the issue 

  the registrant along with other companies engaged in refining and marketing of gasoline has been a party to lawsuits and claims related to the use of the methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe in gasoline a series of substantially identical lawsuits many involving water utilities or governmental entities were filed in jurisdictions across the united states against producers of mtbe and petroleum refiners who produce gasoline containing mtbe including registrant these cases have been consolidated in the southern district of new york the principal allegation is that gasoline containing mtbe is a defective product and that these parties are strictly liable in proportion to their share of the gasoline market for damage to groundwater resources and are required to take remedial action to ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of releases of mtbe additional property damage and personal injury lawsuits and claims related to the use of mtbe are expected prior class action product liability based litigation involving mtbe in gasoline has been resolved without a material effect on the registrant while the damages claimed in these actions are substantial registrant has no reason to believe based on factual and legal circumstances currently known to the registrant that these actions will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition however these actions are in their preliminary stages and the factual and legal circumstances may change

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend overview 

  the corporation is a global integrated energy company that operates in two segments exploration and production ep and refining and marketing rm the ep segment explores for produces and sells crude oil and natural gas the rm segment manufactures purchases trades and markets refined petroleum and other energy products 

  the corporation’s goal for the ep segment is to grow reserves and production profitably with its portfolio of development projects and to deliver exploration success during 2002 and 2003 the corporation reshaped its ep asset portfolio by 

   the asset sales and exchanges contributed significantly to the decline in production from 451000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2002 to 342000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2004 in 2005 the corporation forecasts that crude oil and natural gas production will average 350000 barrels of oil equivalent per day 

  in 2004 the corporation continued to make progress in its development projects that are expected to provide significant new production in 2006 and 2007 which will more than offset natural declines in existing fields milestones accomplished on our development projects in 2004 were 

   during 2004 the corporation drilled successful appraisal wells at the shenzi prospect in the deepwater gulf of mexico at the phu horm field onshore thailand and at ujung pangkah in december the corporation announced a natural gas discovery at the belud prospect offshore malaysia the corporation has an inventory of exploration prospects and will drill several high impact wells in 2005 

  the corporation has two exploration wells currently drilling in the gulf of mexico that will have estimated pretax capitalized drilling costs of approximately 100 to 110 million upon completion if either or both of these wells are unsuccessful aftertax first quarter 2005 earnings would be reduced by up to 70 million 

17   proved reserves increased to 1046 billion barrels of oil equivalent at yearend 2004 from 1035 billion barrels of oil equivalent at the end of 2003 the corporation’s reserves included in this form 10k are calculated by an independent third party reserve engineer see further discussion of management’s governance over the estimation of oil and gas reserves in the supplementary oil and gas data on page 73 

  the strategic goals for rm are to maximize returns from existing assets and generate free cash flow the corporation may grow the retail and energy marketing businesses opportunistically during 2004 and 2003 the rm segment’s results improved significantly primarily due to higher refining margins the hovensa and port reading refineries operated near maximum capacity for most of the year enabling them to take full advantage of the strong margins hovensa’s capacity to process lower cost heavy crude oil enhanced profitability in 2004 due to a significant price differential between light and heavy crude oil in 2004 the corporation received a cash distribution of 88 million from hovensa the hovensa fluid catalytic cracking unit was shutdown for approximately 30 days of planned maintenance in the first quarter of 2005 planned maintenance of the fluid catalytic cracking unit at the port reading facility is underway and expected to last for approximately 30 days 

  the corporation’s liquidity and financial position have improved significantly since yearend 2002 at december 31 2002 the corporation’s debt was 5 billion and its debt to capitalization ratio was 54 as of december 31 2004 the corporation’s debt has been reduced to 38 billion and the debt to capitalization ratio was 407 aggregate debt maturities through 2006 are 128 million the corporation’s cash balance at december 31 2004 was 877 million 

  capital expenditures were 15 billion in 2004 14 billion in 2003 and 15 billion in 2002 capital expenditures for 2005 are forecast to be 21 billion with 20 billion dedicated to the exploration and production segment this higher spending reflects the corporation’s portfolio of organic growth projects and attractive investment opportunities the corporation has hedged approximately 60 of its 2005 worldwide crude oil production to underpin its cash flows to fund development projects see further discussion on hedging starting on page 34 

consolidated results of operations 

  net income in 2004 was 977 million compared with net income of 643 million in 2003 and a net loss of 218 million in 2002 including impairments included in these amounts was income from discontinued operations of 7 million in 2004 169 million in 2003 and 27 million in 2002 see the following page for a table of items affecting the comparability of earnings between periods 

  the aftertax results by major operating activity for 2004 2003 and 2002 are summarized below 

  

18   in the discussion that follows the financial effects of certain transactions are disclosed on an aftertax basis management reviews segment earnings on an aftertax basis and uses aftertax amounts in its review of variances in segment earnings management believes that aftertax amounts are a preferable method of explaining variances in earnings since they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only the pretax amount aftertax amounts are determined by applying the appropriate income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pretax amounts 

  the following items on an aftertax basis are included in income from continuing operations for the years 2004 2003 and 2002 

  

  the items in the table above are explained on pages 21 through 24 the pretax amounts are shown on pages 21 23 and 24 

comparison of results 

  exploration and production after considering the exploration and production items in the preceding table the remaining changes in exploration and production earnings are primarily attributable to changes in selling prices production volumes and operating costs and exploration expenses as discussed below 

  selling prices higher average selling prices of crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas increased exploration and production revenues from continuing operations by approximately 400 million in 2004 compared with 2003 in 2003 the change in average selling prices increased revenues by approximately 170 million compared with 2002 the corporation’s average selling prices from continuing operations including the effects of hedging were as follows 

  

19   the aftertax impacts of crude oil and us natural gas hedges reduced earnings by 583 million 935 million before income taxes in 2004 and 260 million 418 million before income taxes in 2003 compared with an increase of 48 million 82 million before income taxes in 2002 

  the corporation has aftertax deferred hedge losses of 875 million recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income at december 31 2004 of this amount 680 million is unrealized and relates to open hedge positions the remaining 195 million deferred loss is realized and relates to closed hedge positions the deferred realized loss will be recognized in earnings as the underlying barrels are sold in 2005 

  the corporation has open hedge positions equal to 60 of its estimated worldwide crude oil production for 2005 the average price per barrel for open united states crude oil hedges is 3306 the average price for open foreign crude oil hedges is 3117 approximately 20 of the corporation’s hedges are wti related and the remainder are brent in addition to the gains or losses on these open hedge positions approximately 52 million of the 195 million deferred realized loss will reduce first quarter 2005 earnings and the remaining deferred realized loss will be recognized in earnings over the balance of the year the corporation also has approximately 24000 barrels per day of brent related production hedged from 2006 to 2012 the average price of these hedge positions is 2620 per barrel there were no natural gas hedges outstanding at december 31 2004 

  production and sales volumes the corporation’s crude oil and natural gas production on a barrel of oil equivalent basis was 342000 barrels per day in 2004 373000 barrels per day in 2003 and 451000 barrels per day in 2002 approximately 50 of the production declines in 2004 and 2003 resulted from sales and exchanges of oil and gas producing properties the remainder resulted principally from natural decline and in 2003 compared with 2002 disappointing results from fields acquired in the united states in 2001 and reduced production from the ceiba field in equatorial guinea the corporation anticipates that its 2005 production including anticipated production from libya will be approximately 350000 barrels of oil equivalent per day see page 27 for the current status of the discussions on the corporation’s return to libya the corporation’s net daily worldwide production was as follows 

  

 20   decreased sales volumes resulted in lower revenue from continuing operations of approximately 75 million in 2004 compared with 2003 and lower revenue of approximately 425 million in 2003 compared with 2002 

  operating costs and exploration expenses operating costs and exploration expenses from continuing operations decreased by approximately 115 million in 2004 compared with 2003 and increased by 70 million in 2003 compared with 2002 depreciation depletion and amortization charges were lower in 2004 and 2003 principally reflecting decreased production volumes exploration expenses were lower in 2004 as a result of lower dry hole costs exploration expenses were higher in 2003 reflecting increased activity in the united states and equatorial guinea as well as additional lease cost amortization production expenses increased in 2004 and 2003 primarily due to the weakening of the us dollar which increased costs incurred in foreign currencies in addition higher selling prices of crude oil and natural gas increased the costs of production taxes transportation maintenance and fuel unit costs per barrel totaled 1726 in 2004 1732 in 2003 and 1511 in 2002 unit cost per barrel includes production expense depreciation depletion and amortization exploration expense and administrative costs

  excluding items in the following table the effective income tax rate for exploration and production operations in 2004 was 46 this includes income taxes paid in jurisdictions with rates in excess of the united states statutory rate such as the united kingdom and norway it also reflects an income tax deduction for the corporation’s hedging results at the us statutory rate each of these factors increases the corporation’s overall exploration and production effective income tax rate the effective income tax rate for exploration and production operations in 2005 is expected to be in the range of 45 to 49 assuming agreements are finalized and the corporation returns to libya the exploration and production effective income tax rate will exceed the range above 

  exploration and production earnings from continuing operations include the following items 

   

21   2004 the corporation recognized gains on the sales of an office building in aberdeen scotland a nonproducing property in malaysia and two mature gulf of mexico properties it also recorded foreign income tax benefits resulting from a change in tax law and a tax settlement the corporation accrued an additional amount for severance and costs for vacated office space during 2004 additional accruals for vacated office space of approximately 35 million before income taxes are anticipated in 2005

  the corporation recorded an income tax benefit reflecting the recognition for united states income tax purposes of certain prior year foreign exploration expenses the gain from asset sale in 2003 reflects the sale of the corporation’s 15 interest in the trans alaska pipeline system 

  2002 exploration and production earnings included aftertax asset impairments of 737 million 530 million of which related to the ceiba field in equatorial guinea the pretax amount of the ceiba field impairment was 706 million the charge resulted from a 12 reduction in the estimated total field reserves that will ultimately be produced from the field as well as higher anticipated development costs needed to produce the remaining reserves at lower production rates over a longer period the reduction in estimated recoverable reserves was attributable to disappointing 2002 yearend drilling results on the western flank of the field the reduction in probable reserves and higher estimated future development costs resulted in an asset impairment because projected cash flows were less than the book value of the field which includes allocated purchase price from the triton acquisition 

  the corporation also recorded an aftertax impairment charge of 207 million to reduce the carrying value of oil and gas properties located primarily in the main pass breton sound area of the gulf of mexico most of these properties were obtained in the 2001 llog acquisition and consisted of producing oil and gas fields with proved and probable reserves and exploration acreage this charge principally reflects reduced reserve estimates on these fields resulting from unfavorable production performance the fair values of producing properties were determined by using discounted cash flows exploration properties were evaluated by using results of drilling and production data from nearby fields and seismic data for these and other properties in the area 

  during 2002 the united kingdom government enacted a 10 supplementary tax on profits from oil and gas production a onetime charge of 43 million was recorded to increase the existing united kingdom deferred tax liability on the balance sheet 

  the gain on asset sales in 2002 reflected the disposal of oil and gas producing properties in the united states united kingdom and azerbaijan and the corporation’s energy marketing business in the united kingdom 

  the corporation’s future exploration and production earnings may be impacted by external factors such as volatility in the selling prices of crude oil and natural gas reserve and production changes and changes in tax rates

22 due primarily to higher refining margins compared with prior years hovensa’s total crude runs amounted to 484000 barrels per day in 2004 440000 barrels per day in 2003 and 361000 barrels per day in 2002 in late 2002 and early 2003 crude oil deliveries to hovensa were interrupted due to political disturbances in venezuela for the remainder of 2003 and in 2004 hovensa received contracted quantities of crude oil from pdvsa the fluid catalytic cracking unit at hovensa operated at 139000 142000 and 116000 barrels per day in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively the coking unit at hovensa commenced production in august 2002 the unit operated at the rate of 55000 barrels per day in 2004 and 53000 barrels per day in 2003 planned maintenance of the fluid catalytic cracking unit at hovensa was completed during the first quarter of 2005 

  earnings from refining and marketing activities also include interest income on the note received from pdvsa at the formation of the joint venture interest on the pdvsa note amounted to 25 million in 2004 30 million in 2003 and 35 million in 2002 interest income is reflected in nonoperating income in the income statement in 2004 the corporation recorded deferred income tax expense of 32 million in refining and marketing results relating to hovensa’s earnings and interest on the pdvsa note in 2005 the corporation expects that deferred income taxes will be recorded at the virgin islands statutory rate of 385 at december 31 2004 the corporation has approximately 190 million of net operating loss carryforwards available to offset its share of future hovensa taxable income 

  retail energy marketing and other retail gasoline operations in 2004 were profitable but less so than in 2003 reflecting lower margins earnings from retail gasoline operations were higher in 2003 compared with 2002 reflecting higher margins energy marketing earnings were lower in 2004 compared with 2003 because of lower margins energy marketing activities had higher earnings in 2003 reflecting increased margins and sales volumes in the early part of the year resulting from the cold winter results of the port reading refining facility improved in 2004 reflecting higher margins than in 2003 which was also an improvement over 2002 results total refined product sales volumes were 428000 barrels per day in 2004 419000 barrels per day in 2003 and 383000 barrels per day in 2002 planned maintenance at the port reading fluid catalytic cracking unit is underway in the first quarter of 2005

  marketing expenses increased in 2004 compared with 2003 reflecting higher expenses from retail operations and the trading partnership 

  refining and marketing earnings include the following items 

 23   

  in 2004 refining and marketing results include income of 12 million from the liquidation of lifo inventories in 2003 refining and marketing earnings were reduced by a loss from the sale of the corporation’s interest in a shipping joint venture in 2002 the corporation completed the sale of six united states flag vessels for 161 million in cash and a note for 29 million the sale resulted in a net gain of 67 million in connection with this sale the corporation agreed to support the buyer’s charter rate on these vessels for up to five years the support agreement requires that if the actual contracted rate for the charter of a vessel is less than the stipulated support rate in the agreement the corporation will pay to the buyer the difference between the contracted rate and the stipulated rate at january 1 2004 the charter support reserve was 32 million during 2004 the corporation made net payments of 4 million for charter support based on contractual longterm charters and estimates of future charter rates the corporation lowered the estimated charter support reserve by 18 million in 2004 the balance in this reserve at december 31 2004 was 10 million in 2002 the corporation recorded a charge for the writeoff of intangible assets in its us energy marketing business in addition severance was recorded for cost reduction initiatives in refining and marketing principally energy marketing

  interest aftertax interest expense in 2004 2003 and 2002 was as follows 

  

  interest incurred decreased in 2004 and 2003 reflecting lower average outstanding debt aftertax interest expense in 2005 is anticipated to be lower than the 2004 level because of higher estimated capitalized interest 

  discontinued operations in 2003 the corporation exchanged its crude oil producing properties in colombia acquired in 2001 as part of the triton acquisition plus 10 million in cash for an additional 25 interest in block a18 in the joint development area of malaysia and thailand jda the exchange resulted 

24 in an aftertax charge to income of 47 million 51 million before income taxes the aftertax loss on this exchange included a 43 million adjustment of the book value of the colombian assets to fair value the loss also included 17 million from the recognition in earnings of the value of related hedge contracts at the time of the exchange these items were partially offset by aftertax earnings in colombia prior to the exchange of 13 million income from discontinued operations of 7 million in 2004 reflects the settlement of a previously accrued contingency relating to the colombian asset exchange 

  in 2003 the corporation also sold gulf of mexico shelf properties the jabung field in indonesia and several small united kingdom fields for 445 million the aftertax gain from these asset sales of 176 million 248 million before income taxes was included in discontinued operations discontinued operations in 2003 also included 40 million of income from operations prior to the sales of these assets

  credit ratings in 2004 two credit rating agencies downgraded their ratings of the corporation’s debt one of the revised ratings was below investment grade if another rating agency were to reduce its credit rating below investment grade the corporation would have to comply with a more stringent financial covenant contained in its revolving credit facility in addition the incremental margin requirements with hedging and trading counterparties at december 31 2004 would be approximately 23 million 

  contractual obligations and contingencies following is a table showing aggregated information about certain contractual obligations at december 31 2004 

  

 27   in the preceding table the corporation’s supply commitments include its estimated purchases of 50 of hovensa’s production of refined products after anticipated sales by hovensa to unaffiliated parties also included are normal term purchase agreements at market prices for additional gasoline necessary to supply the corporation’s retail marketing system and feedstocks for the port reading refining facility in addition the corporation has commitments to purchase natural gas for use in supplying contracted customers in its energy marketing business these commitments were computed based on yearend market prices 

  the table also reflects that portion of the corporation’s planned capital expenditures that are contractually committed at december 31 the corporation’s 2005 capital expenditures are estimated to be approximately 21 billion obligations for operating expenses include commitments for transportation seismic purchases oil and gas production expenses and other normal business expenses other longterm liabilities reflect contractually committed obligations on the balance sheet at december 31 including minimum pension plan funding requirements 

  in connection with the sale of six vessels in 2002 the corporation agreed to support the buyer’s charter rate on these vessels for up to five years the support agreement requires that if the actual contracted rate for the charter of a vessel is less than the stipulated support rate in the agreement the corporation will pay to the buyer the difference between the contracted rate and the stipulated rate the balance in the charter support reserve at december 31 2004 was 10 million 

  the corporation has a contingent purchase obligation to acquire the remaining 50 interest in a retail marketing and gasoline station joint venture for approximately 90 million 

  the corporation guarantees the payment of up to 50 of hovensa’s crude oil purchases from suppliers other than pdvsa the amount of the corporation’s guarantee fluctuates based on the volume of crude oil purchased and related prices and at december 31 2004 amounted to 97 million in addition the corporation has agreed to provide funding up to a maximum of 40 million to the extent hovensa does not have funds to meet its senior debt obligations

  see also “contractual obligations and contingencies” above note 5 “refining joint venture” and note 16 “guarantees and contingencies” in the financial statements 

28   foreign operations the corporation conducts exploration and production activities in many foreign countries including the united kingdom norway denmark gabon indonesia thailand azerbaijan algeria malaysia and equatorial guinea therefore the corporation is subject to the risks associated with foreign operations these exposures include political risk including tax law changes and currency risk the effects of these events are accounted for when they occur and generally have not been material to the corporation’s liquidity or financial position 

  hovensa llc owned 50 by the corporation and 50 by petroleos de venezuela sa pdvsa owns and operates a refinery in the virgin islands although there have in the past been political disruptions in venezuela that reduced the availability of venezuelan crude oil used in refining operations these disruptions did not have a material adverse effect on the corporation’s financial position the corporation also has a note receivable of 273 million at december 31 2004 from a subsidiary of pdvsa the corporation anticipates collection of the remaining balance 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  accounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of assets and liabilities on the corporation’s balance sheet and revenues and expenses on the income statement the accounting methods used can affect net income stockholders’ equity and various financial statement ratios however the corporation’s accounting policies generally do not change cash flows or liquidity 

  accounting for exploration and development costs oil and gas exploration and production activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage including lease bonuses brokers’ fees and other related costs are capitalized annual lease rentals exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred costs of drilling and equipping productive wells including development dry holes and related production facilities are capitalized 

  the costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found in an area requiring a major capital expenditure before production can begin an exploration well is carried as an asset if sufficient reserves are discovered to justify its completion as a production well and additional exploration drilling is underway or firmly planned the corporation does not capitalize the cost of other exploratory wells for more than one year unless proved reserves are found 

  crude oil and natural gas reserves the determination of estimated proved reserves is a significant element in arriving at the results of operations of exploration and production activities the estimates of proved reserves affect well capitalizations undeveloped leasehold impairments and the unit of production depreciation rates of proved properties wells and equipment reductions in reserve estimates may result in the need for increased depreciation or impairments of proved properties and related assets 

  the corporation’s oil and gas reserves are calculated in accordance with sec regulations and interpretations and the requirements of the financial accounting standards board for reserves to be booked as proved they must be commercially producible government approvals must be obtained and depending on the amount of the project cost senior management or the board of directors must commit to fund the project the corporation’s oil and gas reserve estimation and reporting process involves an annual independent third party reserve determination as well as internal technical appraisals of reserves the corporation maintains its own internal reserve estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work directly with the oil and gas properties the corporation’s technical staff updates reserve estimates throughout the year based on evaluations of new wells performance reviews new technical data and other studies to provide consistency throughout the corporation standard reserve estimation guidelines definitions reporting reviews and approval practices are used the internal reserve estimates are subject to internal technical audits and senior management reviews the estimates 

  the oil and gas reserve estimates reported in the supplementary oil and gas data in accordance with fas no 69 are determined independently by the consulting firm of degolyer and macnaughton dm and are consistent with internal estimates annually the corporation provides dm with engineering geological and geophysical data actual production histories and other information necessary for the reserve 

29 determination the corporation’s and dm’s technical staffs meet to review and discuss the information provided senior management and the board of directors review the final reserve estimates issued by dm 

  impairment of longlived assets and goodwill as explained below there are significant differences in the way longlived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing the corporation reviews longlived assets including oil and gas fields for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered longlived assets are tested at the lowest level for which cash flows are identifiable and are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities if the carrying amounts of the longlived assets are not expected to be recovered by undiscounted future net cash flow estimates the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded the amount of impairment is based on the estimated fair value of the assets determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows 

  in the case of oil and gas fields the present value of future net cash flows is based on management’s best estimate of future prices which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices applied to projected production volumes of individual fields and discounted at a rate commensurate with the risks involved the projected production volumes represent reserves including probable reserves expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures the production volumes prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairments will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows since the standardized measure requires the use of actual prices on the last day of the year 

  the corporation’s impairment tests of longlived exploration and production producing assets are based on its best estimates of future production volumes including recovery factors selling prices operating and capital costs and the timing of future production which are updated each time an impairment test is performed in 2002 the corporation recorded impairments of the ceiba field and llog properties that were required primarily because of reduced estimates of oil and gas production volumes and in the case of ceiba anticipated additional development costs the impairment charges did not result from changes in the other factors the change in the estimated timing of production on the ceiba field did not significantly affect the undiscounted future cash flows but did significantly reduce the fair value of the field determined by discounted cash flows the corporation could have additional impairments if the projected production volumes from oil and gas fields were reduced significant extended declines in crude oil and natural gas selling prices could also result in asset impairments 

  the corporation recorded 977 million of goodwill in connection with the purchase of triton energy limited in 2001 factors contributing to the recognition of goodwill included the strategic value of expanding global operations to access new growth areas outside of the united states and the north sea obtaining critical mass in africa and southeast asia and synergies including cost savings improved processes and portfolio high grading opportunities in accordance with fas no 142 goodwill is no longer amortized but must be tested for impairment annually fas no 142 requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at a reporting unit level the reporting unit or units used to evaluate and measure goodwill for impairment are determined primarily from the manner in which the business is managed a reporting unit is an operating segment or a component that is one level below an operating segment a component is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component however two or more components of an operating segment shall be aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics an operating segment shall be deemed a reporting unit if all of its components are economically similar 

  within the corporation’s exploration and production operating segment there are currently two components 1 americas and west africa and 2 europe north africa and asia each component has a manager who reports to the segment manager the corporation has determined the components have similar economic characteristics and therefore has aggregated the components into a single reporting unit — the exploration and production operating segment as a result goodwill has been assigned to the exploration and production operating segment if the corporation reorganized its exploration and production business such 

30 that there was more than one operating segment or its components were no longer economically similar goodwill would be assigned to two or more reporting units the goodwill would be allocated to any new reporting units using a relative fair value approach in accordance with fas no 142 goodwill impairment testing for lower level reporting units could result in the recognition of an impairment that would not otherwise be recognized at the current higher level of aggregation 

  the corporation expects that the benefits of goodwill will be recovered through the operation of the exploration and production segment as a whole and it evaluated the following characteristics in determining that the components are economically similar 

   the corporation’s fair value estimate of the exploration and production segment is the sum of 1 the discounted anticipated cash flows of producing assets and known developments 2 the expected risked present value of exploration assets and 3 an estimated market premium to reflect the market price an acquirer would pay for potential synergies including cost savings access to new business opportunities enterprise control improved processes and increased market share the corporation also considers the relative market valuation of similar exploration and production companies 

  the determination of the fair value of the exploration and production operating segment depends on estimates about oil and gas reserves future prices timing of future net cash flows and market premiums significant extended declines in crude oil and natural gas prices or reduced reserve estimates could lead to a decrease in the fair value of the exploration and production operating segment that could result in an impairment of goodwill in addition changes in management structure or sales or dispositions of a portion of the exploration and production segment may result in goodwill impairment 

  because there are significant differences in the way longlived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing there may be impairments of individual assets that would not cause an impairment of the 977 million of goodwill assigned to the exploration and production segment in 2002 the corporation recognized asset impairments because reduced estimates of oil and gas production volumes caused the expected undiscounted cash flows of the assets to be lower than the asset carrying amounts no impairment of goodwill existed because the fair value of the overall exploration and production operating segment continued to exceed its recorded book value 

  segments the corporation has two operating segments exploration and production and refining and marketing management has determined that these are its operating segments because in accordance with fas no 131 these are the segments of the corporation i that engage in business activities from which revenues are earned and expenses are incurred ii whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the corporation’s chief operating decision maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance and iii for which discrete financial information is available the chairman of the board and chief executive officer of the corporation is the chief operating decision maker codm as defined in fas no 131 because he is responsible for performing the functions within the corporation of allocating resources to and assessing the performance of the corporation’s operating segments the codm uses only the operating results of each segment as a whole to make decisions about resources to be allocated to each segment and to assess the segment performance the codm manages each segment globally and does not regularly review the operating results of any component eg geographic area or asset within each 

31 segment or any such information by geographical location oil and gas property or project subsidiary or division to make decisions about resources to be allocated or to assess performance while the codm does review and approve initial corporate funding for a new project using information about the project he does not review subsequent operating results by project after the initial funding each operating segment has one manager the segment managers are responsible for allocating resources within the segments reviewing financial results of components within the segments and assessing the performance of the components the codm evaluates the performance of the segment managers based on performance metrics related to each manager’s operating segment as a whole the board of directors of the corporation does not receive more detailed information than that used by the codm to operate and manage the corporation 

  hedging the corporation may use futures forwards options and swaps individually or in combination to reduce the effects of fluctuations in crude oil natural gas and refined product selling prices related hedge gains or losses are an integral part of the selling or purchase prices generally these derivatives are designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions cash flow hedges and the changes in fair value are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income these transactions meet the requirements for hedge accounting including correlation the corporation reclassifies hedging gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings at the time the hedged transactions are recognized the ineffective portion of hedges is included in current earnings the corporation’s remaining derivatives including foreign currency contracts are not designated as hedges and the change in fair value is included in income currently at december 31 2004 the corporation has 875 million of deferred exploration and production hedging losses after income taxes included in accumulated other comprehensive income 

  income taxes judgments are required in the determination and recognition of income tax assets and liabilities in the financial statements the corporation has net operating loss carryforwards in several jurisdictions including the united states and has recorded deferred tax assets for those losses additionally the corporation has deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that will be realized in evaluating realizability of deferred tax assets the corporation refers to the reversal periods for temporary differences available carryforward periods for net operating losses estimates of future taxable income the availability of tax planning strategies the existence of appreciated assets and other factors estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas reserves and selling prices that are consistent with the corporation’s internal business forecasts 

environment health and safety 

  the corporation has implemented a valuesbased sociallyresponsible strategy focused on improving environment health and safety performance and making a positive impact on communities the strategy is supported by the corporation’s environment health safety and social responsibility policies and by environment and safety management systems that help protect the corporation’s workforce customers and local communities the corporation’s management systems are based on international standards and are intended to promote internal consistency adherence to policy objectives and continual improvement in ehs performance improved performance may increase the corporation’s operating costs and could also require increased capital expenditures to reduce potential risks to assets reputation and license to operate while overall governance is the responsibility of senior management the corporation has programs in place to evaluate regulatory compliance audit facilities train employees and to generally meet corporate ehs goals 

  the port reading refining facility and the hovensa refinery manufacture conventional and reformulated gasolines that are cleaner burning than that required under current us regulations the production of motor and other fuels in the united states and elsewhere has faced increasing regulatory pressures to reduce sulfur content in recent years in 2004 new regulations went into effect that significantly reduced gasoline sulfur content and additional rules to reduce the allowable sulfur content in diesel fuel will go into effect in 2006 fuels production will likely continue to be subject to more stringent regulation in future years and as such may require additional large capital expenditures 

32   the corporation and hovensa continue to evaluate options to determine the most cost effective compliance strategies for known fuel regulations estimated capital expenditures necessary to comply with lowsulfur gasoline requirements at port reading are approximately 70 million over the next two years capital expenditures to comply with lowsulfur gasoline and diesel fuel requirements at hovensa are presently expected to be approximately 400 million in total 50 million of which has already been spent remaining capital expenditures are projected to be 350 million over the next two years hovensa plans to finance these capital expenditures through cash flow from operations if it becomes necessary to finance a portion of the capital expenditures hovensa has 400 million of available revolving credit capacity 

  federal legislation to restrict or ban the use of mtbe a gasoline oxygenate and to require the use of ‘renewable’ fuels was considered by the united states congress in 2004 and will likely be reconsidered in 2005 the corporation and hovensa both manufacture and use mtbe where permitted to meet the federal requirement for oxygen in reformulated gasoline in states within the corporation’s marketing area where mtbe bans have been enacted such as connecticut and new york the corporation markets reformulated gasoline without oxygenates and ethanol is added to the gasoline downstream from the refineries to meet regulatory requirements if congress bans mtbe nationally or if additional state bans take effect or if an obligation to use ethanol or other renewable fuels is imposed the effect on the corporation and hovensa could be significant whether the effect is significant will depend on several factors including the extent and timing of any such bans of mtbe or obligations to use ethanol requirements for maintenance of certain air emission reductions if mtbe is banned the cost and availability of alternative oxygenates or credits and whether the minimum oxygen content standard for reformulated gasoline remains in effect the corporation will continue to review various options to market and produce reformulated gasolines if additional mtbe bans take effect 

  as described in item 3 “legal proceedings” in 2003 the corporation and hovensa began discussions with the us epa regarding the epa’s petroleum refining initiative pri the pri is an ongoing program that is designed to reduce certain air emissions at all us refineries since 2000 epa has entered into settlements addressing these emissions with petroleum refining companies that control over 50 of the nation’s refining capacity in 26 states and negotiations continue with many refiners depending on the outcome of these discussions the corporation and hovensa may experience increased capital and operating expenses related to air emissions controls the pri allows for controls to be phased in over several years 

  the corporation recognizes the worldwide concern about the environmental and social impact of air emissions on a global scale climate change is an issue that has prompted much public debate and has a potential impact on future economic growth and development the corporation has undertaken a program to assess monitor and reduce the emission of “greenhouse gases” including carbon dioxide and methane the challenges associated with this program may be significant not only from the standpoint of technical feasibility but also from the perspective of adequately measuring the corporation’s entire greenhouse gas inventory 

  the corporation expects continuing expenditures for environmental assessment and remediation related primarily to existing conditions sites where corrective action may be necessary include gasoline stations terminals onshore exploration and production facilities refineries including solid waste management units under permits issued pursuant to the resource conservation and recovery act and although not currently significant “superfund” sites where the corporation has been named a potentially responsible party 

  the corporation accrues for environmental assessment and remediation expenses when the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable at yearend 2004 the corporation’s reserve for its estimated environmental liability was approximately 81 million the corporation does not discount its environmental liability the corporation expects that existing reserves for environmental liabilities will adequately cover costs to assess and remediate known sites remediation spending was 12 million in 2004 and 2003 and 9 million in 2002 capital expenditures for facilities primarily to comply with federal state and local environmental standards were 1 million in 2004 7 million in 2003 and 5 million in 2002

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend   in the normal course of its business the corporation is exposed to commodity risks related to changes in the price of crude oil natural gas refined products and electricity as well as to changes in interest rates and foreign currency values in the disclosures that follow these operations are referred to as nontrading activities the corporation also has trading operations principally through a 50 voting interest in a trading partnership these activities are also exposed to commodity risks primarily related to the prices of crude oil natural gas and refined products the following describes how these risks are controlled and managed 

  controls the corporation maintains a control environment under the direction of its chief risk officer and through its corporate risk policy which the corporation’s senior management has approved controls include volumetric term and valueatrisk limits in addition the chief risk officer must approve the use of new instruments or commodities risk limits are monitored daily and exceptions are reported to business units and to senior management the corporation’s risk management department also performs independent verifications of sources of fair values and validations of valuation models these controls apply to all of the corporation’s nontrading and trading activities including the consolidated trading partnership the corporation’s treasury department administers foreign exchange rate and interest rate hedging programs 

  instruments the corporation primarily uses forward commodity contracts foreign exchange forward contracts futures swaps options and energy commodity linked securities in its nontrading and trading activities these contracts are widely traded instruments mainly with standardized terms the following describes these instruments and how the corporation uses them 

 34 

   quantitative measures the corporation uses valueatrisk to monitor and control commodity risk within its trading and nontrading activities the valueatrisk model uses historical simulation and the results represent the potential loss in fair value over one day at a 95 confidence level the model captures both first and second order sensitivities for options the potential change in fair value based on commodity price risk is presented in the nontrading and trading sections below 

  for foreign exchange rate risk the impact of a 10 change in foreign exchange rates on the value of the corporation’s portfolio of foreign currency forward contracts is presented in the nontrading section similarly the impact of a 15 change in interest rates on the fair value of the corporation’s debt is also presented in the nontrading section a 10 change in foreign exchange rates and a 15 change in the rate of interest over one year are considered reasonable possibilities for providing sensitivity disclosures 

  nontrading the corporation’s nontrading activities include hedging of crude oil and natural gas production futures and swaps are used to fix the selling prices of a portion of the corporation’s future production and the related gains or losses are an integral part of the corporation’s selling prices as of december 31 the corporation has open hedge positions equal to 60 of its estimated 2005 worldwide crude oil production the average price for west texas intermediate crude oil wti related open hedge positions is 3306 the average price for brent crude oil related open hedge positions is 3117 approximately 20 of the corporation’s hedges is wti related and the remainder is brent in addition the corporation has approximately 24000 barrels per day of brent related crude oil production hedged from 2006 through 2012 at an average price of 2620 per barrel there were no hedges of natural gas production at year end as market conditions change the corporation may adjust its hedge percentages 

  because the selling price of crude oil has increased during 2004 accumulated other comprehensive income loss at december 31 2004 includes aftertax deferred losses of 875 million 195 million of realized losses and 680 million of unrealized losses related to crude oil contracts used as hedges of exploration and production sales realized losses in accumulated other comprehensive income represent losses on closed contracts that are deferred until the underlying barrels are sold in addition to the impact of the open hedge positions described above approximately 52 million of the realized losses will reduce earnings in the first quarter of 2005 and the remainder will reduce earnings during the balance of 2005 the pretax amount of all deferred hedge losses is reflected in accounts payable and the related income tax benefits are recorded as deferred tax assets on the balance sheet 

  the corporation also markets energy commodities including refined petroleum products natural gas and electricity the corporation uses futures and swaps to fix the purchase prices of commodities to be sold under fixedprice sales contracts 

  the following table summarizes the valueatrisk results of commodity related derivatives that are settled in cash and used in nontrading activities the results may vary from time to time as hedge levels change 

  

35   the increase in the value at risk in 2004 principally reflects additional hedge positions on brent related production for the years 2006 through 2012 

  the corporation uses foreign exchange contracts to reduce its exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates by entering into forward purchase contracts for both the british pound sterling and the danish kroner at december 31 2004 the corporation has 476 million of notional value foreign exchange contracts maturing in 2005 384 million at december 31 2003 the fair value of foreign exchange contracts recorded as assets was 49 million at december 31 2004 40 million at december 31 2003 the change in fair value of the foreign exchange contracts from a 10 change in exchange rates is estimated to be 53 million at december 31 2004 43 million at december 31 2003 

  at december 31 2004 the interest rate on substantially all of the corporation’s debt was fixed and there were no interest rate swaps the corporation’s outstanding debt of 3835 million has a fair value of 4327 million at december 31 2004 debt of 3941 million at december 31 2003 had a fair value of 4440 million a 15 change in the rate of interest would change the fair value of debt by approximately 260 million at december 31 2004 and by approximately 270 million at december 31 2003 

  trading the trading partnership in which the corporation has a 50 voting interest trades energy commodities and derivatives the accounts of the partnership are consolidated with those of the corporation the corporation also takes trading positions for its own account these strategies include proprietary position management and trading to enhance the potential return on assets the information that follows represents 100 of the trading partnership and the corporation’s proprietary trading accounts 

  in trading activities the corporation is exposed to changes in crude oil natural gas and refined product prices primarily in north america and europe trading positions include futures forwards swaps and options in some cases physical purchase and sale contracts are used as trading instruments and are included in the trading results 

  gains or losses from sales of physical products are recorded at the time of sale derivative trading transactions are markedtomarket and are reflected in income currently total realized gains for the year amounted to 79 million the following table provides an assessment of the factors affecting the changes in fair value of trading activities and represents 100 of the trading partnership and other trading activities 

  

  the corporation uses observable market values for determining the fair value of its trading instruments in cases where actively quoted prices are not available other external sources are used which incorporate information about commodity prices in actively quoted markets quoted prices in less active markets and other market fundamental analysis internal estimates are based on internal models incorporating underlying market information such as commodity volatilities and correlations the corporation’s risk management department

  the corporation has a whollyowned subsidiary that provides distributed electricity generating equipment to industrial and commercial customers as an alternative to purchasing electricity from local utilities the corporation also has invested in longterm technology to develop fuel cells for electricity generation through a venture with other parties competition and market conditions   the petroleum industry is highly competitive the corporation encounters competition from numerous companies in each of its activities particularly in acquiring rights to explore for crude oil and natural gas and in the purchasing and marketing of refined products and natural gas many competitors are larger and have substantially greater resources than the corporation the corporation is also in competition with producers and marketers of other forms of energy   the petroleum business involves largescale capital expenditures and risktaking in the search for new oil and gas reserves long lead times are often required from successful exploration to subsequent production operations in the petroleum industry depend on a depleting natural resource the number of areas where it can be expected that hydrocarbons will be discovered in commercial quantities is constantly diminishing and exploration risks are high areas where hydrocarbons may be found are often in remote locations or offshore where exploration and development activities are capital intensive and operating costs are high   the major foreign oil producing countries including members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries “opec” exert considerable influence over the supply and price of crude oil and refined petroleum products their ability or inability to agree on a common policy on rates of production and other matters has a significant impact on oil markets and the corporation the derivatives markets are also important in influencing the selling prices of crude oil natural gas and refined products the corporation cannot predict the extent to which future market conditions may be affected by foreign oil producing countries the derivatives markets or other external influences other items   the corporation’s operations may be affected by federal state local territorial and foreign laws and regulations relating to tax increases and retroactive tax claims expropriation of property cancellation of contract rights and changes in import regulations as well as other political developments the corporation has been affected by certain of these events in various countries in which it operates the corporation markets motor fuels through lesseedealers and wholesalers in certain states where legislation prohibits producers or refiners of crude oil from directly engaging in retail marketing of motor fuels similar legislation has been periodically proposed in the us congress and in various other states the corporation at this time cannot predict the effect of any of the foregoing on its future operations   compliance with various existing environmental and pollution control regulations imposed by federal state and local governments is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the corporation’s earnings and competitive position within the industry the corporation spent 12 million in 2003 for environmental remediation with a comparable amount anticipated for 2004 capital expenditures for facilities primarily to comply with federal state and local environmental standards were 7 million in 2003 and the corporation anticipates approximately 10 million in 2004 regulatory changes already made or anticipated in the united states will alter the composition and emissions characteristics of motor fuels future capital expenditures necessary to comply with these regulations will be substantial the environmental protection agency has adopted rules that limit the amount of sulfur in gasoline and diesel fuel these rules phase in beginning in 2004 capital expenditures necessary to comply with the lowsulfur gasoline requirements at port reading are estimated to be approximately 70 million over the next several years capital expenditures to comply with lowsulfur gasoline and diesel fuel requirements at hovensa are currently expected to be approximately 450 million over the next three years hovensa expects to finance these capital expenditures through cash flow and if necessary future borrowings 6   the number of persons employed by the corporation averaged 11481 in 2003 and 11662 in 2002   additional operating and financial information relating to the

  purported class actions consolidated under the complaint captioned in re amerada hess corporation securities litigation are pending in the united states district court for the district of new jersey against certain executive officers and former executive officers of the registrant alleging that these individuals sold shares of registrant’s common stock in advance of registrant’s acquisition of triton energy limited “triton” in 2001 in violation of federal securities laws in addition derivative actions seeking damages on behalf of the registrant and consolidated under a complaint captioned in re amerada hess derivative action are pending in the superior court of the state of new jersey against certain executive officers and former executive officers of the registrant some of whom are also directors alleging among other things that the 9 officers breached their fiduciary duties by misusing material nonpublic information of the registrant to personally profit from the sale of the registrant’s common stock in connection with the triton acquisition two other purported class actions based in large part on the same factual background were commenced in may and august 2003 and were consolidated under a complaint captioned falk et al v amerada hess corporation et al in the united states district court for the district of new jersey against certain named executive officers certain directors and former directors and certain employees of registrant on behalf of participants in the registrant’s savings and stock bonus plan alleging that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties under the employee retirement income security act resulting in losses to participants in the plan who held shares of the registrant’s common stock the registrant believes that these actions are without merit and is advancing expenses to these individuals in accordance with its bylaws to defend these actions based on current legal and factual circumstances registrant does not believe these actions will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition 

  registrant has been served with a complaint from the new york state department of environmental conservation “dec” relating to alleged violations at its petroleum terminal in brooklyn new york the complaint which seeks an order to shut down the terminal and penalties in unspecified amounts alleges violations involving the structural integrity of certain tanks the erosion of shorelines and bulkheads petroleum discharges and improper certification of tank repairs dec is also seeking relief relating to remediation of certain gasoline stations in the new york metropolitan area registrant believes that many of the allegations are factually inaccurate or based on an incorrect interpretation of applicable law registrant has already undertaken efforts to address certain conditions discussed in the complaint registrant intends to vigorously contest the complaint but is involved in settlement discussions with dec   over the last five years many refiners have entered into consent agreements to resolve epa’s assertions that refining facilities were modified or expanded without complying with new source review regulations that require permits and new emission controls in certain circumstances and other regulations which impose emissions control requirements these consent agreements which arise out of an epa enforcement initiative focusing on petroleum refiners and utilities have typically imposed substantial civil fines and penalties and required significant capital expenditures to install emissions control equipment epa contacted registrant and hovensa llc hovensa its 50 owned joint venture with petroleos de venezuela regarding the petroleum refinery initiative in august 2003 and held an initial meeting in october 2003 while epa has not made any specific assertions that the registrant or hovensa violated the new source review regulations the registrant and hovensa expect to have further discussions with epa regarding the petroleum refining initiative   in june 2001 the corporation voluntarily investigated and disclosed to the new jersey department of environmental protection njdep that there was a calculation error in the program code of the port reading refining facility’s wet gas scrubber wgs continuous emissions monitoring system cems the error in the code resulted in the cem system under calculating co nox and so 2 emissions from the wgs beginning in late 1998 and some exceedances of the permit limits for nox after discovery the code error was promptly corrected in november 2003 the corporation received a notice of violation from the njdep relating to the cem coding error which proposes a fine of 649600 the corporation is engaging in settlement discussions with njdep to resolve this matter particularly as regards to a reduction in the penalty to reflect the voluntary self disclosure of issue   the registrant along with other companies engaged in refining and marketing of gasoline has been a party to lawsuits and claims related to the use of the methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe in gasoline a series of substantially identical lawsuits many involving water utilities or governmental entities have been recently filed in jurisdictions across the united states against producers of mtbe and petroleum refiners who produce gasoline containing mtbe including registrant the principal allegation is that gasoline containing mtbe is a defective product and that these parties are strictly liable in proportion to their share of the gasoline market for damage to groundwater resources and are required to take remedial action to ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of releases of mtbe additional property damage and personal injury lawsuits and claims related to the use of mtbe are expected prior class action product liability based litigation involving mtbe in gasoline has been resolved without a material effect on the registrant while the damages claimed in these 10 actions are substantial registrant has no reason to believe based on factual and legal circumstances currently known to the registrant that these actions will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition however these actions are in their preliminary stages and the factual and legal circumstances may change 

  in april 2003 hovensa received a notice of violation from the virgin islands department of planning and natural resources “dpnr” relating to certain alleged wastewater permit exceedances occurring in 2001 and 2002 at hovensa the notice proposes a fine of 219000 and requires corrective actions to address the alleged violations hovensa is engaging in settlement discussions with dpnr to resolve this matter   the registrant periodically receives notices from epa that it is a “potential responsible party” under the superfund legislation with respect to various waste disposal sites under this legislation all potentially responsible parties are jointly and severally liable for certain sites epa’s claims or assertions of liability against the corporation relating to these sites have not been fully developed with respect to the remaining sites epa’s claims have been settled or a proposed settlement is under consideration in all cases for amounts which are not material the ultimate impact of these proceedings and of any related proceedings by private parties on the business or accounts of the corporation cannot be predicted at this time due to the large number of other potentially responsible parties and the speculative nature of cleanup cost estimates but is not expected to be material   registrant is one of approximately 40 companies that have received a directive from the new jersey department of environmental protection to remediate contamination in the sediments of the lower passaic river and njdep is also seeking natural resource damages the directive insofar as it affects registrant relates to alleged releases from a petroleum bulk storage terminal in newark new jersey now owned by registrant epa has also issued an order relating to the same contamination but has not named registrant the costs of remediation of the passaic river are preliminary but njdep has estimated them at approximately 900 million based on currently known facts and circumstances registrant does not believe that this matter will result in material liability because its terminal could not have contributed contamination along most of the river’s length and did not store or use contaminants which are of the greatest concern in the river sediments and because there are numerous other parties who will likely share in the cost of remediation and damages   the corporation is from time to time involved in other judicial and administrative proceedings including proceedings relating to other environmental matters although the ultimate outcome of these proceedings cannot be ascertained at this time and some of them may be resolved adversely to the corporation no such proceeding is required to be disclosed under applicable rules of the securities and exchange commission in management’s opinion based upon currently known facts and circumstances such proceedings in the aggregate will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the corporation

corporation purchased the balance from others under shortterm supply contracts and by spot purchases from various sources 5 competition and market conditions   the petroleum industry is highly competitive the corporation encounters competition from numerous companies in each of its activities particularly in acquiring rights to explore for crude oil and natural gas and in the purchasing and marketing of refined products and natural gas many competitors are larger and have substantially greater resources than the corporation the corporation is also in competition with producers and marketers of other forms of energy   the petroleum business involves largescale capital expenditures and risktaking in the search for new oil and gas reserves long lead times are often required from successful exploration to subsequent production operations in the petroleum industry depend on a depleting natural resource the number of areas where it can be expected that hydrocarbons will be discovered in commercial quantities is constantly diminishing and exploration risks are high areas where hydrocarbons may be found are often in remote locations or offshore where exploration and development activities are capital intensive and operating costs are high   the major foreign oil producing countries including members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries “opec” exert considerable influence over the supply and price of crude oil and refined petroleum products their ability or inability to agree on a common policy on rates of production and other matters has a significant impact on oil markets and the corporation the derivatives markets are also important in influencing the selling prices of crude oil natural gas and refined products the corporation cannot predict the extent to which future market conditions may be affected by foreign oil producing countries the derivatives markets or other external influences other items   the corporation’s operations may be affected by federal state local territorial and foreign laws and regulations relating to tax increases and retroactive tax claims expropriation of property cancellation of contract rights and changes in import regulations as well as other political developments the corporation has been affected by certain of these events in various countries in which it operates the corporation markets motor fuels through lesseedealers and wholesalers in certain states where legislation prohibits producers or refiners of crude oil from directly engaging in retail marketing of motor fuels similar legislation has been periodically proposed in the us congress and in various other states the corporation at this time cannot predict the effect of any of the foregoing on its future operations   compliance with various environmental and pollution control regulations imposed by federal state and local governments is not expected to have a materially adverse effect on the corporation’s earnings and competitive position within the industry the corporation spent 9 million in 2002 for environmental remediation with a comparable amount anticipated for 2003 capital expenditures for facilities primarily to comply with federal state and local environmental standards were 5 million in 2002 and the corporation anticipates 15 million in 2003 regulatory changes already made or anticipated in the united states will alter the composition and emissions characteristics of motor fuels future capital expenditures necessary to comply with these regulations will be substantial the environmental protection agency has adopted rules that limit the amount of sulfur in gasoline and diesel fuel these rules phase in beginning in 2004 capital expenditures necessary to comply with the lowsulfur gasoline requirements at port reading are expected to be approximately 70 million over the next four years capital expenditures to comply with lowsulfur gasoline and diesel fuel requirements at

corporation purchased the balance from others under shortterm supply contracts and by spot purchases from various sources competition and market conditions   the petroleum industry is highly competitive the corporation encounters competition from numerous companies in each of its activities particularly in acquiring rights to explore for crude oil and natural gas and in the purchasing and marketing of refined products and natural gas many competitors are larger and have substantially greater resources than the corporation the corporation is also in competition with producers and marketers of other forms of energy   the petroleum business involves largescale capital expenditures and risktaking in the search for new oil and gas reserves long lead times are often required from successful exploration to subsequent production operations in the petroleum industry depend on a depleting natural resource the number of areas where it can be expected that hydrocarbons will be discovered in commercial quantities is constantly diminishing and exploration risks are high areas where hydrocarbons may be found are often in remote locations or offshore where exploration and development activities are capital intensive and operating costs are high   the major foreign oil producing countries including members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries “opec” exert considerable influence over the supply and price of crude oil and refined petroleum products their ability or inability to agree on a common policy on rates of production and other matters has a significant impact on oil markets and the corporation the derivatives markets are also important in influencing the selling prices of crude oil natural gas and refined products the corporation cannot predict the extent to which future market conditions may be affected by foreign oil producing countries the derivatives markets or other external influences other items   the corporation’s operations may be affected by federal state local territorial and foreign laws and regulations relating to tax increases and retroactive tax claims expropriation of property cancellation of contract rights and changes in import regulations as well as other political developments the corporation has been affected by certain of these events in various countries in which it operates the corporation markets motor fuels through lesseedealers and wholesalers in certain states where legislation prohibits producers or refiners of crude oil from directly engaging in retail marketing of motor fuels similar legislation has been periodically proposed in the us congress and in various other states the corporation at this time cannot predict the effect of any of the foregoing on its future operations   compliance with various environmental and pollution control regulations imposed by federal state and local governments is not expected to have a materially adverse effect on the corporation’s earnings and competitive position within the industry the corporation spent 8 million in 2001 for environmental remediation with a comparable amount anticipated for 2002 capital expenditures for facilities primarily to comply with federal state and local environmental standards were 6 million in 2001 and the corporation anticipates 12 million in 2002 regulatory changes already made or anticipated in the united states will alter the composition and emissions characteristics of motor fuels future capital expenditures necessary to comply with these regulations may be substantial the environmental protection agency has adopted rules that limit the amount of sulfur in gasoline and diesel fuel these rules phase in beginning in 2004 capital expenditures necessary to comply with the lowsulfur gasoline requirements at port reading are expected to be approximately 70 million over the next three years capital expenditures to comply with lowsulfur gasoline and diesel fuel requirements at hovensa are currently expected to be 460 million over the next four years hovensa expects to finance these capital expenditures through cash flow and if necessary future borrowings   the number of

wastes under the resource conservation and recovery act and ii nonreporting or misreporting of the results of wastewater discharge samples required to be obtained by the corpus christi wastewater discharge permit the registrant settled all civil liabilities to tnrcc that might have attached as a result of the alleged discharge of hydrocarbons and certain specified waste disposal and wastewater discharge allegations investigations by the united states relating to waste disposal practices and wastewater discharge reporting at corpus christi may be continuing it is not possible at this time for registrant to state whether any additional proceedings arising out of the investigations will be commenced against the registrant or what claims would be asserted or what relief would be sought   the registrant investigated and disclosed to tnrcc allegations made to the registrant’s internal reporting hotline of noncompliance at the galena park texas terminal formerly owned by registrant with state environmental regulations the registrant’s investigation focused on whether i the vapor control system at galena park met applicable regulatory requirements during loading of marine vessels and

payment of a fine of 47600 on september 22 2000 on december 22 2000 tnrcc issued a proposed order assessing a civil fine of 103125 relating to control of emissions from loading of marine vessels on march 5 2001 registrant entered into an agreed order with the tnrcc agreeing to pay this fine to resolve this matter   registrant has been served with a complaint from the new york state department of environmental conservation “dec” relating to alleged violations at its petroleum terminal in brooklyn new york the complaint which seeks an order to shut down the terminal and penalties in unspecified

proposed administrative penalty of 272250 relating to exceedances of hourly limits for so 2 emissions at its seminole gas processing plant in seminole texas registrant believes that such exceedances

competition and market conditions

     the petroleum industry is highly competitive the corporation encounters
competition from numerous companies in each of its activities particularly in
acquiring rights to explore for crude oil and natural gas and in the purchasing
and marketing of refined products many competitors are larger and have
substantially greater resources than the corporation the corporation is also in
competition with producers and marketers of other forms of energy

     the petroleum business involves largescale capital expenditures and
risktaking in the search for new oil and gas reserves long lead times are
often required from successful exploration to subsequent production operations
in the petroleum industry depend on a depleting natural resource the number of
areas where it can be expected that hydrocarbons will be discovered in
commercial quantities is constantly diminishing and exploration risks are high
areas where hydrocarbons may be found are often in remote locations or offshore
where exploration and development activities are capital intensive and operating
costs are high

     the major foreign oil producing countries including members of the
organization of petroleum exporting countries opec exert considerable
influence over the supply and price of crude oil and refined petroleum products
their ability or inability to agree on a common policy on rates of production
and other matters has a significant impact on oil markets and the corporation
the derivatives markets are also important in influencing the selling prices of
crude oil natural gas and refined products the corporation cannot predict the
extent to which future market conditions may be affected by foreign oil
producing countries the derivatives markets or other external influences

other items

     the corporations operations may be affected by federal state local
territorial and foreign laws and regulations relating to tax increases and
retroactive tax claims expropriation of property cancellation of contract
rights and changes in import regulations as well as other political
developments the corporation has been affected by certain of these events in
various countries in which it operates the corporation markets motor fuels
through lesseedealers and wholesalers in certain states where legislation
prohibits producers or refiners of crude oil from directly engaging in retail
marketing of motor fuels similar legislation has been periodically proposed in
the us congress and in various other states the corporation at this time
cannot predict the effect of any of the foregoing on its future operations

     compliance with various environmental and pollution control regulations
imposed by federal state and local governments is not expected to have a
materially adverse effect on the corporations earnings and competitive position
within the industry the corporation expended 7 million in 2000 for
environmental

                                        4
page   6

remediation with a comparable amount anticipated for 2001 capital expenditures
for facilities primarily to comply with federal state and local environmental
standards were 5 million in 2000 and the corporation anticipates comparable
capital expenditures in 2001 regulatory changes already made or anticipated in
the united states will alter the composition and emissions characteristics of
motor fuels future capital expenditures necessary to comply with these
regulations may be substantial

     the number of persons employed by the corporation averaged 9891 in 2000
and 8485 in 1999

minimize price and supply risks associated with its united states and united
kingdom natural gas supply commitments by entering into purchase contracts with
third parties having adequate sources of supply on terms substantially similar
to those under its commitments

item 3  legal proceedings

     as reported in registrants annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year
ended december 31 1998 allegations were made to the registrants internal
reporting hotline concerning noncompliance at the corpus christi terminal
formerly owned by registrant with federal and state environmental regulations
and its investigation of this noncompliance these allegations and the
subsequent investigations were voluntarily disclosed to the texas natural
resource conservation commission tnrcc and related to i onsite disposal of
wastes and whether or not such wastes should have been managed as hazardous
wastes under the resource conservation and recovery act and ii nonreporting
or misreporting of the results of wastewater

                                        7
page   9

discharge samples required to be obtained by the corpus christi wastewater
discharge permit the registrant settled all civil liabilities to tnrcc that
might have attached as a result of the alleged discharge of hydrocarbons and
certain specified waste disposal and wastewater discharge allegations
investigations by tnrcc and the united states environmental protection agency
epa relating to waste disposal practices and wastewater discharge reporting
at corpus christi may be continuing it is not possible at this time for
registrant to state whether any additional proceedings arising out of the
investigations will be commenced against the registrant or what claims would be
asserted or what relief would be sought

     the registrant investigated and disclosed to tnrcc allegations made to the
registrants internal reporting hotline of noncompliance at the galena park
texas terminal formerly owned by registrant with state environmental
regulations the registrants investigation focused on whether i the vapor
control system at galena park met applicable regulatory requirements during
loading of marine vessels and ii galena park implemented required controls on
air emissions resulting from tank cleaning operations the registrant settled
all civil liabilities relating to air emissions from tank cleaning by payment of
a fine of 47600 on september 22 2000 on december 22 2000 tnrcc issued a
proposed appeal order assessing a fine of 103125 relating to control of
emissions from loading of marine vessels the registrant and the current owner
of the galena park terminal williams terminals holdings llc are engaging in
discussion with tnrcc and anticipate resolution of this matter

     on february 16 1999 the florida department of environmental protection
fldep mailed the registrant a proposed consent order relating to alleged
violations of the industrial wastewater discharge permit limits for the tampa
florida terminal the consent order proposes a fine of 1060000 the
registrant has previously undertaken a program of corrective measures and other
appropriate responses to these alleged permit violations the registrant is
engaging in discussions with the fldep to resolve this matter and expects that
the amount if any ultimately paid by the registrant will be substantially less
than the proposed fine

     the corporation periodically receives notices from epa that the corporation
is a potentially responsible party under the superfund legislation with
respect to various waste disposal sites under this legislation all potentially
responsible parties are jointly and severally liable for certain sites epas
claims or assertions of liability against the corporation relating to these
sites have not been fully developed with respect to the remaining sites epas
claims have been settled or a proposed settlement is under consideration in
all cases for amounts which are not material the ultimate impact of these
proceedings and of any related proceedings by private parties on the business
or accounts of the corporation cannot be predicted at this time due to the large
number of other potentially responsible parties and the speculative nature of
cleanup cost estimates but is not expected to be material

     the corporation is from time to time involved in other judicial and
administrative proceedings including proceedings relating to other
environmental matters although the ultimate outcome of these proceedings cannot
be ascertained at this time and some of them may be resolved adversely to the
corporation no such proceeding is required to be disclosed under applicable
rules of the securities and exchange commission in managements opinion based
upon currently known facts and circumstances such proceedings in the aggregate
will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the
corporation
