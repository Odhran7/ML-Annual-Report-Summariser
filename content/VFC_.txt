our directtoconsumer business includes vfoperated retail stores brand ecommerce sites concession retail locations and other digital platforms directtoconsumer revenues were 46 of total vf revenues in fiscal 2022 

our fullprice ret ail stores allow us to display a brand’s full line of products with fixtures and imagery that support the brand’s positioning and promise to consumers these experiences provide high visibility for our brands and products and enable us to stay close to the needs and preferences of our consumers the complete and impactful presentation of products in our stores also helps to increase sellthrough of vf products at our wholesale customers due to increased brand awareness education and visibility vfoperated fullprice stores generally provide gross margins that are well above vf averages 

in addition vf operates outlet stores in both premium outlet malls and more traditional valuebased locations these outlet stores carry merchandise that is specifically designed for sale in our outlet stores and serve an important role in our overall inventory management and profitability by allowing vf to sell a significant portion of excess discontinued and outofseason products at better prices than otherwise available from outside parties while maintaining the integrity of our brands

vf corporation fiscal 2022 form 10k 3 

europe and asi a during fiscal 2022 vfoperated retail stores across the globe remained open for the majority of the year however at varying times during the year vf experienced temporary closures in response to the coronavirus covid19 pandemic closures were based on guidance from health advisors and governmental actions and regulation s overall vf operated retail store closures were less significant in fiscal 2022 when compared to fiscal 2021 

ecommerce represented approximately 44 of our directtoconsumer business and 20 of total vf revenues in fiscal 2022 all vf brands are marketed online we continue to expand our ecommerce initiatives by rolling out additional countryspecific brand sites in europe and asia which enhances our ability to deliver a superior localized consumer experience we also continue to increase focus on digital innovation and growth across other thirdparty digital platforms that are reported 

within our directtoconsumer business changes in the retail landscape resulting from the covid19 pandemic has accelerated the growth of our ecommerce platform resulting in levels well above periods prior to covid19 

we expect our directtoconsumer business to continue to gain share in our revenue mix as we accelerate our consumerminded retailcentric hyperdigital business model transformation 

in addition to our directtoconsumer operations independent parties own and operate approximately 2700 partnership stores these are primarily monobrand retail locations selling vf products that have the appearance of vfoperated stores most of these partnership stores are located in europe and in asia and are concentrated amongst the timberland ®  the north face ®  vans ®  dickies ®  kipling ® and napapijri ®   brands 



as part of our strategy of expanding market penetration of vfowned brands we enter into licensing agreements with independent parties for specific apparel and complementary product categories when such arrangements provide more effective sourcing distribution and marketing than could be achieved internally we provide support to these business partners and ensure the integrity of our brand names by taking an active role in the design quality control advertising marketing and distribution of licensed products 

licensing ar rangements relate to a broad range of vf brands and are for fixed terms of generally 3 to 5 years with conditional renewal options outside of certain licensing arrangements for the dickies ® brand that have longer terms each licensee pays royalties to vf based on its sales of licensed products with most agreements providing for a minimum royalty requirement royalties generally range from 4 to 10 of the licensing partners’ net licensed product sales royalty income was 666 million in fiscal 2022 less than 1 of total revenues primarily from the dickies ®  vans ® and timberland ® brands 



product design and innovation including fit fabric finish and quality are important elements across our businesses these functions are performed by employees located in our global supply chain organization and our branded business units across the globe 

vf’s centralized global supply chain organization is responsible for procuring and delivering products to support our brands and businesses vf is highly skilled in managing the complexities associated with our global supply chain  in fiscal 2022 vf sourced approximately 408 million units spread across our brands our products were primarily obtained from approximately 252 independent contractor manufacturing facilities in approximately 37 countries ad ditionally we operate 25 distribution centers and 1322 retail stores managing this complexity is made possible by the use of a network of information systems for product development forecasting order management and warehouse management along with our core enterprise resource management platforms 

products obtained from contractors in the western hemisphere generally have a higher cost than products obtain ed from contractors in asia however contracting in the western hemisphere gives us greater flexibility shorter lead times and allows for lower inventory levels for the us market the use of contracted production with different geographic regions and cost structures provides a flexible approach to product sourcing we will continue to manage our supply chain from a global perspective and adjust as needed to changes in the global production environment 

independent contractors generally own the raw materials and ship finished readyforsale products to vf these contractors are engaged through vf sourcing hubs in singapore with satellite offices across asia and panama these hubs are responsible for managing the procurement of product supplier oversight product quality assurance sustainability within the supply chain responsible sourcing and transportation and shipping functions in addition our hubs leverage proprietary knowledge and technology to enable certain contractors to more effectively control costs and improve labor efficiency 

management continually monitors political risks and developments related to duties tariffs and quotas we limit vf’s sourcing exposure through among other measures i diversifying production among countries and contractors ii sourcing production to merchandise categories where product is readily available and iii sourcing from countries with tariff preference and free trade agreements vf does not directly or indirectly source products from suppliers in countries that are prohibited by the us state department 

no single supplier represented more than 7 of our total cost of goods sold during fiscal 2022 

all independent contractor facilities that manufacture vf products must comply with vf’s global compliance principles these principles consistent with international labor standards are a set of strict standards covering legal and ethical business practices worker age work hours health and safety conditions environmental standards and compliance with local laws and regulations 

4 vf corporation fiscal 2022 form 10k 

vf through its contractor monitoring program audits the activities of the independent businesses and contractors that produce vf products at locations across the globe each of the approximately 252 independent contractor facilities including those serving our independent licensees must be precertified before producing vf products this precertification includes passing a factory inspection and signing a vf terms of engagement agreement we maintain an ongoing audit program to ensure compliance with these requirements by using dedicated internal staff and externally contracted firms additional information about vf’s code of business conduct global compliance principles terms of engagement and environmental compliance guidelines along with a global compliance report is available on the vf website at wwwvfccom 

covid19 has impacted some of vfs suppliers including the resurgence of covid19 lockdowns in key sourcing countries that resulted in additional manufacturing constraints during fiscal 2022 however this situation has improved over time additionally fiscal 2022 was impacted by continued port congestion lengthened transit times equipment availability and other logistics challenges these issues have caused significant product delays which have resulted in challenges to timely meet 

customer demand in fiscal 2022 however vf has actively worked with its suppliers to minimize disruption vf has and will continue to work to offset any increases in product costs through i the continuing shift in the mix of its business to higher margin brands geographies and channels of distribution ii increases in the prices of its products and iii cost reduction efforts the loss of any one supplier or contractor would not have a significant adverse effect on our business 

product is shipped from our independent suppliers to distribution centers around the world in some instances product is shipped directly to our customers most distribution centers are operated by vf and most support more than one brand in response to covid19 vfs distribution centers have maintained operations in accordance with local government guidelines while maintaining enhanced health and safety protocols 

our largest distribution centers by region are located in visalia california prague czech republic and shanghai china in total we operate 25 owned or leased distribution centers primarily in the us but also in the czech republic united kingdom the netherlands china canada mexico belgium israel japan and france 



vf’s quarterly operating results vary due to the seasonality of our individual brands and are historically stronger in the second half of the calendar year this variation results primarily from the seasonal influences on revenues of our outdoor segment where revenues are historically weighted towards the second and third fiscal quarters on a quarterly basis in fiscal 2022 revenues ranged from a low of 19 of full year revenues in the first fiscal quarter to a high of 31 in the third fiscal quarter while operating margin was 9 in the first fiscal quarter and 19 in the third fiscal quarter this variation results primarily from the seasonal influences on revenues of our outdoor segment where 12 of the segments revenues occurred in the first fiscal quarter compared to 36 in the third fiscal quarter of 

fisca l 2022 with changes in our mix of business and the growth of our retail operations historical quarterly revenue and profit trends may not be indicative of future trends 

working capital requirements vary throughout the year working capital typically increases early in the calendar year as inventory builds to support peak shipping periods and then moderates later in the year as those inventories are sold and accounts receivable are collected historically cash provided by operating activities is substantially higher in the second half of the calendar year due to higher net income during that period and reduced working capital requirements particularly during the fourth quarter of the calendar year 



during fiscal 2022 our advertising and promotion expense was 8406 million representing 7 of total revenues we advertise in consumer and trade publications and through digital initiatives including social media and mobile platforms on the internet we also participate in cooperative advertising on a shared cost basis with major retailers in print and digital media radio and television we sponsor sporting musical and special events as well as athletes and personalities who promote our products we employ marketing sciences to optimize the impact of advertising and promotional spending and to identify the types of spending that provide the greatest return on our marketing investments 

we provide advertising support to our wholesale customers including independent partnership stores in the form of pointofsale fixtures and signage to enhance the presentation and brand image of our products we also participate in shopinshops and concession retail arrangements which are separate sales areas dedicated to a specific vf brand within our customers stores and other locations to help differentiate and enhance the presentation of our products 

we contribute to incentive programs with our wholesale customers including cooperative advertising funds discounts and allowances we also offer sales incentive programs directly to consumers in the form of discounts rebates and coupon offers that are eligible for use in certain vfoperated stores brand ecommerce sites and concession retail locations vf also offers loyalty programs for certain brands that provide a range of benefits to consumers 

in addition to sponsorships and activities that directly benefit our products and brands vf and its associates actively support our communities and various charities for example the north face ® brand has committed to programs that encourage and enable outdoor participation such as the north face explore fund™ program the timberland ® brand has a strong heritage of volunteerism including the path of service™ program that offers fulltime employees paid time off to serve their local communities through global service events such as earth day in the spring and servapalooza in the fall in fiscal 2022 the vans ® brand launched checkerboard day the brands single largest philanthropic initiative supporting charities from around the world who share a mission of revitalizing public spaces through arts sports culture and social impact programming

 item 1a risk factors 

tableend

the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating vf’s business and the forwardlooking statements contained in this form 10k any of the following risks could materially adversely affect vf’s business its operating results and its financial condition 



vf’s revenues and profits depend on the level of consumer spending for apparel and footwear which is sensitive to global economic conditions and other factors a decline in consumer spending could have a material adverse effect on vf 

the success of vf’s business depends on consumer spending on apparel and footwear and there are a number of factors that influence consumer spending including actual and perceived economic conditions disposable consumer income interest rates consumer credit availability inflationary pressures such as current inflation related to global supply chain disruptions unemployment stock market performance weather conditions and natural disasters energy prices public health issues including the covid19 pandemic geopolitical instability such as the current conflict between russia and ukraine and related economic and other retaliatory measures taken by the united states european union and others consumer discretionary spending patterns and tax rates in the international national regional and local markets where vf’s products are sold decreased consumer spending could result in reduced demand for our products reduced orders from customers for our products order cancellations lower revenues higher discounts increased inventories and lower gross margins the uncertain state of the global economy continues to impact businesses around the world most acutely in emerging markets and developing economies if global economic and financial market conditions do not improve adverse economic trends or other factors could negatively impact the level of consumer spending which could have a material adverse impact on vf 

the coronavirus covid19 pandemic has and could continue to materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business has been and could continue to be impacted by the effects of the covid19 pandemic in countries and territories where we operate and our employees suppliers thirdparty service providers consumers or customers are located as a result of the covid19 pandemic and in response to government recommendations or mandates as well as decisions we made to protect the health and safety of our employees consumers and communities our operations where our products are made manufactured distributed or sold were temporarily closed or operated with limited operating hours and limited occupancy levels most of our operations have reopened but there continues to be uncertainty around the extent to which operations may be closed again or experience operational restrictions if and where there is a resurgence in covid19 or new variants of the virus emerge and the duration and severity of any related restrictions some of the impacts of the covid19 pandemic on our business have included and could continue to include the following 

• significant reductions in demand and significant volatility in demand for our products by consumers and customers resulting in reduced orders order cancellations lower revenues higher discounts increased inventories decreased value of inventories and lower gross margins which continue to be caused by among other things the 

inability of consumers to purchase our products due to illness quarantine or other restrictions or out of fear of exposure to covid19 phased reopenings and reclosures of our owned stores as well as stores of our customers or reduced store hours across the americas europe and asiapacific regions due to a resurgence of covid19 significant declines in consumer retail store traffic to stores that have reopened or financial hardship and unemployment shifts in demand away from consumer discretionary products and reduced options for marketing and promotion of products or other restrictions in connection with the covid19 pandemic 

• significant uncertainty and turmoil in global economic and financial market conditions causing among other things decreased consumer confidence and decreased consumer spending now and in the mid and longterm inability to access financing in the credit and capital markets including the commercial paper market at reasonable rates or at all in the event we our customers or suppliers find it desirable to do so increased exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar and volatility in the availability and prices for commodities and raw materials we use for our products and in our supply chain 

• inability to meet our consumers’ and customers’ needs for inventory production and fulfillment due to disruptions in our supply chain and increased costs associated with mitigating the effects of the pandemic caused by among other things reduction or loss of workforce due to illness quarantine or other restrictions or facility closures including vaccine mandates or return to work policies scarcity of andor increased prices for raw materials scrutiny or embargoing of goods produced in infected areas capacity constraints vessel container and other transportation shortages and port congestion and increased freight and logistics costs expenses and times failure of third parties on which we rely including our suppliers customers distributors service providers and commercial banks to meet their obligations to us or to timely meet those obligations or significant disruptions in their ability to do so which may be caused by their own financial or operational difficulties including business failure or insolvency and collectability of existing receivables 

• significant changes in the conditions in markets in which we do business including quarantines governmental or regulatory actions closures or other restrictions including voluntarily adopted practices that limit or close operating and manufacturing facilities and restrict our employees’ ability to perform necessary business functions including operations necessary for the design development production distribution sale marketing and support of our products and increase the likelihood of litigation 

• increased costs including increased employee costs such as for expanded benefits and essential employee 

10 vf corporation fiscal 2022 form 10k 

incentives and increased operating costs including those associated with provision of personal protective equipment and compliance with governmental or public health organization mandates or guidance allowances or extended payment terms for customers and inventory writeoffs all of which have negatively impacted our profitability 

• increased risk to the health safety and wellness including mental and emotional health of our employees due to the virus or the impact of related restrictions 

• increased tax risk related to employees working remotely in a tax location other than their normal work location and 

• amplified data security risks as a result of more employees working remotely including increased demand on our information technology resources and systems increased phishing and other cybersecurity attacks and an increase in the number of points of potential attack such as laptops and mobile devices 

these impacts have placed and could continue to place limitations on our ability to execute our business plan and materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations we continue to monitor the situation and may adjust our current policies and procedures as more information and guidance become available the impact of covid19 may also exacerbate other risks discussed in this “risk factors” section any of which could have a material effect on us the extent of the impact of the covid19 pandemic will depend on future developments including the duration severity and any resurgences of covid19 which are uncertain and cannot be predicted 

the apparel and footwear industries are highly competitive and vf’s success depends on its ability to gauge consumer preferences and product trends and to respond to constantly changing markets 

vf competes with numerous apparel and footwear brands and manufacturers competition is generally based upon brand name recognition price design product quality selection service and purchasing convenience some of our competitors are larger and have more resources than vf in some product categories and regions in addition vf competes directly with the private label brands of its wholesale customers vf’s ability to compete within the apparel and footwear industries depends on our ability to 

• anticipate and respond to changing consumer preferences and product trends in a timely manner 

• develop attractive innovative and high quality products that meet consumer needs 

• maintain strong brand recognition 

• price products appropriately 

• provide bestinclass marketing support and intelligence and optimize and react to available consumer data 

• ensure product availability and optimize supply chain efficiencies 

• obtain sufficient retail store space and effectively present our products at retail 

• produce or procure quality products on a consistent basis and 

• adapt to a more digitally driven consumer landscape 

failure to compete effectively or to keep pace with rapidly changing consumer preferences markets technology business model and product trends could have a material adverse effect on vf’s business financial condition and results of operations moreover there are significant shifts underway in the wholesale and retail ecommerce and retail store channels which have been accelerated because of the covid19 pandemic vf may not be able to manage its brands within and across channels sufficiently which could have a material adverse effect on vf’s business financial condition and results of operations 

the retail industry has experienced financial difficulty that could adversely affect vfs business 

recently there have been consolidations reorganizations restructurings bankruptcies and ownership changes in the retail industry in addition the covid19 pandemic has resulted and could continue to result in closed stores and reduced consumer traffic and purchasing these events individually and together could have and in the case of the covid19 pandemic have had a material adverse effect on vfs business these changes could impact vf’s opportunities in the market and increase vf’s reliance on a smaller number of large customers in the future retailers are likely to further consolidate undergo restructurings or reorganizations or bankruptcies realign their affiliations or reposition their stores’ target markets in addition consumers have continued to transition away from traditional wholesale retailers to large online retailers these developments could result in a reduction in the number of stores that carry vf’s products an increase in ownership concentration within the retail industry an increase in credit exposure to vf or an increase in leverage by vf’s customers over their suppliers 

further the global economy periodically experiences recessionary conditions with rising unemployment reduced availability of credit increased savings rates and declines in real estate and securities values these recessionary conditions including as a result of the covid19 pandemic could have a negative impact on retail sales of apparel footwear and other consumer products the lower sales volumes along with the possibility of restrictions on access to the credit markets could result in our customers experiencing financial difficulties including store closures bankruptcies or liquidations this could result in higher credit risk to vf relating to receivables from our customers who are experiencing these financial difficulties if these developments occur our inability to shift sales to other customers or to collect on vf’s trade accounts receivable could have a material adverse effect on vf’s financial condition and results of operations 

vf’s profitability may decline as a result of increasing pressure on margins 

the apparel industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors including intense competition consolidation in the retail industry rising commodity and conversion costs inflation rising freight costs rising labor costs pressure from retailers to reduce the costs of products changes in consumer demand and shifts to online shopping and purchasing customers may increasingly seek markdown allowances incentives and other forms of economic support if these factors cause us to reduce our sales prices to retailers and consumers and we fail to sufficiently reduce our product costs or operating expenses vf’s profitability will decline this could have a material adverse effect on vf’s results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

vf corporation fiscal 2022 form 10k 11 



vf’s business and the success of its products could be harmed if vf is unable to maintain the images of its brands 

vf’s success to date has been due in large part to the growth of its brands’ images and vf’s customers’ connection to its brands if we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to changing consumer demand the names and images of our brands may be impaired even if we react appropriately to changes in consumer preferences consumers may consider our brands’ images to be outdated or associate our brands with styles that are no longer popular in addition brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of qualities including merchandise quality and corporate integrity negative claims or publicity regarding vf its brands or its products including licensed products or its culture and values or its employees endorsers sponsors or suppliers could adversely affect our reputation and sales regardless of whether such claims are accurate the rapidly changing media environment including our increasing reliance on social media and online marketing which accelerates the dissemination of information can increase the challenges of responding to negative claims in addition we have sponsorship contracts with a number of athletes musicians and celebrities and feature those individuals in our advertising and marketing efforts failure to continue to obtain or maintain highquality sponsorships and endorsers could harm our business in addition actions taken by those individuals associated with our products could harm their reputations which could adversely affect the images of our brands our reputation and brand image also could be damaged as a result of our support of association with or lack of support or disapproval of certain social causes as well as any decisions we make to continue to conduct or change certain of our activities in response to such considerations 

vf’s revenues and cash requirements are affected by the seasonal nature of its business 

vf’s business is seasonal with a higher proportion of revenues and operating cash flows generated during the second half of the calendar year which includes the fall and holiday selling seasons poor sales in the second half of the calendar year would have a material adverse effect on vf’s full year operating results and cause higher inventories in addition fluctuations in sales and operating income in any fiscal quarter are affected by the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales 

we may be adversely affected by weather conditions 

our business is adversely affected by unseasonable weather conditions a significant portion of the sales of our products is dependent in part on the weather and is likely to decline in years in which weather conditions do not favor the use of these products for example periods of unseasonably warm weather in the fall or winter can lead to reduced consumer spending that negatively impacts vfs directtoconsumer business and inventory accumulation by our wholesale customers which can in turn negatively affect orders in future seasons in addition abnormally harsh or inclement weather can also negatively impact retail traffic and consumer spending any and all of these risks may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

vf may not succeed in its business strategy 

one of vf’s key strategic objectives is growth we seek to grow organically and through acquisitions we seek to grow by building our lifestyle brands expanding our share with winning customers stretching vf’s brands to new regions leveraging our supply chain and information technology capabilities across vf and expanding our directtoconsumer business including opening new stores remodeling and expanding our existing stores and growing our ecommerce business however we may not be able to grow our business for example 

• we may have difficulty completing acquisitions or dispositions to reshape our portfolio and we may not be able to successfully integrate a newly acquired business or achieve the expected growth cost savings or synergies from such integration or it may disrupt our current business 

• we may not be able to transform our model to be more consumer and retailcentric 

• we may not be able to transform our model to be more digitally focused 

• we may not be able to expand our market share with winning customers or our wholesale customers may encounter financial difficulties and thus reduce their purchases of vf products 

• we may not be able to successfully distort investments to asia or meet evolving consumer needs to unlock growth opportunities for our brands or expand in other geographies 

• we may not be able to effectively deploy resources and allocate capital towards investments in new and organic businesses and capabilities in order to drive strategic objectives 

• we may not be able to achieve the expected results from our supply chain initiatives and establish and maintain effective supply chain systems data and capabilities infrastructure and the sourcing strategy necessary to optimally meet current and future business needs 

• we may have difficulty recruiting developing or retaining qualified employees 

• we may not be able to achieve our directtoconsumer expansion goals including in ecommerce or other new channels manage our growth effectively successfully integrate the planned new stores into our operations operate our new remodeled and expanded stores profitably adapt our business model or develop relationships with consumers for ecommerce or other new channels 

• we may not be able to offset rising commodity or conversion costs in our product costs with pricing actions or efficiency improvements 

failure to implement our strategic objectives may have a material adverse effect on vf’s business 

moreover vf is engaged in a business model transformation to become more consumerminded retailcentric and hyperdigital failure to successfully execute vf’s transformation agenda at a fast enough pace with clear objectives assignments accountability project management governance and 

12 vf corporation fiscal 2022 form 10k 

appropriate consideration for change management could result in a diminished ability to remain competitive 

further organizational effectiveness agility and execution are important to vf’s success failure to create an agile and efficient operating model and organizational structure or to effectively define prioritize and align on clear achievable and appropriately resourced strategic priorities could result in an inability to remain competitive in a rapidly changing marketplace and lead to increase in costs inefficient resource allocation reduced productivity organizational confusion and reduced employee morale 

vf relies significantly on information technology any inadequacy interruption integration failure or security failure of this technology could harm vf’s ability to effectively operate its business 

our ability to effectively manage and operate our business depends significantly on information technology systems we rely heavily on information technology to track sales and inventory and manage our supply chain we are also dependent on information technology including the internet for our directtoconsumer sales including our ecommerce operations and retail business credit card transaction authorization despite our preventative efforts our systems and those of our thirdparty service providers may be vulnerable to damage failure or interruption due to viruses data security incidents technical malfunctions natural disasters or other causes or in connection with upgrades to our system or the implementation of new systems the failure of these systems to operate effectively or remain innovative problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems difficulty in integrating new systems or systems of acquired businesses or a breach in security of these systems could adversely impact the operations of vf’s business including our reputation management of inventory ordering and replenishment of products sourcing and distribution of products ecommerce operations retail business credit card transaction authorization and processing corporate email communications and our interaction with the public on social media moreover failure to provide effective digital including omnichannel capabilities and information technology infrastructure could result in an inability to meet current and future business needs and a resulting loss of brand competitiveness leading to loss of revenue and market share and decreased business agility 

vf is subject to data and information security and privacy risks that could negatively affect its business operations results of operations or reputation 

in the normal course of business we often collect retain and transmit certain sensitive and confidential customer information including credit card information and employee information over public networks there is a significant concern by consumers and employees over the security of personal information collected retained or transmitted over the internet identity theft and user privacy data and information security breaches are increasingly sophisticated and can be difficult to detect for long periods of time accordingly if unauthorized parties gain access to our networks or databases or those of our thirdparty service providers they may be able to steal publish delete hold ransom or modify our private and sensitive information including credit card information personal information and confidential or other proprietary business information we have implemented systems and processes 

designed to protect against unauthorized access to or use of personal information and other confidential information and rely on encryption and authentication technology to effectively secure transmission of such information including credit card information despite these security measures there is no guarantee that they will prevent all unauthorized access to our systems and information and our facilities and systems and those of our thirdparty service providers may be vulnerable and unable to anticipate or detect security breaches and data loss in addition employees may intentionally or inadvertently cause data security breaches that result in the unauthorized release of personal or confidential information vf and its customers could suffer harm if valuable business data or employee customer and other confidential and proprietary information were corrupted lost or accessed or misappropriated by third parties due to a security failure in vf’s systems or due to one of our thirdparty service providers or our employees it could require significant expenditures to remediate any such failure or breach severely damage our reputation confidence in our ecommerce platforms and our relationships with customers and employees result in business disruption unwanted and negative media attention and lost sales and expose us to risks of litigation liability and increased scrutiny from regulatory entities in addition as a result of recent security breaches at a number of prominent retailers the media and public scrutiny of information security and privacy has become more intense and the regulatory environment has become increasingly uncertain rigorous and complex as a result we may incur significant costs to comply with laws regarding the privacy and security of personal information and we may not be able to comply with new data protection laws and regulations being adopted around the world any failure to comply with the laws and regulations and consumer expectations surrounding the privacy and security of personal information could subject us to legal and reputational risk including significant fines andor litigation for noncompliance in multiple jurisdictions negative media coverage diminished consumer confidence and decreased attraction to our brands any of which could have a negative impact on revenues and profits in addition while we maintain cyber insurance policies those existing insurance policies may not adequately protect vf from all of the adverse effects and damages that could be caused by a security breach moreover if our associates or vendors intentionally or inadvertently misuse consumer data or are not transparent with consumers about how we use their data our brands reputation and relationships with consumers could be damaged 

there are risks associated with vf’s acquisitions and portfolio management 

any acquisitions or mergers by vf will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of companies these risks include among other things higher than anticipated acquisition costs and expenses the difficulty and expense of integrating the operations systems and personnel of the companies and the loss of key employees and customers as a result of changes in management in addition geographic distances may make integration of acquired businesses more difficult we may not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with any acquisitions moreover failure to effectively manage vf’s portfolio of brands in line with growth targets and shareholder expectations including acquisition choices integration approach and divestiture timing could result in unfavorable impacts to growth and value creation 

vf corporation fiscal 2022 form 10k 13 

our acquisitions may cause large onetime expenses or create goodwill or other intangible assets that could result in significant impairment charges in the future we also make certain estimates and assumptions in order to determine purchase price allocation and estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed if our estimates or assumptions used to value these assets and liabilities are not accurate we may be exposed to losses that may be material 

vf uses thirdparty suppliers and manufacturing facilities worldwide for its raw materials and finished products which poses risks to vf’s business operations 

during fiscal 2022 vf’s products were sourced from independent manufacturers primarily located in asia any of the following could impact our ability to source or deliver vf products or our cost of sourcing or delivering products and as a result our profitability 

• political or labor instability in countries where vf’s contractors and suppliers are located 

• changes in local economic conditions in countries where vf’s contractors and suppliers are located 

• public health issues such as the covid19 pandemic have resulted in or could continue to result in closed factories reduced workforces scarcity of raw materials and scrutiny or embargoing of goods produced in infected areas 

• political or military conflict could cause a delay in the transportation of products to vf and an increase in transportation costs 

• disruption at ports of entry could cause delays in product availability and increase transportation times and costs 

• heightened terrorism security concerns could subject imported or exported goods to additional more frequent or lengthier inspections leading to delays in deliveries or impoundment of goods for extended periods 

• decreased scrutiny by customs officials for counterfeit goods leading to more counterfeit goods and reduced sales of vf products increased costs for vf’s anticounterfeiting measures and damage to the reputation of its brands 

• disruptions at manufacturing or distribution facilities or in shipping and transportation locations caused by natural and manmade disasters 

• imposition of regulations and quotas relating to imports and our ability to adjust timely to changes in trade regulations could limit our ability to source products in costeffective countries that have the required labor and expertise 

• imposition of duties taxes and other charges on imports and 

• imposition or the repeal of laws that affect intellectual property rights 

although no single supplier and no one country is critical to vf’s production needs if we were to lose a supplier it could result in interruption of finished goods shipments to vf cancellation of orders by customers and termination of relationships this along with the damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on vf’s revenues and consequently our results of operations 

in addition although we audit our thirdparty material suppliers and contracted manufacturing facilities and set strict compliance standards actions by a thirdparty supplier or manufacturer that fail to comply could result in such thirdparty supplier failing to manufacture products that consistently meet our quality standards or engaging in unfavorable labor practices or providing unfavorable working conditions that negatively impact worker health safety and wellness such noncompliance could expose vf to claims for damages financial penalties and reputational harm any of which could have a material adverse effect in our business and operations 

a significant portion of vf’s revenues and gross profit is derived from a small number of large customers the loss of any of these customers or the inability of any of these customers to pay vf could substantially reduce vf’s revenues and profits 

a few of vf’s customers account for a significant portion of revenues sales to vf’s ten largest customers were approximately 17 of total revenues in fiscal 2022 with our largest customer accounting for approximately 2 of revenues sales to our customers are generally on a purchase or der basis and not subject to longterm agreements a decision by any of vf’s major customers to significantly decrease the volume of products purchased from vf could substantially reduce revenues and have a material adverse effect on vf’s financial condition and results of operations 

talent management employee retention and experience are important factors in vf’s success 

our future success also depends on our ability to attract develop and retain talent with the necessary knowledge skills and experience and maintain a culture of wellbeing empowerment and diversity and inclusion to ensure vf is innovative and remains competitive in a rapidlychanging global marketplace competition for experienced and wellqualified personnel is intense and we may not be successful in attracting developing and retaining such personnel which could impact vf’s ability to remain competitive additionally changes to our office environments the adoption of new work models and our requirements andor expectations about when or how often certain employees work onsite or remotely may not meet the expectations of our employees as businesses increasingly operate remotely traditional geographic competition for talent may change in ways that we cannot presently predict if our employment proposition is not perceived as favorable compared to other companies it could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain our employees if we are unable to retain attract and motivate talented employees with the appropriate skill sets or if changes to our organizational structure operating results or business model adversely affect morale or retention we may not achieve our objectives and our results of operations could be adversely impacted vf depends on the services and management experience of its executive officers and business leaders who have substantial experience and expertise in vf’s business and in developing and retaining employees the unexpected loss of services of one or more of these individuals or the inability to effectively identify a suitable successor to a key role could have a material adverse effect on vf 

14 vf corporation fiscal 2022 form 10k 

vf’s directtoconsumer business includes risks that could have an adverse effect on its results of operations 

vf sells merchandise direct to consumer through vfoperated stores and ecommerce sites its directtoconsumer business is subject to numerous risks that could have a material adverse effect on its results risks include but are not limited to i us or international resellers purchasing merchandise and reselling it overseas outside vf’s control ii failure or interruption of the systems that operate the stores and websites and their related support systems including due to computer viruses theft of customer information privacy concerns telecommunication failures electronic breakins and similar disruptions technical malfunctions and natural disasters or other causes iii credit card fraud iv risks related to vf’s directtoconsumer distribution centers and processes and v shift in consumer preferences away from retail stores risks specific to vf’s ecommerce business also include i diversion of sales from vf stores or wholesale customers ii difficulty in recreating the instore experience through direct channels iii liability for online content iv changing patterns of consumer behavior and v intense competition from online retailers vf’s failure to successfully respond to these risks might adversely affect sales in its ecommerce business as well as damage its reputation and brands 

our vfoperated stores and ecommerce business require substantial fixed investments in equipment and leasehold improvements information systems inventory and personnel we have entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space due to the high fixedcost structure associated with our directtoconsumer operations a decline in sales or the closure of or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs writeoffs of equipment and leasehold improvements and employeerelated costs 

vf’s net sales depend on the volume of traffic to its stores and the availability of suitable lease space 

a significant portion of our revenues are directtoconsumer sales through vfoperated stores in order to generate customer traffic we locate many of our stores in prominent locations within successful retail shopping centers or in fashionable shopping districts our stores benefit from the ability of the retail center and other attractions in an area to generate consumer traffic in the vicinity of our stores part of our future growth is significantly dependent on our ability to operate stores in desirable locations with capital investment and lease costs providing the opportunity to earn a reasonable return we cannot control the development of new shopping centers or districts the availability or cost of appropriate locations within existing or new shopping centers or districts competition with other retailers for prominent locations or the success of individual shopping centers or districts further if we are unable to renew or replace our existing store leases or enter into leases for new stores on favorable terms or if we violate the terms of our current leases our growth and profitability could be harmed all of these factors may impact our ability to meet our growth targets and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

vf may be unable to protect its trademarks and other intellectual property rights 

vf’s trademarks and other intellectual property rights are important to its success and its competitive position vf is 

susceptible to others copying its products and infringing its intellectual property rights especially with the shift in product mix to higher priced brands and innovative new products in recent years some of vf’s brands such as vans ®  the north face ®  timberland ®  dickies ® and supreme ® enjoy significant worldwide consumer recognition and the higher pricing of certain of the brands products creates additional risk of counterfeiting and infringement 

vf’s trademarks trade names patents trade secrets and other intellectual property are important to vf’s success counterfeiting of vf’s products or infringement on its intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our brands and adversely affect vf’s revenues actions we have taken to establish and protect vf’s intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent copying of its products by others or to prevent others from seeking to invalidate its trademarks or block sales of vf’s products as a violation of the trademarks and intellectual property rights of others in addition unilateral actions in the us or other countries including changes to or the repeal of laws recognizing trademark or other intellectual property rights such as the russian governments recent announcements that it would not protect intellectual property rights including patent rights and rights that could block parallel imports of gray market goods as a result of the sanctions imposed on russia in connection with the russiaukraine conflict could have an impact on vf’s ability to enforce those rights 

the value of vf’s intellectual property could diminish if others assert rights in or ownership of trademarks and other intellectual property rights of vf or trademarks that are similar to vf’s trademarks or trademarks that vf licenses from others we may be unable to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction in some cases there may be trademark owners who have prior rights to vf’s trademarks because the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the us in other cases there may be holders who have prior rights to similar trademarks 

there have been and there may in the future be opposition and cancellation proceedings from time to time with respect to some of vfs intellectual property rights in some cases litigation may be necessary to protect or enforce our trademarks and other intellectual property rights furthermore third parties may assert intellectual property claims against us and we may be subject to liability required to enter into costly license agreements if available at all required to rebrand our products andor prevented from selling some of our products if third parties successfully oppose or challenge our trademarks or successfully claim that we infringe misappropriate or otherwise violate their trademarks copyrights patents or other intellectual property rights bringing or defending any such claim regardless of merit and whether successful or unsuccessful could be expensive and timeconsuming and have a negative effect on vfs business reputation results of operations and financial condition 

if vf encounters problems with its distribution system vf’s ability to deliver its products to the market could be adversely affected 

vf relies on owned or leased vfoperated and third partyoperated distribution facilities to warehouse and ship product to vf customers vf’s distribution system includes computercontrolled and automated equipment which may be subject to a 

vf corporation fiscal 2022 form 10k 15 

number of risks related to security or computer viruses the proper operation of software and hardware power interruptions or other system failures because substantially all of vf’s products are distributed from a relatively small number of locations vf’s operations could also be interrupted by earthquakes floods fires or other natural disasters or other events outside vfs control affecting its distribution centers including political or labor instability we maintain business interruption insurance under our property and cyber insurance policies but it may not adequately protect vf from the adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in vf’s distribution facilities in addition vf’s distribution capacity is dependent on the timely performance of services by third parties including the transportation of product to and from its distribution facilities if we encounter problems with our distribution system our ability to meet customer expectations manage inventory complete sales and achieve operating efficiencies could be materially adversely affected 

vf’s business and operations could be materially and adversely affected if it fails to create systems of monitoring prevention response crisis management continuity and recovery to mitigate natural or manmade economic political or environmental disruptions 

business resiliency is important to vf’s success because there are a variety of risks generally associated with doing business on a global basis that may involve natural or manmade economic political or environmental disruptions disruptions and government responses to any disruption could cause among other things a decrease in consumer spending that would negatively impact our sales delays in the fulfillment or cancellation of customer orders or disruptions in the manufacture and shipment of products increased costs and a negative impact on our reputation and longterm growth plans the impact of disruptions may vary based on the length and severity of the disruption vf’s failure to create and implement systems of monitoring prevention response crisis management continuity and recovery to anticipate prepare prevent mitigate and respond to potential threats impacting its business people processes and facilities could result in extended disruptions and unpredictability 



vf’s operations and earnings may be affected by legal regulatory political and economic uncertainty and risks 

our ability to maintain the current level of operations in our existing markets and to capitalize on growth in existing and new markets is subject to legal regulatory political and economic uncertainty and risks these include the burdens of complying with us and international laws and regulations and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements 

changes in regulatory geopolitical policies and other factors may adversely affect vf’s business or may require us to modify our current business practices while enactment of any such change is not certain if such changes were adopted or if we failed to anticipate and mitigate the impact of such changes our costs could increase which would reduce our earnings for example on january 31 2020 the united kingdom ceased to be a member state of the european union commonly referred to as “brexit” the united kingdom and the european union subsequently reached a provisional postbrexit trade and cooperation agreement that contains new rules governing the relationship between the united kingdom and europe including with respect to trade travel and immigration brexit could adversely affect european and worldwide economic and market conditions and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets any of these effects of brexit and others we cannot anticipate could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

beginning in february 2022 in response to the military conflict between russia and ukraine the us and other north atlantic treaty organization member states as well as nonmember states announced targeted economic sanctions on russia including certain russian citizens and enterprises and the continuation of the conflict may trigger additional economic and other sanctions to date we have experienced revenue impacts due to cessation of business in russia currency devaluation and costs associated with compliance with sanctions and other regulations in addition as of april 2 2022 there was approximately 310 million of cash in russia that although it can be used without limits within russia is currently limited on 

movement out of russia further impacts of the conflict could include macro financial impacts resulting from the exclusion of russian financial institutions from the global banking system volatility in foreign exchange rates and interest rates inflationary pressures on raw materials and energy heightened cybersecurity threats harm to employee health and safety reputational harm increase in counterfeiting and intellectual property activity nationalization of our assets and additional costs associated with compliance with sanctions and other regulations and risks associated with failure to comply with the same although our operations in russia are not significant the conflict could escalate and result in broader economic and security concerns including in other geographies which could in turn adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

changes to us or international trade policy tariff and importexport regulations or our failure to comply with such regulations may have a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition and results of operations 

changes in us or international social political regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade manufacturing development and investment in the territories or countries where we currently sell our products or conduct our business as well as any negative sentiment toward the us as a result of such changes could adversely affect our business for example the us government has instituted changes in trade policies imposing higher tariffs on imports into the us from china tariffs and other changes in us trade policy have in the past and could continue to trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries and certain foreign governments have instituted considered or are considering imposing retaliatory measures on certain us goods vf similar to many other multinational corporations does a significant amount of business that would be impacted by changes to the trade policies of the us and foreign countries including governmental action related to tariffs international trade agreements or economic sanctions such changes have the potential to adversely impact the us economy or certain sectors thereof our industry and the global demand for our products and as a result could have a 

16 vf corporation fiscal 2022 form 10k 

material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

changes in tax laws could increase our worldwide tax rate and tax liabilities and materially affect our financial position and results of operations 

we are subject to taxation in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act “us tax act” which included a broad range of tax reform proposals affecting businesses including a reduction in the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 a onetime mandatory deemed repatriation tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously taxdeferred and a new minimum tax on certain foreign earnings taxes related to the onetime mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings due over a period of time could be accelerated upon certain triggering events including failure to pay such taxes when due in addition regulatory administrative and legislative guidance related to the us tax act continues to be released to the extent any future guidance differs from our interpretation of the law or the current us presidential administration takes further action including through its proposal of a higher us federal corporate tax rate and increased taxation of offshore income such guidance or action could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 

in addition many countries in the european union eu and around the globe have adopted andor proposed changes to current tax laws further organizations such as the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd have published action plans that if adopted by countries where we do business could increase our tax obligations and compliance costs in these countries more specifically the oecd has released rules to address tax challenges arising from the digitalization of the economy the ultimate outcome of these rules that are enacted into law in each country may result in a material financial impact to vf 

due to the large scale of our us and international business activities many of these enacted and proposed changes to the taxation of our activities could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations 

we may have additional tax liabilities from new or evolving government or judicial interpretation of existing tax laws 

as a global company we determine our income tax liability in various tax jurisdictions based on an analysis and interpretation of us and international tax laws and regulations this analysis requires a significant amount of judgment and estimation and is often based on various assumptions about the future actions of tax authorities these determinations are the subject of periodic us and international tax audits and court proceedings in particular tax authorities and the courts have increased their focus on income earned in no or lowtax jurisdictions or income that is not taxed in any jurisdiction tax authorities have also become skeptical of special tax rulings provided to companies offering lower taxes than may be applicable in other countries 

for example vf was granted a ruling which lowered the effective income tax rate on taxable earnings for years 2010 through 2014 under belgium’s excess profit tax regime during 

2015 the eu investigated and announced its decision that the ruling was illegal and ordered that tax benefits granted under the ruling should be collected from the affected companies including vf europe bvba a subsidiary of vf requests for annulment were filed by belgium and vf europe bvba individually during 2017 and 2018 vf europe bvba was assessed and paid €350 million in tax and interest which was recorded as an income tax receivable based on the expected success of the requests for annulment during 2019 the general court annulled the eu decision and the eu subsequently appealed the general court’s annulment in september 2021 the general court’s judgment was set aside by the court of justice of the eu and the case was sent back to the general court to determine whether the excess profit tax regime amounted to illegal state aid the case remains open and unresolved if this matter is adversely resolved the tax and interest amounts paid by vf will not be collected by vf 

also as previously reported vf petitioned the us tax court the court to resolve an internal revenue service irs dispute regarding the timing of income inclusion associated with vfs acquisition of the timberland company in september 2011 while the irs argues that all such income should have been immediately included in 2011 vf has reported periodic income inclusions in subsequent tax years both parties moved for summary judgment on the issue and on january 31 2022 the court issued its opinion in favor of the irs vf believes the opinion of the court was in error based on the technical merits and intends to appeal however vf will be required to pay the 2011 taxes and interest being disputed or post a surety bond it is anticipated that during fiscal 2023 the irs will assess and vf will pay the 2011 taxes and interest which would be recorded as a tax receivable based on the technical merits of our position with regards to the case the gross amount of taxes and interest as of april 2 2022 was estimated at approximately 8450 million and will continue to accrue interest until paid vf continues to believe its timing and treatment of the income inclusion is appropriate and vf is vigorously defending its position however should the court opinion ultimately be upheld on appeal this tax receivable may not be collected by vf if the court opinion is upheld vf should be entitled to a refund of taxes paid on the periodic inclusions that vf has reported however any such refund could be substantially reduced by potential indirect tax effects resulting from application of the court opinion deferred tax liabilities representing vf’s future tax on annual inclusions would also be released the net impact to tax expense estimated as of april 2 2022 could be up to 7000 million  

although we accrue for uncertain tax positions our accrual may be insufficient to satisfy unfavorable findings unfavorable audit findings or court interpretations involving vf or other companies with similar tax profiles may result in payment of taxes fines and penalties for prior periods and higher tax rates in future periods which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

our business is subject to national state and local laws and regulations for environmental consumer protection corporate governance competition employment privacy safety and other matters the costs of compliance with or the violation of such laws and regulations by vf or by independent suppliers who manufacture products for vf could have an adverse effect on our operations and cash flows as well as on our reputation 

our business is subject to comprehensive national state and local laws and regulations on a wide range of environmental 

vf corporation fiscal 2022 form 10k 17 

climate change consumer protection employment privacy safety and other matters vf could be adversely affected by costs of compliance with or violations of those laws and regulations in addition while we do not control their business practices we require thirdparty suppliers to operate in compliance with applicable laws rules and regulations regarding working conditions safety employment practices and environmental compliance the costs of products purchased by vf from independent contractors could increase due to the costs of compliance by those contractors 

failure by vf or its thirdparty suppliers to comply with such laws and regulations as well as with ethical social product safety labor and environmental standards or related political considerations could result in interruption of finished goods shipments to vf extensive remediation efforts cancellation of orders by customers and termination of relationships if vf or one of our independent contractors violates labor or other laws implements labor or other business practices or takes other actions that are generally regarded as unethical it could result in unwanted or negative media attention jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions including boycotts that may reduce demand for vf’s merchandise damage to vf’s reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on vf’s results of operations financial condition and cash flows as well as require additional resources to rebuild vf’s reputation 

our international operations are also subject to compliance with the us foreign corrupt practices act the “fcpa” and other antibribery laws applicable to our operations although we have policies and procedures to address compliance with the fcpa and similar laws there can be no assurance that all of our employees agents and other partners will not take actions in violation of our policies any such violation could subject us to sanctions or other penalties that could negatively affect our reputation business and operating results 

climate change and increased focus by governmental and nongovernmental organizations customers consumers and investors on sustainability issues including those related to climate change and socially responsible activities may adversely affect our business and financial results and damage our reputation 

climate change is occurring around the world and may impact our business in numerous ways failure to monitor adapt build 

resilience and develop solutions against the physical and transitional impacts from climate change may lead to revenue loss market share loss business interruptions and rising costs climate change could lead to increased volatility due to physical impacts of climate change on the supply chain including the availability quality and cost of raw materials increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events storms and floods could cause increased incidence of disruption to the production and distribution of our products and an adverse impact on consumer demand and spending 

investor advocacy groups certain institutional investors investment funds other market participants shareholders and other stakeholders including nongovernmental organizations employees and consumers have focused increasingly on the environmental social and governance esg and related sustainability practices of companies these parties have placed increased importance on the implications of the social cost of their investments andor have higher expectations of corporate conduct if our esg practices do not meet investor or other stakeholder expectations and standards including related to climate change sustainability and human rights and do not meet related regulations and expectations for increased transparency which continue to evolve our brands reputation and employee retention may be negatively impacted it is possible that stakeholders may not be satisfied with our esg practices or the speed of their adoption while we may announce voluntary esg targets we may not be able to meet such targets in the manner or on such a timeline as initially contemplated including but not limited to as a result of unforeseen costs or technical difficulties associated with achieving such results we could also incur additional costs and require additional resources to monitor report and comply with various esg practices and regulations also our failure or perceived failure to manage reputational threats and meet stakeholder expectations or shifting consumer preferences with respect to socially responsible activities and products and packaging and sustainability commitments and regulations could negatively impact our brand image reputation credibility employee retention and the willingness of our customers and suppliers to do business with us 



vf’s balance sheet includes a significant amount of intangible assets and goodwill a decline in the fair value of an intangible asset or of a business unit could result in an asset impairment charge which would be recorded as an operating expense in vf’s consolidated statement of operations and could be material 

vf’s policy is to evaluate indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill for possible impairment as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of such assets may be below their carrying amount in addition intangible assets that are being amortized are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable for these impairment tests we use various valuation methods to estimate the fair value of our business units and intangible assets if the fair value of an asset is less 

than its carrying value we would recognize an impairment charge for the difference 

it is possible that we could have an impairment charge for goodwill or trademark and trade name intangible assets in future periods if i overall economic conditions in fiscal 2023 or future years vary from our current assumptions ii business conditions or our strategies for a specific business unit change from our current assumptions including changes in discount rates iii investors require higher rates of return on equity investments in the marketplace or iv enterprise values of comparable publicly traded companies or of actual sales transactions of comparable companies were to decline resulting in lower comparable multiples of revenues and earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and accordingly lower implied values of goodwill and intangible 

18 vf corporation fiscal 2022 form 10k 

assets a future impairment charge for goodwill or intangible assets could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

fluctuations in wage rates and the price availability and quality of raw materials and finished goods could increase costs 

fluctuations in the price availability and quality of purchased finished goods or the fabrics leather cotton or other raw materials used therein could have a material adverse effect on vf’s cost of goods sold or its ability to meet its customers’ demands prices of purchased finished products may depend on wage rate increases required by legal or industry standards in asia and other geographic areas where our independent contractors are located as well as increasing freight costs from those regions inflation including as a result of inflationary pressures related to global supply chain disruptions can also have a longterm impact on us because increasing costs of materials and labor may impact our ability to maintain satisfactory margins for example the cost and availability of the materials that are used in our products such as oilrelated commodity prices and other raw materials such as cotton dyes and chemical and other costs such as fuel energy and utility costs can fluctuate significantly as a result of inflation in addition to many other factors including general economic conditions and demand crop yields energy prices weather patterns public health issues such as the covid19 pandemic and speculation in the commodities markets a significant portion of our products also are manufactured in other countries and declines in the values of the us dollar may result in higher manufacturing costs in the future vf may not be able to offset cost increases with other cost reductions or efficiencies or to pass higher costs on to its customers this could have a material adverse effect on vf’s results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

vf’s business is exposed to the risks of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations vf’s hedging strategies may not be effective in mitigating those risks 

a growing percentage of vf’s total revenues approximately 48 in fiscal 2022 is derived from markets outside the us vf’s international businesses operate in functional currencies other than the us dollar changes in currency exchange rates affect the us dollar value of the foreign currencydenominated amounts at which vf’s international businesses purchase products incur costs or sell products in addition for vf’s usbased businesses the majority of products are sourced from independent contractors located in foreign countries as a result the costs of these products are affected by changes in the value of the relevant currencies furthermore much of vf’s licensing revenue is derived from sales in foreign currencies changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse impact on vf’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in accordance with our operating practices we hedge a significant portion of our foreign currency transaction exposures arising in the ordinary course of business to reduce risks in our cash flows and earnings our hedging strategy may not be effective in reducing all risks and no hedging strategy can completely insulate vf from foreign exchange risk 

further our use of derivative financial instruments may expose vf to counterparty risks although vf only enters into hedging contracts with counterparties having investment grade credit 

ratings it is possible that the credit quality of a counterparty could be downgraded or a counterparty could default on its obligations which could have a material adverse impact on vf’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our ability to obtain financing on favorable terms if needed could be adversely affected by geopolitical risk and volatility in the capital markets 

any disruption in the capital markets could limit the availability of funds or the ability or willingness of financial institutions to extend capital in the future future volatility in the financial and credit markets including the recent volatility due in part to the covid19 pandemic andor the conflict in ukraine could make it more difficult for us to obtain financing or refinance existing debt when the need arises including upon maturity or on terms that would be acceptable to us this disruption or volatility could adversely affect our liquidity and funding resources or significantly increase our cost of capital an inability to access capital and credit markets may have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

effective january 1 2022 the publication of libor on a representative basis ceased for the oneweek and twomonth us dollar libor settings and all sterling yen euros and swiss franc libor settings all other remaining us dollar libor settings will cease july 1 2023 in connection with the sunset of certain libor reference rates occurring at the end of 2021 we amended the credit agreement for our senior unsecured revolving credit facility to include provisions for the replacement of libor upon the cessation thereof that are customary for credit facilities of this nature we continue to monitor developments related to the upcoming transition from us dollar libor settings to an alternative benchmark reference rate the alternative reference rates committee has proposed the secured overnight financing rate sofr as its recommended alternative to us dollar libor and the federal reserve bank of new york began publishing sofr rates in april 2018 at this time the effects of the phase out of us dollar libor and the adoption of alternative benchmark rates have not been fully determined but uncertainty regarding rates may make borrowing or refinancing our indebtedness more expensive or difficult to achieve on terms we consider favorable 

vf’s indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on its business financial condition and results of operations and prevent vf from fulfilling its financial obligations and vf may not be able to maintain its current credit ratings may not continue to pay dividends or repurchase its common stock and may not remain in compliance with existing debt covenants 

as of april 2 2022 vf had approximately 54 billion of debt outstanding v f’s debt and interest payment requirements could have important consequences on its business financial condition and results of operations for example it could 

• require vf to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to repaying its indebtedness which would reduce the availability of its cash flow to fund working capital requirements capital expenditures future acquisitions dividends repurchase vf’s common stock and for other general corporate purposes 

• limit vf’s flexibility in planning for or reacting to general adverse economic conditions or changes in its business and the industries in which it operates 

vf corporation fiscal 2022 form 10k 19 

• place vf at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that have less indebtedness outstanding and 

• negatively affect vfs credit ratings and limit along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in vf’s debt documents and its ability to borrow additional funds 

in addition vf may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future to fund acquisitions repurchase common stock or fund other activities for general business purposes if vf incurs additional indebtedness it may limit vf’s ability to access the debt capital markets or other forms of financing in the future and may result in increased borrowing costs 

although vf has historically declared and paid quarterly cash dividends on its common stock and has been authorized to repurchase its stock subject to certain limitations under its share repurchase programs any determinations by the board of directors to continue to declare and pay cash dividends on vf’s common stock or to repurchase vf’s common stock will be based primarily upon vf’s financial condition results of operations and business requirements its access to debt capital markets or other forms of financing the price of its common stock in the case of the repurchase program and the board of directors’ continuing determination that the repurchase programs and the declaration and payment of dividends are in the best interests of vf’s shareholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the repurchase and dividend programs in the event vf does not declare and pay a quarterly dividend or discontinues its share repurchases vf’s stock price could be adversely affected 

vf is required to comply with certain financial and other restrictive debt covenants in its debt documents failure by vf to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default that if not cured or waived could have a material adverse effect on vf if the lenders declare any outstanding obligations to be immediately due and payable 

vf is subject to the risk that its licensees may not generate expected sales or maintain the value of vf’s brands 

during fiscal 2022 666 million of vf’s revenues were derived from licensing royalties a lthough vf generally has significant control over its licensees’ products and advertising we rely on our licensees for among other things operational and financial controls over their businesses failure of our licensees to successfully market licensed products or our inability to replace existing licensees if necessary could adversely affect vf’s revenues both directly from reduced royalties received and indirectly from reduced sales of our other products risks are also associated with a licensee’s ability to 

• obtain capital 

• manage its labor relations 

• maintain relationships with its suppliers 

• manage its credit risk effectively 

• maintain relationships with its customers and 

• adhere to vf’s global compliance principles 

in addition vf relies on its licensees to help preserve the value of its brands although we attempt to protect vf’s brands through approval rights over design production processes quality packaging merchandising distribution advertising and promotion of our licensed products we cannot completely 

control the use of licensed vf brands by our licensees the misuse of a brand by a licensee including through the marketing of products under one of our brand names that do not meet our quality standards could have a material adverse effect on that brand and on vf 

volatility in securities markets interest rates and other economic factors could substantially increase vf’s defined benefit pension costs 

vf currently has obligations under its defined benefit pension plans the funded status of the pension plans is dependent on many factors including returns on investment assets and the discount rates used to determine pension obligations unfavorable impacts from returns on plan assets decreases in discount rates changes in plan demographics or revisions in the applicable laws or regulations could materially change the timing and amount of pension funding requirements which could reduce cash available for vf’s business 

vf’s operating performance also may be negatively impacted by the amount of expense recorded for its pension plans pension expense is calculated using actuarial valuations that incorporate assumptions and estimates about financial market economic and demographic conditions differences between estimated and actual results give rise to gains and losses that are deferred and amortized as part of future pension expense which can create volatility that adversely impacts vf’s future operating results 

the spinoff of kontoor brands inc could result in substantial tax liability to us and our shareholders 

we received opinions of tax advisors substantially to the effect that for us federal income tax purposes the may 22 2019 spinoff of our jeans business kontoor brands inc kontoor brands and certain related transactions qualify for taxfree treatment under certain sections of the internal revenue code however if the factual assumptions or representations made by us in connection with the delivery of the opinions are inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect including those relating to the past and future conduct of our business we will not be able to rely on the opinions furthermore the opinions are not binding on the irs or the courts if notwithstanding receipt of the opinions the spinoff transaction and certain related transactions are determined to be taxable we would be subject to a substantial tax liability in addition if the spinoff transaction is taxable each holder of our common stock who received shares of kontoor brands in connection with the spinoff would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares received 

even if the spinoff otherwise qualifies as a taxfree transaction the distribution would be taxable to us but not to our shareholders in certain circumstances if future significant acquisitions of our stock or the stock of kontoor brands are deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that included the spinoff in this event the resulting tax liability could be substantial in connection with the spinoff we entered into a tax matters agreement with kontoor brands pursuant to which kontoor brands agreed to not enter into any transaction that could cause any portion of the spinoff to be taxable to us without our consent and to indemnify us for any tax liability resulting from any such transaction in addition these potential tax liabilities may discourage delay or prevent a change of control of us

the coronavirus covid19 pandemic significantly impacted global economic conditions as well as vfs business operations and financial performance during fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 as the global impact of covid19 continues vf remains first and foremost focused on a peoplefirst approach that prioritizes the health and wellbeing of its employees customers trade partners and consumers around the world to help mitigate the spread of covid19 and in response to health advisors and governmental actions and regulations vf has modified its business practices including the temporary closing of offices and retail stores instituting travel bans and restrictions and implementing health and safety measures including social distancing and quarantines vf has also implemented measures 

that are designed to ensure the health safety and wellbeing of associates employed in its distribution and fulfillment centers around the world

consistent with vf’s longterm strategy the company’s digital platform remains a high priority through which its brands stay connected with consumer communities while providing experiential content prior to the covid19 pandemic consumer spending had started shifting to brand ecommerce sites and other digital platforms which accelerated due to changes in the retail landscape resulting from the covid19 pandemic 

covid19 has also impacted some of vfs suppliers including raw material suppliers thirdparty manufacturers logistics providers and other vendors at this time the majority of vfs supply chain is operational suppliers are complying with local health advisories and governmental restrictions which has resulted in product delays the resurgence of covid19 lockdowns in key sourcing countries resulted in additional manufacturing capacity constraints during fiscal 2022 however the situation improved over time additionally fiscal 2022 was impacted by continued port congestion lengthened transit times equipment availability and other logistics challenges these issues caused significant product delays which resulted in challenges to timely meet customer demand in fiscal 2022 vf worked with its suppliers to minimize disruption and employed expedited freight as needed vfs distribution centers are

subsidies the company recognized 814 million during the year ended march 2021 as a result of relief from the cares act and other governmental packages which were recorded as a reduction in selling general and administrative expenses 

the covid19 pandemic is ongoing and dynamic in nature and has driven global uncertainty and disruption while we are not able to determine the ultimate length and severity of the covid19 pandemic we expect ongoing disruption to our business 



vf has taken actions to advance its enterprise protection strategy in response to the covid19 pandemic 

at march 2022 vf had approximately 13 billion of cash and equivalents additionally vf had approximately 19 billion available for borrowing against the global credit facility subject to certain restrictions 

the company made the decision to temporarily pause its share repurchase program on april 7 2020 the company decided to reinstate the program during the third quarter of fiscal 2022 and completed 3500 million of repurchases during fiscal 2022 which leaves vf with 25 billion remaining under its share repurchase authorization the company paid a cash dividend of 198 per share during the year ended march 2022 and has declared a cash dividend of 050 per share that is payable in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 subject to approval by its board of directors vf intends to continue to pay its regularly scheduled dividend 

the company has also commenced a multiyear initiative designed to enable our ability to accelerate and advance vfs business model transformation one of the key objectives of this initiative is to deliver global cost savings over a threeyear period that will be used to support the transformation agenda and highestpriority growth drivers the company is on track to deliver the cost savings as contemplated in this initiative as vf continues to actively monitor the situation and advance our business model transformation we may take further actions that affect our operations 

we believe the company has sufficient liquidity and flexibility to operate and continue to execute our strategy during the disruptions caused by the covid19 pandemic and related governmental actions and regulations and health authority advisories and meet its obligations as they become due however there continues to be uncertainty about the duration and extent of the impact of covid19 governmental actions in response to the pandemic and the impact on us and our consumers customers and suppliers see item 1a risk factors for additional discussion

• increase in inventories — primarily due to recovery from the negative impact of covid19 on the comparative period 

• decrease in shortterm investments — due to the sale of shortterm investments 

• increase in shortterm borrowings — due to an increase in commercial paper borrowings 

• increase in the current portion of longterm debt — due to the reclassification of 5000 million of longterm notes due in april 2022 

• increase in accrued liabilities — primarily due to an increase in accrued income taxes resulting from the reclassification of a portion of the accrual for unrecognized tax benefits and certain deferred income taxes from other liabilities due to the timing of expected settlement and payment and the reclassification of the contingent consideration liability associated with the supreme acquisition from other liabilities 

• decrease in longterm debt — due to the reclassification of 5000 million of longterm notes due in april 2022 and the early redemption of 5000 million of longterm notes in december 2021

32 vf corporation fiscal 2022 form 10k 



we consider the following to be measures of our liquidity and capital resources 



the decrease in the current ratio at march 2022 compared to march 2021 was primarily due to a net increase in current liabilities driven by a higher current portion of longterm debt higher shortterm borrowings and higher accrued liabilities as discussed in the balance sheets section above 

for the ratio of net debt to total capital net debt is defined as shortterm and longterm borrowings in addition to operating lease liabilities net of unrestricted cash total capital is defined as net debt plus stockholders’ equity the decrease in the net debt to total capital ratio at march 2022 compared to march 2021 was primarily driven by a decrease in net debt due to the 5000 million early redemption of 2050 senior notes due april 2022 during fiscal 2022 and higher cash balances at march 2022 partially offset by higher shortterm borrowings at march 2022 the decrease in the net debt to total capital ratio was also due to 

an increase in stockholders equity which was driven by net income in the period partially offset by payments of dividends and share repurchases 

vf’s primary source of liquidity is its expected annual cash flow from operating activities cash from operations is typically lower in the first half of the calendar year as inventory builds to support peak sales periods in the second half of the calendar year cash provided by operating activities in the second half of the calendar year is substantially higher as inventories are sold and accounts receivable are collected additionally directtoconsumer sales are typically highest in the fourth quarter of the calendar year  vfs additional sources of liquidity include available borrowing capacity against its global credit facility available cash balances and international lines of credit 

in summary our cash flows from continuing operations were as follows 



cash provided by operating activities 

cash flow related to operating activities is dependent on net income adjustments to net income and changes in working capital the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 is primarily due to a decrease in net cash provided by working capital partially offset by higher earnings for the periods compared 

cash provided used by investing activities 

the decrease in cash used by investing activities in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 was primarily due to 6169 million of net proceeds from the sale of the occupational workwear business and 5988 million of proceeds from the sale of shortterm investments in fiscal 2022 compared to the cash paid to acquire supreme of 20 billion net of cash received in fiscal 2021 fiscal 2021 also included purchases of shortterm investments of 8000 million and proceeds from maturities of shortterm investments of 2000 million capital expenditures increased 468 million and software purchases increased 73 million in fiscal 2022 compared to the fiscal 2021 period 

cash provided used by financing activities 

the decrease in cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 was primarily due to the net proceeds from longterm debt issuances of 30 billion fixedrate notes in fiscal 2021 a 5025 million increase in payments 

on longterm debt and a 3500 million increase in share repurchases in fiscal 2022 which were partially offset by a 15 billion net decrease in shortterm borrowings for the periods compared 

share repurchases 

during fiscal 2022 vf purchased 48 million shares of its common stock in open market transactions at a total cost of 3500 million average price per share of 7284 under the share repurchase program authorized by vfs board of directors vf did not purchase shares of its common stock in the open market during fiscal 2021 

as of the end of fiscal 2022 vf had 25 billion remaining for future repurchases under its share repurchase authorization vf will continue to evaluate its use of capital g iving first priority to investments in organic growth and business acquisitions then to direct shareholder return in the form of dividends and share repurchases and enterprise protection 

revolving credit facility and shortterm borrowings 

vf relies on its ability to generate cash flows to finance its ongoing operations in addition vf has significant liquidity from its available cash balances and credit facilities in november 2021 vf entered into a 225 billion senior unsecured revolving line of credit the global credit facility that expires november 2026 the global credit facility replaced vfs 225 billion 

vf corporation fiscal 2022 form 10k 33 

revolving facility which was scheduled to expire in december 2023 vf may request an unlimited number of one year extensions so long as each extension does not cause the remaining life of the global credit facility to exceed five years subject to stated terms and conditions the global credit facility may be used to borrow funds in us dollars or any alternative currency including euros and any other currency that is freely convertible into us dollars approved at the request of the company by the lenders and has a 750 million letter of credit sublimit in addition the global credit facility supports vf’s us commercial paper program for shortterm seasonal working capital requirements and general corporate purposes including acquisitions and share repurchases outstanding shortterm balances may vary from period to period depending on the level of corporate requirements borrowings under the global credit facility are priced at a credit spread of 910 basis points over the appropriate libor benchmark for each currency vf is also required to pay a facility fee to the lenders currently equal to 90 basis points of the committed amount of the facility the credit spread and facility fee are subject to adjustment based on vf’s credit ratings 

vf has restrictive covenants on its global credit facility including a consolidated net indebtedness to consolidated net capitalization financial ratio covenant starting at 70 with future step downs the calculation of consolidated net indebtedness is net of unrestricted cash as of march 2022 the covenant calculation includes cash and equivalents and excludes consolidated operating lease liabilities as of march 2022 vf was in compliance with all covenants 

vf has a commercial paper program that allows for borrowings up to 225 billion to the extent that it has borrowing capacity under the global credit facility there was 3300 million in commercial paper borrowings as of march 2022 standby letters of credit issued as of march 2022 were 243 million leaving approximately 19 billion available for borrowing against the global credit facility at march 2022 additionally vf had approximately 13 billion of cash and equivalents at march 2022

in december 2021 vf completed an early redemption of 5000 million in aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 2050 senior notes due april 2022 the redemption price was equal to the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest discounted to the redemption date at 387 basis points which resulted in a makewhole premium of 32 million 

on april 25 2022 vf repaid the remaining 5000 million in aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 2050 senior notes due april 2022 in accordance with the terms of the notes 

supply chain financing program 

during the three months ended december 2021 vf began offering a voluntary supply chain finance scf program that enables certain suppliers of inventory to leverage vfs credit rating to receive payment from participating financial institutions prior to the payment date specified in the terms between vf and the supplier the transactions are at the sole discretion of both the suppliers and financial institutions and vf is not a party to the agreements the terms between vf and the supplier including the amount due and scheduled payment dates are not impacted by a suppliers participation in the scf program subsequent to the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2022 vf decided to temporarily suspend the scf program to implement certain modifications to the program there were no amounts outstanding under the scf program as of march 2022 in may 2022 the scf program was reinstated in fiscal 2023 amounts due to suppliers who voluntarily participate in the scf program will be included in the accounts payable line item in vfs consolidated balance sheets and all payments made under the scf program will be reflected in cash flows from operating activities in vfs consolidated statements of cash flows 

rating agencies 

vf’s favorable credit agency ratings allow for access to additional liquidity at competitive rates at the end of march 2022 vf’s longterm debt ratings were ‘a’ by standard  poor’s sp global ratings and ‘baa1’ by moody’s investors service both with stable outlooks and commercial paper ratings by those rating agencies were ‘a2’ and ‘p2’ respectively 

none of vf’s longterm debt agreements contain acceleration of maturity clauses based solely on changes in credit ratings however if there were a change in control of vf and as a result of the change in control the notes were rated below investment grade by recognized rating agencies then vf would be obligated to repurchase the notes at 101 of the aggregate principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest if required by the respective holders of the notes the change of control provision applies to all notes except for the 2033 notes 

dividends 

cash dividends totaled 198 per share in fiscal 2022 compared to 194 in fiscal 2021 the dividend payout ratio was 560 of diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2022 compared to 1865 in fiscal 2021 the company has declared a dividend of 050 per share that is payable in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 subject to approval by its board of directors vf intends to continue to pay its regularly scheduled dividend

contractual obligations 

following is a summary of vf’s material contractual obligations and commercial commitments at the end of march 2022 that will require the use of funds 





1 longterm debt consists of required principal payments on longterm debt and finance lease obligations 

2 operating leases represent required lease payments during the noncancelable lease term variable payments for occupancyrelated costs real estate taxes insurance and contingent rent are not included above 

3 interest payment obligations represent required interest payments on longterm debt amounts exclude amortization of debt issuance costs debt discounts and acquisition costs that would be included in interest expense in the consolidated financial statements 

4 inventory obligations represent binding commitments to purchase finished goods and raw materials that are payable upon vf taking ownership of the inventory this obligation excludes the amount included in accounts payable at march 2022 related to inventory purchases 

vf had other financial commitments and contingent obligations at the end of fiscal 2022 that are not included in the above table but may require the use of funds under certain circumstances 

• 1102 million of surety bonds custom bonds standby letters of credit and international bank guarantees are not included in the table above because they represent contingent guarantees of performance under selfinsurance and other programs and would only be drawn upon if vf were to fail to meet its other obligations 

• purchase orders for goods or services in the ordinary course of business are not included in the above table because they represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding commitments 

• as previously reported vf petitioned the us tax court the “court” to resolve an internal revenue service “irs” dispute regarding the timing of income inclusion associated with vf’s acquisition of the timberland company in september 2011 while the irs argues that all such income should have been immediately included in 2011 vf has reported periodic income inclusions in subsequent tax years both parties moved for summary judgment on the issue and on january 31 2022 the court issued its opinion in favor of the irs vf believes the opinion of the court was in error based on the technical merits and intends to appeal however vf will be required to pay the 2011 taxes and interest being disputed or post a surety bond it is anticipated that during fiscal 2023 the irs will assess and vf will pay the 2011 taxes and interest which would be recorded as a tax receivable based on the technical merits of our position with regards to the case the gross amount of taxes and interest as of april 2 2022 was estimated at approximately 8450 million and will continue to accrue interest until paid if vf chooses to post a surety bond in lieu of making the 

payment for tax and interest the cash impact in fiscal 2023 is estimated to be approximately 20 million vf continues to believe its timing and treatment of the income inclusion is appropriate and vf is vigorously defending its position however should the court opinion ultimately be upheld on appeal the tax receivable may not be collected by vf if the court opinion is upheld vf should be entitled to a refund of taxes paid on the periodic inclusions that vf has reported however any such refund could be substantially reduced by potential indirect tax effects resulting from application of the court opinion deferred tax liabilities representing vf’s future tax on annual inclusions would also be released the net impact to tax expense estimated as of april 2 2022 could be up to 7000 million 

management believes that vf’s cash and equivalents balances and expected funds to be provided by operating activities as well as its global credit facility additional borrowing capacity and access to capital markets taken as a whole provide i adequate liquidity to meet all of its current and longterm obligations when due ii adequate liquidity to fund capital expenditures and to maintain the planned dividend and iii flexibility to meet investment opportunities that may arise there continues to be uncertainty about the duration and extent of the impact of covid19 however management believes that vf has sufficient liquidity and flexibility to continue to operate during and after the disruptions caused by the covid19 pandemic and related governmental actions and regulations and health authority advisories and meet its current and longterm obligations as they become due 

vf does not participate in transactions with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships established to facilitate offbalance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes 

vf corporation fiscal 2022 form 10k 35 



vf is exposed to risks in the ordinary course of business management regularly assesses and manages exposures to these risks through operating and financing activities and when appropriate by i taking advantage of natural hedges within vf ii purchasing insurance from commercial carriers or iii using derivative financial instruments some potential risks are discussed below 

insured risks 

vf is selfinsured for a significant portion of its employee medical workers’ compensation vehicle and general liability exposures vf purchases insurance from highlyrated commercial carriers to cover other risks including directors and officers cyber property cargo employment practices wage and hour and umbrella and to establish stoploss limits on selfinsurance arrangements 

cash and equivalents risks 

vf had 13 billion of cash and equivalents at the end of fiscal 2022 management continually monitors the credit ratings of the financial institutions with whom vf conducts business and geopolitical risks that may impact countries where vf has cash balances management also monitors the credit quality of cash equivalents 

defined benefit pension plan risks 

at the end of fiscal 2022 vf’s defined benefit pension plans were overfunded by a net total of 857 million the overfunded status includes a 936 million liability related to our us unfunded supplemental defined benefit plan 205 million of net liabilities related to our nonus defined benefit plans and a 1998 million net asset related to our us qualified defined benefit plan vf will continue to evaluate the funded status and future funding requirements of these plans which depends in part on the future performance of the plans’ investment portfolios management believes that vf has sufficient liquidity to make any required contributions to the pension plans in future years 

vf’s reported earnings are subject to risks due to the volatility of its pension cost income which has ranged in recent years from cost of 236 million in the year ended march 2020 to income of 73 million in the year ended march 2022 these fluctuations are primarily due to differences in the amount of settlement charges recorded in the respective periods the changes are also impacted by varying amounts of actuarial gains and losses that are deferred and amortized to future years’ expense the assumptions that impact actuarial gains and losses include the rate of return on investments held by the pension plans the discount rate used to value participant liabilities and demographic characteristics of the participants 

vf has taken a series of steps to manage the risk and volatility in the pension plans and their impact on the financial statements the us qualified and supplemental defined benefit plans were closed to new entrants at the end of 2004 and all future benefit accruals were frozen as of december 31 2018 during the year ended march 2020 vf offered former employees in the us qualified plan a lumpsum option to receive a distribution of their deferred vested benefits the us qualified plan participants were reduced by 10 as a result of this offer no additional 

funding of the pension plan was required as all distributions were paid out of existing plan assets and the plan’s funded status remained materially unchanged the investment strategy of the us qualified plan continues to define dynamic asset allocation targets that are dependent upon changes in the plan’s funded status capital market expectations and risk tolerance management will continue to evaluate actions that may help to reduce vf’s risks related to its defined benefit plans 

interest rate risks 

vf limits the risk of interest rate fluctuations by managing the mix of fixed and variable interest rate debt in addition vf may use derivative financial instruments to manage risk since all of vf’s longterm debt has fixed interest rates the exposure relates to changes in interest rates on variable rate shortterm borrowings which averaged approximately 640 million at a 21 rate during fiscal 2022 however any change in interest rates would also affect interest income earned on vf’s cash equivalents based on the average amount of variable rate borrowings and cash equivalents during fiscal 2022 the effect of a hypothetical 1 increase in interest rates would be an increase in reported net income of approximately 81 million and a hypothetical 1 decrease in interest rates would be a decrease in reported net income of approximately 83 million 

foreign currency exchange rate risks 

vf is a global enterprise subject to the risk of foreign currency fluctuations approximately 48 of vf’s revenues in the year ended march 2022 were generated in international markets most of vf’s foreign businesses operate in functional currencies other than the us dollar in periods where the us dollar strengthens relative to the euro or other foreign currencies where vf has operations there is a negative impact on vf’s operating results upon translation of those foreign operating results into the us dollar as discussed later in this section management hedges vf’s investments in certain foreign operations and foreign currency transactions 

the reported values of assets and liabilities in these foreign businesses are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for net advances to and investments in vf’s foreign businesses that are considered to be longterm the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on those longterm advances is deferred as a component of accumulated oci in stockholders’ equity the us dollar value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries fluctuates with changes in the underlying functional currencies in february 2020 vf issued €10 billion of eurodenominated fixedrate notes and in september 2016 vf issued €8500 million of eurodenominated fixedrate notes these notes have been designated as net investment hedges of vf’s investment in certain foreign operations because this debt qualified as a nonderivative hedging instrument foreign currency transaction gains or losses of the debt are deferred in the foreign currency translation and other component of accumulated oci as an offset to the foreign currency translation adjustments on the hedged investments any amounts deferred in accumulated oci will remain until the hedged investment is sold or substantially liquidated 

vf monitors net foreign currency market exposures and enters into derivative foreign currency contracts to hedge the effects of exchange rate fluctuations for a significant portion of forecasted 

36 vf corporation fiscal 2022 form 10k 

foreign currency cash flows or specific foreign currency transactions relating to crosscurrency inventory purchases product sales operating costs and intercompany royalty payments vf’s practice is to buy or sell foreign currency exchange contracts that cover up to 80 of foreign currency exposures for periods of up to 24 months currently vf uses only foreign exchange forward contracts but may use options or collars in the future this use of financial instruments allows management to reduce the overall exposure to risks from exchange rate fluctuations on vf’s cash flows and earnings since gains and losses on these contracts will offset losses and gains on the transactions being hedged 

for cash flow hedging contracts outstanding at the end of fiscal 2022 a hypothetical 10 decrease and 10 increase in foreign currency exchange rates compared to rates at the end of fiscal 2022 would result in an increase in the unrealized net gain of approximately 74 million and a decrease in the unrealized net gain of approximately 58 million respectively however any change in the fair value of the hedging contracts would be substantially offset by a change in the fair value of the underlying hedged exposure impacted by the currency rate changes 

counterparty risks 

vf is exposed to creditrelated losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to derivative hedging instruments to manage this risk we have established counterparty credit guidelines and only enter into derivative transactions with financial institutions that have ‘a minusa3’ 

investment grade credit ratings or better vf continually monitors the credit rating of and limits the amount hedged with each counterparty additionally management utilizes a portfolio of financial institutions to minimize exposure to potential counterparty defaults and adjusts positions as necessary vf also monitors counterparty risk for derivative contracts within the defined benefit pension plans 

commodity price risks 

vf is exposed to market risks for the pricing of cotton leather rubber wool and other materials primarily due to the impact on the cost of sourced finished goods from independent contractors to manage risks of commodity price changes management negotiates prices of finished goods in advance when possible vf has not historically managed commodity price exposures by using derivative instruments 

deferred compensation and related investment security risks 

vf has nonqualified deferred compensation plans in which liabilities to the plans’ participants are based on the market values of the participants’ selection of a hypothetical portfolio of investment funds vf invests in a portfolio of securities that substantially mirrors the participants’ investment selections the increases and decreases in deferred compensation liabilities are substantially offset by corresponding increases and decreases in the market value of vf’s investments resulting in an insignificant net exposure to operating results and financial position 



vf has chosen accounting policies that management believes are appropriate to accurately and fairly report vf’s operating results and financial position in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us vf applies these accounting policies in a consistent manner significant accounting policies are summarized in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

the application of these accounting policies requires that vf make estimates and assumptions about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses contingent assets and liabilities and related disclosures these estimates assumptions and judgments are based on historical experience current trends and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis because vf’s business cycle 

is relatively short ie from the date that inventory is received until that inventory is sold and the trade receivable is collected actual results related to most estimates are known within a few months after any balance sheet date in addition vf may retain outside specialists to assist in valuations of business acquisitions and impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets if actual results ultimately differ from previous estimates the revisions are included in results of operations when the actual amounts become known 

vf believes the following accounting policies involve the most significant management estimates assumptions and judgments used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements or are the most sensitive to change from outside factors the application of these critical accounting policies and estimates is discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors 



vf accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting under the acquisition method the consolidated financial statements reflect the operations of an acquired business starting from the closing date of the acquisition all assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date vf allocates the purchase price of an acquired business to the fair values of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed with any excess purchase price recorded as goodwill contingent consideration if any is included within the purchase price and is recognized at its fair value on the acquisition date 

the application of the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations and determination of fair value requires management to make judgments and may involve the use of significant estimates including assumptions related to estimated future revenues growth rates cash flows discount rates and royalty rates among other items vf generally evaluates fair value at acquisition using three valuation techniques  the replacement cost market and income methods  and weights the valuation methods based on what is most appropriate in the circumstances the process of assigning fair values particularly to acquired intangible assets is highly subjective vf also typically utilizes thirdparty valuation 

vf corporation fiscal 2022 form 10k 37 

specialists to assist management in the determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed management estimates of fair value are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable but are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result actual results may differ from estimates if the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be exposed to potential impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill as discussed in the longlived assets including intangible assets and goodwill section below 

during the measurement period which is up to one year from the acquisition date adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed may be recorded with the corresponding offset to goodwill 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 vf completed the acquisition of supreme holdings inc supreme for 24 billion management allocated the purchase price of the acquired supreme business to the estimated fair values of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities at the date of acquisition which resulted in excess purchase price of 125 billion that was recorded as goodwill the acquired assets included the estimated fair value of 120 billion for the supreme ® trademark which is an identifiable intangible asset 

management believes to have an indefinite life the estimated fair value of the supreme ® trademark was determined using the relieffromroyalty method of the income valuation approach which required the use of significant estimates and assumptions including future revenues growth rates royalty rate tax rates and discount rate associated with the acquired intangible asset managements estimates and assumptions utilized internal forecasts of supremes future business performance and relevant market information management also utilized a thirdparty valuation specialist to assist in the determination of the estimated fair value of the supreme ® trademark 

management believes the assumptions used in determining the estimated fair value of the supreme ® trademark were reasonable but are inherently uncertain and unpredictable as a result actual results may differ from estimates refer to the longlived assets including intangible assets and goodwill section below for additional discussion regarding impairment considerations during fiscal 2022 related to the supreme reporting unit goodwill and indefinitelived trademark intangible asset 

refer to note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the supreme acquisition 



definitelived assets 

vf’s depreciation policies for property plant and equipment reflect judgments on the estimated economic lives and residual values if any vf’s amortization policies for definitelived intangible assets reflect judgments on the estimated amounts and duration of future cash flows expected to be generated by those assets in evaluating the amortizable life for customer relationship intangible assets management considers historical attrition patterns for various groups of customers in determining the lease term used to amortize operating lease rightofuse assets vf considers initial terms and any renewal or termination options that may exist when deemed reasonably certain the renewal and termination options are included in the determination of lease term 

vf’s policy is to review property plant and equipment definitelived intangible assets and operating lease rightofuse assets for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable vf tests for potential impairment at the asset or asset group level which is the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent vf measures recoverability of the carrying value of an asset or asset group by comparison to the estimated pretax undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if the forecasted pretax undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset are not expected to be adequate to recover the asset’s carrying value a fair value analysis must be performed and an impairment charge is recorded if there is an excess of the asset’s carrying value over its estimated fair value 

when testing property plant and equipment for potential impairment vf uses the incomebased discounted cash flow method using the estimated cash flows of the respective asset or asset group the estimated pretax undiscounted cash flows of the asset or asset group through the end of its useful life are compared to its carrying value if the pretax undiscounted cash 

flows of the asset or asset group exceed its carrying value there is no impairment charge if the pretax undiscounted cash flows of the asset or asset group are less than its carrying value the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group is calculated based on the aftertax discounted cash flows using an appropriate weighted average cost of capital wacc and an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group and its carrying value 

when testing customer relationship intangible assets for potential impairment management considers historical customer attrition rates and projected revenues and profitability related to customers that existed at acquisition management uses the multiperiod excess earnings method which is a specific application of the discounted cash flow method to value customer relationship assets the estimated pretax undiscounted cash flows of the asset through the end of its useful life are compared to its carrying value if the pretax undiscounted cash flows of the asset exceed its carrying value there is no impairment charge if the pretax undiscounted cash flows of the asset are less than its carrying value the estimated fair value of the asset is calculated based on the present value of the aftertax cash flows expected to be generated by the customer relationship asset after deducting contributory asset charges and an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value of the asset and its carrying value 

when testing operating lease rightofuse assets for potential impairment vf uses the incomebased discounted cash flow method using the estimated cash flows of the respective asset or asset group the estimated pretax undiscounted cash flows of the asset or asset group through the end of its useful life are compared to its carrying value if the pretax undiscounted cash flows of the asset exceed its carrying value there is no impairment charge if the pretax undiscounted cash flows of the asset or asset group are less than its carrying value the 

38 vf corporation fiscal 2022 form 10k 

estimated fair value of the asset or asset group is calculated considering what a market participant would pay to lease the asset for its highest and best use and an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group and its carrying value the impairment loss is allocated to the longlived assets of the group on a prorata basis using the relative carrying amounts of those assets 

indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill 

fair value for acquired intangible assets is generally based on the present value of expected cash flows indefinitelived trademark or trade name intangible assets collectively referred to herein as “trademarks” represent individually acquired trademarks some of which are registered in multiple countries goodwill represents the excess of cost of an acquired business over the fair values of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed and is assigned at the reporting unit level 

vf’s policy is to evaluate indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill for possible impairment as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of such assets may be below their carrying amount as part of its annual impairment testing vf may elect to assess qualitative factors as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform quantitative impairment testing if management’s assessment of these qualitative factors indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset or reporting unit is more than its carrying value then no further testing is required otherwise the intangible asset or reporting unit must be quantitatively tested for impairment 

an indefinitelived intangible asset is quantitatively tested for possible impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value fair value of an indefinitelived trademark is based on an income approach using the relieffromroyalty method under this method forecasted revenues for products sold with the trademark are assigned a royalty rate that would be charged to license the trademark in lieu of ownership and the estimated fair value is calculated as the present value of those forecasted royalties avoided by owning the trademark the discount rate is based on the reporting unit’s wacc that considers market participant assumptions and is adjusted as appropriate to factor in the risk of the intangible asset the royalty rate is selected based on consideration of i royalty rates included in active license agreements if applicable ii royalty rates received by market participants in the apparel industry and iii the current performance of the reporting unit if the estimated fair value of the trademark intangible asset exceeds its carrying value there is no impairment charge if the estimated fair value of the trademark is less than its carrying value an impairment charge would be recognized for the difference 

goodwill is quantitatively evaluated for possible impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value reporting units are businesses with discrete financial information that is available and reviewed by management 

for goodwill impairment testing vf estimates the fair value of a reporting unit using both incomebased and marketbased valuation methods the incomebased approach is based on the reporting unit’s forecasted future cash flows that are discounted 

to present value using the reporting unit’s wacc as discussed above for the marketbased approach management uses both the guideline company and similar transaction methods the guideline company method analyzes market multiples of revenues and earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” for a group of comparable public companies the market multiples used in the valuation are based on the relative strengths and weaknesses of the reporting unit compared to the selected guideline companies under the similar transactions method valuation multiples are calculated utilizing actual transaction prices and revenueebitda data from target companies deemed similar to the reporting unit 

based on the range of estimated fair values developed from the income and marketbased methods vf determines the estimated fair value for the reporting unit if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value the goodwill is not impaired and no further review is required however if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value vf calculates the impairment loss as the difference between the carrying value of the reporting unit and the estimated fair value 

the incomebased fair value methodology requires management’s assumptions and judgments regarding economic conditions in the markets in which vf operates and conditions in the capital markets many of which are outside of management’s control at the reporting unit level fair value estimation requires management’s assumptions and judgments regarding the effects of overall economic conditions on the specific reporting unit along with assessment of the reporting unit’s strategies and forecasts of future cash flows forecasts of individual reporting unit cash flows involve management’s estimates and assumptions regarding 

• annual cash flows on a debtfree basis arising from future revenues and profitability changes in working capital capital spending and income taxes for at least a 10year forecast period 

• a terminal growth rate for years beyond the forecast period the terminal growth rate is selected based on consideration of growth rates used in the forecast period historical performance of the reporting unit and economic conditions 

• a discount rate that reflects the risks inherent in realizing the forecasted cash flows a discount rate considers the riskfree rate of return on longterm treasury securities the risk premium associated with investing in equity securities of comparable companies the beta obtained from comparable companies and the cost of debt for investment grade issuers in addition the discount rate may consider any companyspecific risk in achieving the prospective financial information 

under the marketbased fair value methodology judgment is required in evaluating market multiples and recent transactions management believes that the assumptions used for its impairment tests are representative of those that would be used by market participants performing similar valuations of vf’s reporting units 

fiscal 2022 impairment testing 

management performed its annual goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment testing as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 vf elected to bypass the qualitative 

vf corporation fiscal 2022 form 10k 39 

analysis for the supreme reporting unit goodwill and indefinitelived trademark intangible asset see additional discussion in the supreme reporting unit and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment analysis section below management performed a qualitative analysis for all other reporting units and trademark intangible assets as discussed below in the “other reporting units  qualitative impairment analysis” section 

supreme reporting unit and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment analysis 

in conjunction with vfs annual goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment testing as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 management performed a quantitative impairment analysis of the supreme reporting unit goodwill and indefinitelived trademark intangible asset the decision to bypass the optional qualitative impairment assessment and proceed directly to a quantitative impairment analysis was primarily based on fiscal 2022 financial results falling below estimates used in the initial business combination valuation and the overall significance of the related assets based on the quantitative impairment analysis management concluded the goodwill and indefinitelived trademark intangible asset were not impaired the estimated fair values of the reporting unit and indefinitelived trademark intangible asset exceeded the carrying values by 5 and 3 respectively the carrying values of the reporting unit goodwill and indefinitelived trademark intangible asset at the january 2 2022 testing date were 124 billion and 119 billion respectively 

supreme is a global streetwear leader that sells apparel accessories and footwear under its namesake brand supreme ®  products are sold globally through vfoperated stores and online the supreme reporting unit is included in the active reportable segment 

managements revenue and profitability forecasts used in the supreme reporting unit and indefinitelived trademark intangible asset valuations considered historical performance strategic initiatives and industry trends assumptions used in the valuations were similar to those that would be used by market participants performing independent valuations of the business 

key assumptions developed by management and used in the quantitative analysis of the supreme reporting unit and indefinitelived trademark intangible asset include 

• financial projections and future cash flows including a base year reflecting actual results lower than the forecast used in the initial business combination valuation primarily driven by the impact of shortterm supply chain disruptions in fiscal 2022 revenue growth and profitability improvement throughout the forecast period that reflects the longterm strategy for the business which is unchanged from the business combination valuation and terminal growth rates based on the expected longterm growth rate of the business 

• tax rates based on the statutory rates for the countries in which the brand operates and the related intellectual property is domiciled which consider intellectual property transfers completed by the company during fiscal 2022 that resulted in lower tax rates when compared to the business combination valuation assumptions 

• royalty rates based on market data as well as active license agreements with similar vf brands which are 

consistent with the business combination valuation assumptions and 

• marketbased discount rates 

the valuation model used by management in the impairment testing assumes revenue growth and profitability improvement including recovery from the supply chain disruption in fiscal 2022 and execution of its longterm growth strategy if the brand is unable to achieve the financial projections an impairment of the indefinitelived trademark intangible asset or the reporting unit goodwill could occur in the future 

management performed sensitivity analyses on the impairment models used to test the supreme reporting unit goodwill and indefinitelived trademark intangible asset in doing so management determined that individual changes of a 10 decrease in the compound annual growth rate for ebitda or a 50 basispoint increase in the discount rate used in the discounted cash flow model resulted in the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to be below its carrying value which would result in impairment management also determined that individual changes of a 10 decrease in the compound annual growth rate for revenues or a 50 basispoint increase in the discount rate used in the relieffromroyalty model resulted in the estimated fair value of the indefinitelived trademark intangible asset to be below its carrying value which would result in impairment 

other reporting units  qualitative impairment analysis 

for all other reporting units vf elected to perform a qualitative assessment during the annual goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment testing to determine whether it was more likely than not that the goodwill and indefinitelived trademark intangible assets in those reporting units were impaired in this qualitative assessment vf considered relevant events and circumstances for each reporting unit including i current year results and performance versus managements annual and strategic plans ii financial outlook based on the latest strategic plan iii changes in the reporting unit carrying value since prior year and the amounts relative to the size of the respective business iv industry and market conditions in which the reporting unit operates v macroeconomic conditions including discount rate changes and vi changes in products or services offered by the reporting unit if applicable performance in recent years was compared to forecasts included in prior valuations based on the results of the qualitative assessment vf concluded it was more likely than not the carrying values of the goodwill and indefinitelived trademark intangible assets were less than their fair values and that further quantitative testing was not necessary 

management’s use of estimates and assumptions 

management made its estimates based on information available as of the date of our assessments using assumptions we believe market participants would use in performing an independent valuation of the business it is possible that vf’s conclusions regarding impairment of goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets in any reporting unit could change in future periods there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions used in our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment testing will prove to be accurate predictions of the future if for example i the businesses do not perform as projected ii overall economic conditions in fiscal 2023 or future years vary from current assumptions including changes 

40 vf corporation fiscal 2022 form 10k 

in discount rates iii business conditions or strategies for a specific reporting unit change from current assumptions including loss of major customers iv investors require higher rates of return on equity investments in the marketplace or v enterprise values of comparable publicly traded companies or actual sales transactions of comparable companies were to decline resulting in lower multiples of revenues and ebitda 

a future impairment charge for goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets could have a material effect on vf’s consolidated financial position and results of operations 



as a global company vf is subject to income taxes and files income tax returns in over 100 us and foreign jurisdictions each year due to economic and political conditions tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change the company could be subject to changes in its tax rates the adoption of new us or international tax legislation or changes in interpretation of existing tax laws and regulations or rulings by courts or government authorities leading to exposure to additional tax liabilities in particular tax authorities and the courts have increased their focus on income earned in no or lowtax jurisdictions or income that is not taxed in any jurisdiction tax authorities have also become skeptical of special tax rulings provided to companies offering lower taxes than may be applicable in other countries vf makes an ongoing assessment to identify any significant exposure related to increases in tax rates in the jurisdictions in which vf operates 

furthermore vf was granted a ruling which lowered the effective income tax rate on taxable earnings for years 2010 through 2014 under belgiums excess profit tax regime during 2015 the european union commission “eu” investigated and announced its decision that these rulings were illegal and ordered the tax benefits to be collected from affected companies including vf requests for annulment were filed by belgium and vf europe bvba individually during 2017 and 2018 vf europe bvba was assessed and paid €350 million tax and interest which was recorded as an income tax receivable based on the expected success of the requests for annulment during 2019 the general court annulled the eu decision and the eu subsequently appealed the general court’s annulment in september 2021 the general courts judgment was set aside by the court of justice of the eu and the case was sent back to the general court to determine whether the excess profit tax regime amounted to illegal state aid the case remains open and unresolved if this matter is adversely resolved these amounts will not be collected by vf 

the calculation of income tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations which are subject to legal interpretation and significant management judgment vf’s income tax returns are regularly examined by federal state and foreign tax authorities and those audits may result in proposed adjustments vf has reviewed all issues raised upon examination as well as any exposure for issues that may be raised in future examinations vf has evaluated these potential issues under the “morelikelythannot” standard of the accounting literature a tax position is recognized if it meets this standard and is measured at the largest amount of benefit 

that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized such judgments and estimates may change based on audit settlements court cases and interpretation of tax laws and regulations income tax expense could be materially affected to the extent vf prevails in a tax position or when the statute of limitations expires for a tax position for which a liability for unrecognized tax benefits or valuation allowances has been established or to the extent vf is required to pay amounts greater than the established liability for unrecognized tax benefits under the morelikelythannot standard vf does not currently anticipate any material impact on earnings from the ultimate resolution of income tax uncertainties there are no accruals for general or unknown tax expenses 

as previously reported vf petitioned the us tax court the “court” to resolve an internal revenue service irs dispute regarding the timing of income inclusion associated with vf’s acquisition of the timberland company in september 2011 while the irs argues that all such income should have been immediately included in 2011 vf has reported periodic income inclusions in subsequent tax years both parties moved for summary judgment on the issue and on january 31 2022 the court issued its opinion in favor of the irs vf believes the opinion of the court was in error based on the technical merits and intends to appeal vf continues to believe its timing and treatment of the income inclusion is appropriate and vf is vigorously defending its position no impact of the court opinion has been recorded in the consolidated financial statements based on our assessment of the position under the morelikelythannot standard 

as of march 2022 vf had 6790 million of gross deferred income tax assets related to operating loss and capital loss carryforwards and 6085 million of valuation allowances against those assets realization of deferred tax assets related to operating loss and capital loss carryforwards is dependent on future taxable income in specific jurisdictions the amount and timing of which are uncertain and on possible changes in tax laws if management believes that vf will not be able to generate sufficient taxable income or capital gains to offset losses during the carryforward periods vf records valuation allowances to reduce those deferred tax assets to amounts expected to be ultimately realized if in a future period management determines that the amount of deferred tax assets to be realized differs from the net recorded amount vf would record an adjustment to income tax expense in that future period

wholesale customers due to increased brand awareness education and visibility vfoperated fullprice stores generally provide gross margins that are well above vf averages 

in addition vf operates outlet stores in both premium outlet malls and more traditional valuebased locations these outlet stores carry merchandise that is specifically designed for sale in our outlet stores and serve an important role in our overall inventory management and profitability by allowing vf to sell a significant portion of excess discontinued and outofseason products at better prices than otherwise available from outside parties while maintaining the integrity of our brands

our global directtoconsumer operations included 1374 stores at the end of fiscal 2021 we operate retail store locations for the following brands vans ®  timberland ®  the north face ®  kipling ®  dickies ®  icebreaker ®  napapijri ® and supreme ®  approximately 56 of our stores are located in the americas region 49 in the us 24 in the europe region and 20 in the asiapacific region we opened 80 stores concentrating on the brands with the highest retail growth potential vans ® and the north fac e ®  and acquired 12 suprem e ® brand stores during fiscal 2021  additionally we have approximately 900 concession retail stores located principally in europe and asia vfoperated retail stores across the globe were signific antly impacted during fiscal 2021 due to temporary closures for varying periods of time in response to the novel coronavirus covid19 pandemic the majority of vfoperated retail stores were open by the end of the second quarter however certain stores reclosed during the third and fourth quarters based on guidance from health advisors and governmental actions and regulations which primarily impacted the europe region and north america at the end of fiscal 2021 approximately 60 of vfoperated retail stores were closed in the europe region and less than 5 of stores were closed in north america in the asiapacific region nearly all vfoperated retail stores remained open 

ecommerce represented approximately 50 of our directtoconsumer business in fiscal 2021 all vf brands are marketed online we continue to expand our ecommerce initiatives by rolling out additional countryspecific brand sites in europe and asia which enhances our ability to deliver a superior localized consumer experience we also continue to increase focus on digital innovation and growth across other thirdparty digital platforms changes in the retail landscape resulting from the covid19 pandemic have accelerated our ecommerce growth 

we expect our directtoconsumer business to continue growing as we accelerate our consumerminded retailcentric hyperdigital business model transformation 

in addition to our directtoconsumer operations independent parties own and operate approximately 2900 partnership stores these are primarily monobrand retail locations selling vf products that have the appearance of vfoperated stores most of these partnership stores are located in europe and asia and are concentrated in the timberland ®  the north face ®  vans ®  dickies ®  kipling ® and napapijri ® brands 



as part of our strategy of expanding market penetration of vfowned brands we enter into licensing agreements with independent parties for specific apparel and complementary product categories when such arrangements provide more effective manufacturing distribution and marketing than could be achieved internally we provide support to these business partners and ensure the integrity of our brand names by taking an active role in the design quality control advertising marketing and distribution of licensed products 

licensing arrangements relate to a broad range of vf brands and are for fixed terms of generally 3 to 5 years with conditional renewal options each licensee pays royalties to vf based on its sales of licensed products with most agreements providing for a minimum royalty requirement royalties generally range f rom 4 to 10 of the licensing partners’ net licensed products sales royalty income was 517 million in fiscal 2021 less than 1 of total revenues primarily from the vans ®  dickies ® and timberland ® brands 



product design and innovation including fit fabric finish and quality are important elements across our businesses these functions are performed by employees located in our global supply chain organization and our branded business units across the globe 

vf’s centralized global supply chain organization is responsible for producing procuring and delivering products to our customers vf is highly skilled in managing the complexities associated with our global supply chain  in fiscal 2021 vf sourced or produced approximately 295 million units spread across our brands our products were primarily obtained from approximately 265 independent contractor manufacturing facilities in approximately 36 countries additionally we operate 29 distribution centers and 1374 retail stores managing this complexity is made possible by the use of a network of information systems for product development forecasting order management and warehouse management along with our core enterprise resource management platforms 

in fiscal 2021 96 of our units were obtained from independent contractors products obtained f rom contractors in the western hemisphere generally have a higher cost than products obtained from contractors in asia however contracting in the western hemisphere gives us greater flexibility shorter lead times and allows for lower inventory levels for the us market the use of 

contracted production with different geographic regions and cost structures provides a flexible approach to product sourcing we will continue to manage our supply chain from a global perspective and adjust as needed to changes in the global production environment 

independent contractors generally own the raw materials and ship finished readyforsale products to vf these contractors are engaged through vf sourcing hubs in hong kong with satellite offices across asia and panama these hubs are responsible for managing the manufacturing and procurement of product supplier oversight product quality assurance sustainability within the supply chain responsible sourcing and transportation and shipping functions in addition our hubs leverage proprietary knowledge and technology to enable certain contractors to more effectively control costs and improve labor efficiency 

management continually monitors political risks and developments related to duties tariffs and quotas we limit vf’s sourcing exposure through among other measures i diversifying production among countries and contractors ii sourcing production to merchandise categories where product is readily available and iii sourcing from countries with tariff preference and free trade agreements vf does not directly

table of conte nts 

or indirectly source products from suppliers in countries that are prohibited by the us state department 

no single supplier represented more than 7 of our total cost of goods sold during fiscal 2021 

the independent contractor facilities that manufacture vf products must comply with vf’s global compliance principles these principles established in 1997 and consistent with international labor standards are a set of strict standards covering legal and ethical business practices worker age work hours health and safety conditions environmental standards and compliance with local laws and regulations 

vf through its contractor monitoring program audits the activities of the independent businesses and contractors that produce vf products at locations across the globe each of the approximately 265 independent contractor facilities including those serving our independent licensees must be precertified before producing vf products this precertification includes passing a factory inspection and signing a vf terms of engagement agreement we maintain an ongoing audit program to ensure compliance with these requirements by using dedicated internal staff and externally contracted firms additional information about vf’s code of business conduct global compliance principles terms of engagement and environmental compliance guidelines along with a global compliance report is available on the vf website at wwwvfccom 

in response to covid19 vf has actively worked with its suppliers to minimize disruption while comply ing with local health advisories and governmental restrictions vf did not experience significant difficulty in fulfilling its raw material and contracting production needs during fiscal 2021 absent any material changes vf believes it would be able to largel y offset any increases in product costs through i the continuing shift in the mix of its business to higher margin brands geographies and channels of distribution ii increases in the prices of its products and iii cost reduction efforts the loss of any one supplier or contractor would not have a significant adverse effect on our business 

product is shipped from our independent suppliers to distribution centers around the world in some instances product is shipped directly to our customers most distribution centers are operated by vf and some support more than one brand a portion of our distribution needs are met by contract distribution centers in response to covid19 vfs distribution centers have maintained operations in accordance with local government guidelines while maintaining enhanced health and safety protocols 

our largest fully operational distribution centers by region are located in visalia california prague czech republic and shanghai china in total we operate 29 owned or leased distribution centers primarily in the us but also in the united kingdom belgium the netherlands canada mexico israel japan and france 



vf’s quarterly operating results vary due to the seasonality of our individual brands and are historically stronger in the second half of the calendar year this variation results primarily from the seasonal influences on revenues of our outdoor segment where revenues are historically weighted towards the second and third fiscal quarters our fiscal 2021 results were also significantly impacted by covid19 which resulted in temporary store closures reduced traffic and changes in consumer behavior with changes in our mix of business and the growth of our retail operations historical quarterly revenue and profit trends may not be indicative of future trends 

working capital requirements vary throughout the year working capital typically increases early in the calendar year as inventory builds to support peak shipping periods and then moderates later in the year as those inventories are sold and accounts receivable are collected historically cash provided by operating activities is substantially higher in the second half of the calendar year due to higher net income during that period and reduced working capital requirements particularly during the fourth quarter of the calendar year 



during fiscal 2021 our advertising and promotion expense was 6081 million representing 7 of total revenues we advertise in consumer and trade publications on radio and television and through digital initiatives including social media and mobile platforms on the internet we also participate in cooperative advertising on a shared cost basis with major retailers in print and digital media radio and television we sponsor sporting musical and special events as well as athletes and personalities who promote our products we employ marketing sciences to optimize the impact of advertising and promotional spending and to identify the types of spending that provide the greatest return on our marketing investments 

we provide advertising support to our wholesale customers including independent partnership stores in the form of pointofsale fixtures and signage to enhance the presentation and brand image of our products we also participate in shopinshops and concession retail arrangements which are separate 

sales areas dedicated to a specific vf brand within our customers stores and other locations to help differentiate and enhance the presentation of our products 

we contribute to incentive programs with our wholesale customers including cooperative advertising funds discounts and allowances we also offer sales incentive programs directly to consumers in the form of discounts rebates and coupon offers that are eligible for use in certain vfoperated stores brand ecommerce sites and concession retail locations 

in addition to sponsorships and activities that directly benefit our products and brands vf and its associates actively support our communities and various charities for example the north face ® brand has committed to programs that encourage and enable outdoor participation such as the north face endurance challenge ® and the north face explore fund™ programs the timberland ® brand has a strong heritage of volunteerism including the path of service™ program that offers fulltime

 item 1a risk factors 

tableend

the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating vf’s business and the forwardlooking statements contained in this form 10k any of the following risks could materially adversely affect vf’s business its operating results and its financial condition 



vf’s revenues and profits depend on the level of consumer spending for apparel and footwear which is sensitive to global economic conditions and other factors a decline in consumer spending could have a material adverse effect on vf 

the success of vf’s business depends on consumer spending on apparel and footwear and there are a number of factors that influence consumer spending including actual and perceived economic conditions disposable consumer income interest rates consumer credit availability unemployment stock market performance weather conditions energy prices public health issues including the covid19 pandemic consumer discretionary spending patterns and tax rates in the international national regional and local markets where vf’s products are sold decreased consumer spending could result in reduced demand for our products reduced orders from customers for our products order cancellations lower revenues higher discounts increased inventories and lower gross margins the uncertain state of the global economy continues to impact businesses around the world most acutely in emerging markets and developing economies if global economic and financial market conditions do not improve adverse economic trends or other factors could negatively impact the level of consumer spending which could have a material adverse impact on vf 

the coronavirus covid19 pandemic has and will continue to materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business has been and will continue to be impacted by the effects of the covid19 pandemic in countries and territories where we operate and our employees suppliers thirdparty service providers consumers or customers are located these effects include recommendations or mandates from governmental authorities to close businesses require staged reopening limit travel prevent large gatherings and require individuals to follow selfquarantine curfew shelterinplace and stayathome orders the countries and territories in which our products are made manufactured distributed or sold are in varying stages of restrictions and reopening to address the covid19 pandemic certain jurisdictions have begun reopening following precautionary measures such as limited operating hours and limited occupancy levels only to return to further restrictions and closures in the face of a rising number of covid19 cases there is significant uncertainty around retail store openings and the extent to which stores may remain open if and where there is a resurgence in covid19 and the duration and severity of any related restrictions some of the impacts of the covid19 pandemic on our business have included and could continue to include the following 

• significant reductions in demand and significant volatility in demand for our products by consumers and customers resulting in reduced orders order cancellations lower revenues higher discounts increased inventories decreased value of inventories and lower gross margins which continue to be caused by among other things the 

inability of consumers to purchase our products due to illness quarantine or other restrictions or out of fear of exposure to covid19 phased reopenings and reclosures of our owned stores as well as stores of our customers or reduced store hours across the americas europe and asiapacific regions due to a resurgence of covid19 significant declines in consumer retail store traffic to stores that have reopened or financial hardship and unemployment shifts in demand away from consumer discretionary products and reduced options for marketing and promotion of products or other restrictions in connection with the covid19 pandemic 

• significant uncertainty and turmoil in global economic and financial market conditions causing among other things decreased consumer confidence and decreased consumer spending now and in the mid and longterm inability to access financing in the credit and capital markets including the commercial paper market at reasonable rates or at all in the event we our customers or suppliers find it desirable to do so increased exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar and volatility in the availability and prices for commodities and raw materials we use for our products and in our supply chain 

• inability to meet our consumers’ and customers’ needs for inventory production and fulfillment due to disruptions in our supply chain and increased costs associated with mitigating the effects of the pandemic caused by among other things reduction or loss of workforce due to illness quarantine or other restrictions or facility closures scarcity of andor increased prices for raw materials scrutiny or embargoing of goods produced in infected areas and increased freight and logistics costs expenses and times failure of third parties on which we rely including our suppliers customers distributors service providers and commercial banks to meet their obligations to us or to timely meet those obligations or significant disruptions in their ability to do so which may be caused by their own financial or operational difficulties including business failure or insolvency and collectability of existing receivables 

• significant changes in the conditions in markets in which we do business including quarantines governmental or regulatory actions closures or other restrictions including voluntarily adopted practices that limit or close our operating and manufacturing facilities and restrict our employees’ ability to perform necessary business functions including operations necessary for the design development production distribution sale marketing and support of our products and increase the likelihood of litigation 

• increased costs including increased employee costs such as for expanded benefits and essential employee incentives and increased operating costs including those associated with provision of personal protective

table of conte nts 

equipment and compliance with governmental or public health organization mandates or guidance allowances or extended payment terms for customers and inventory writeoffs all of which have negatively impacted our profitability 

• increased risk to the health safety and wellness including mental and emotional health of our employees due to the virus or the impact of related restrictions and 

• amplified data security risks as a result of more employees working remotely including increased demand on our information technology resources and systems increased phishing and other cybersecurity attacks and an increase in the number of points of potential attack such as laptops and mobile devices 

these impacts have placed and will continue to place limitations on our ability to execute our business plan and materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations we continue to monitor the situation and may adjust our current policies and procedures as more information and guidance become available regarding the evolving situation the impact of covid19 may also exacerbate other risks discussed in this “risk factors” section any of which could have a material effect on us the extent of the impact of the covid19 pandemic will depend on future developments including the duration severity and any resurgences of covid19 which are uncertain and cannot be predicted this situation is dynamic and changing rapidly and additional impacts may arise that we are not aware of currently 

the apparel and footwear industries are highly competitive and vf’s success depends on its ability to gauge consumer preferences and product trends and to respond to constantly changing markets 

vf competes with numerous apparel and footwear brands and manufacturers competition is generally based upon brand name recognition price design product quality selection service and purchasing convenience some of our competitors are larger and have more resources than vf in some product categories and regions in addition vf competes directly with the private label brands of its wholesale customers vf’s ability to compete within the apparel and footwear industries depends on our ability to 

• anticipate and respond to changing consumer preferences and product trends in a timely manner 

• develop attractive innovative and high quality products that meet consumer needs 

• maintain strong brand recognition 

• price products appropriately 

• provide bestinclass marketing support and intelligence 

• ensure product availability and optimize supply chain efficiencies 

• obtain sufficient retail store space and effectively present our products at retail 

• produce or procure quality products on a consistent basis and 

• adapt to a more digitally driven consumer landscape 

failure to compete effectively or to keep pace with rapidly changing consumer preferences markets technology business 

model and product trends could have a material adverse effect on vf’s business financial condition and results of operations moreover there are significant shifts underway in the wholesale and retail ecommerce and retail store channels which have been accelerated because of the covid19 pandemic vf may not be able to manage its brands within and across channels sufficiently which could have a material adverse effect on vf’s business financial condition and results of operations 

the retail industry has experienced financial difficulty that could adversely affect vfs business 

recently there have been consolidations reorganizations restructurings bankruptcies and ownership changes in the retail industry in addition the covid19 pandemic has resulted in closed stores and reduced consumer traffic and purchasing as governments impose mandatory business closures and similar measures to curtail the spread of the disease and consumers limit shopping due to illness or to avoid exposure these events individually and together could have and in the case of the covid19 pandemic have had a material adverse effect on vfs business these changes could impact vf’s opportunities in the market and increase vf’s reliance on a smaller number of large customers in the future retailers are likely to further consolidate undergo restructurings or reorganizations or bankruptcies realign their affiliations or reposition their stores’ target markets in addition consumers have continued to transition away from traditional wholesale retailers to large online retailers these developments could result in a reduction in the number of stores that carry vf’s products an increase in ownership concentration within the retail industry an increase in credit exposure to vf or an increase in leverage by vf’s customers over their suppliers 

further the global economy periodically experiences recessionary conditions with rising unemployment reduced availability of credit increased savings rates and declines in real estate and securities values these recessionary conditions including as a result of the current covid19 pandemic could have a negative impact on retail sales of apparel and other consumer products the lower sales volumes along with the possibility of restrictions on access to the credit markets could result in our customers experiencing financial difficulties including store closures bankruptcies or liquidations this could result in higher credit risk to vf relating to receivables from our customers who are experiencing these financial difficulties if these developments occur our inability to shift sales to other customers or to collect on vf’s trade accounts receivable could have a material adverse effect on vf’s financial condition and results of operations 

vf’s profitability may decline as a result of increasing pressure on margins 

the apparel industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors including intense competition consolidation in the retail industry rising commodity and conversion costs pressure from retailers to reduce the costs of products changes in consumer demand and shifts to online shopping and purchasing consumers may increasingly seek markdown allowances incentives and other forms of economic support if these factors cause us to reduce our sales prices to retailers and consumers and we fail to sufficiently reduce our product costs or operating expenses vf’s profitability will decline this could have a material adverse effect on vf’s results of operations liquidity and financial condition

table of conte nts 



vf’s business and the success of its products could be harmed if vf is unable to maintain the images of its brands 

vf’s success to date has been due in large part to the growth of its brands’ images and vf’s customers’ connection to its brands if we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to changing consumer demand the names and images of our brands may be impaired even if we react appropriately to changes in consumer preferences consumers may consider our brands’ images to be outdated or associate our brands with styles that are no longer popular in addition brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of qualities including merchandise quality and corporate integrity negative claims or publicity regarding vf its brands or its products including licensed products could adversely affect our reputation and sales regardless of whether such claims are accurate social media which accelerates the dissemination of information can increase the challenges of responding to negative claims in the past many apparel companies have experienced periods of rapid growth in sales and earnings followed by periods of declining sales and losses our businesses may be similarly affected in the future in addition we have sponsorship contracts with a number of athletes musicians and celebrities and feature those individuals in our advertising and marketing efforts failure to continue to obtain or maintain highquality sponsorships and endorsers could harm our business in addition actions taken by those individuals associated with our products could harm their reputations which could adversely affect the images of our brands 

vf’s revenues and cash requirements are affected by the seasonal nature of its business 

vf’s business is seasonal with a higher proportion of revenues and operating cash flows generated during the second half of the calendar year which includes the fall and holiday selling seasons poor sales in the second half of the calendar year would have a material adverse effect on vf’s full year operating results and cause higher inventories in addition fluctuations in sales and operating income in any fiscal quarter are affected by the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales 

we may be adversely affected by weather conditions 

our business is adversely affected by unseasonable weather conditions a significant portion of the sales of our products is dependent in part on the weather and is likely to decline in years in which weather conditions do not favor the use of these products for example periods of unseasonably warm weather in the fall or winter can lead to reduced consumer spending that negatively impacts vfs directtoconsumer business and inventory accumulation by our wholesale customers which can in turn negatively affect orders in future seasons in addition abnormally harsh or inclement weather can also negatively impact retail traffic and consumer spending any and all of these risks may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

vf may not succeed in its business strategy 

one of vf’s key strategic objectives is growth we seek to grow organically and through acquisitions we seek to grow by building our lifestyle brands expanding our share with winning 

customers stretching vf’s brands to new regions leveraging our supply chain and information technology capabilities across vf and expanding our directtoconsumer business including opening new stores remodeling and expanding our existing stores and growing our ecommerce business however we may not be able to grow our existing businesses for example 

• we may have difficulty completing acquisitions or dispositions to reshape our portfolio and we may not be able to successfully integrate a newly acquired business or achieve the expected growth cost savings or synergies from such integration or it may disrupt our current business 

• we may not be able to transform our model to be more consumer and retailcentric 

• we may not be able to transform our model to be more digitally focused 

• we may not be able to expand our market share with winning customers or our wholesale customers may encounter financial difficulties and thus reduce their purchases of vf products 

• we may not be able to expand our brands in asia or other geographies 

• we may not be able to achieve the expected results from our supply chain initiatives and establish and maintain effective supply chain capabilities infrastructure and the sourcing strategy necessary to optimally meet current and future business needs 

• we may have difficulty recruiting developing or retaining qualified employees 

• we may not be able to achieve our directtoconsumer expansion goals including in ecommerce or other new channels manage our growth effectively successfully integrate the planned new stores into our operations operate our new remodeled and expanded stores profitably adapt our business model or develop relationships with consumers for ecommerce or other new channels 

• we may not be able to offset rising commodity or conversion costs in our product costs with pricing actions or efficiency improvements 

failure to implement our strategic objectives may have a material adverse effect on vf’s business 

moreover vf is engaged in a business model transformation to become more consumerminded retailcentric and hyperdigital failure to successfully execute vf’s transformation agenda at a fast enough pace with clear objectives assignments accountability project management governance and appropriate consideration for change management could result in a diminished ability to remain competitive 

further organizational effectiveness agility and execution are important to vf’s success failure to create an agile and efficient operating model and organizational structure or to effectively define prioritize and align on clear achievable and appropriately resourced strategic priorities could result in an inability to remain competitive in a rapidly changing marketplace 

12 vf corporation fiscal 2021 form 10k 

table of conte nts 

vf relies significantly on information technology any inadequacy interruption integration failure or security failure of this technology could harm vf’s ability to effectively operate its business 

our ability to effectively manage and operate our business depends significantly on information technology systems we rely heavily on information technology to track sales and inventory and manage our supply chain we are also dependent on information technology including the internet for our directtoconsumer sales including our ecommerce operations and retail business credit card transaction authorization despite our preventative efforts our systems and those of our thirdparty service providers may be vulnerable to damage failure or interruption due to viruses data security incidents technical malfunctions natural disasters or other causes or in connection with upgrades to our system or the implementation of new systems the failure of these systems to operate effectively problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems difficulty in integrating new systems or systems of acquired businesses or a breach in security of these systems could adversely impact the operations of vf’s business including our reputation management of inventory ordering and replenishment of products manufacturing and distribution of products ecommerce operations retail business credit card transaction authorization and processing corporate email communications and our interaction with the public on social media moreover failure to provide effective digital capabilities and information technology infrastructure could result in an inability to meet current and future business needs and a resulting loss of brand competitiveness 

vf is subject to data security and privacy risks that could negatively affect its business operations results of operations or reputation 

in the normal course of business we often collect retain and transmit certain sensitive and confidential customer information including credit card information over public networks there is a significant concern by consumers and employees over the security of personal information transmitted over the internet identity theft and user privacy data security breaches are increasingly sophisticated and are difficult to detect for long periods of time accordingly if unauthorized parties gain access to our networks or databases or those of our thirdparty service providers they may be able to steal publish delete hold ransom or modify our private and sensitive information including credit card information and personal information we have implemented systems and processes designed to protect against unauthorized access to or use of personal information and rely on encryption and authentication technology to effectively secure transmission of confidential customer information including credit card information despite these security measures there is no guarantee that they are adequate and our facilities and systems and those of our thirdparty service providers may be vulnerable and unable to anticipate or detect security breaches and data loss in addition employees may intentionally or inadvertently cause data security breaches that result in the unauthorized release of personal or confidential information vf and its customers could suffer harm if valuable business data or employee customer and other proprietary information were corrupted lost or accessed or misappropriated by third parties due to a security failure in vf’s systems or due to one of our thirdparty service providers or our employees it could require significant expenditures to remediate any such failure or breach severely damage our 

reputation confidence in our ecommerce platforms and our relationships with customers and employees result in business disruption unwanted and negative media attention and lost sales and expose us to risks of litigation liability and increased scrutiny from regulatory entities in addition as a result of recent security breaches at a number of prominent retailers the media and public scrutiny of information security and privacy has become more intense and the regulatory environment has become increasingly uncertain rigorous and complex as a result we may incur significant costs to comply with laws regarding the privacy and security of personal information and we may not be able to comply with new regulations such as the general data protection regulation in the european union the california consumer privacy act and the virginia consumer data protection act any failure to comply with the laws and regulations and consumer expectations surrounding the privacy and security of personal information could subject us to legal and reputational risk including significant fines andor litigation for noncompliance in multiple jurisdictions negative media coverage diminished consumer confidence and decreased attraction to our brands any of which could have a negative impact on revenues and profits in addition our existing insurance policies may not reimburse us for all of the damages that we might incur as a result of a security breach moreover if our associates or vendors intentionally or inadvertently misuse consumer data or are not transparent with consumers about how we use their data our brands reputation and relationships with consumers could be damaged 

there are risks associated with vf’s acquisitions and portfolio management 

any acquisitions or mergers by vf including the recent acquisition of supreme will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of companies these risks include among other things higher than anticipated acquisition costs and expenses the difficulty and expense of integrating the operations systems and personnel of the companies and the loss of key employees and customers as a result of changes in management in addition geographic distances may make integration of acquired businesses more difficult we may not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with any acquisitions moreover failure to effectively manage vf’s portfolio of brands in line with growth targets and shareholder expectations including acquisition choices integration approach and divestiture timing could result in unfavorable impact to growth and value creation 

our acquisitions may cause large onetime expenses or create goodwill or other intangible assets that could result in significant impairment charges in the future we also make certain estimates and assumptions in order to determine purchase price allocation and estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed if our estimates or assumptions used to value these assets and liabilities are not accurate we may be exposed to losses that may be material 

vf uses thirdparty suppliers and manufacturing facilities worldwide for a substantial portion of its raw materials and finished products which poses risks to vf’s business operations 

during fiscal 2021 approximately 96 of vf’s units were purchased from independent manufacture rs primarily located in asia any of the following could impact our ability to produce or 

vf corporation fiscal 2021 form 10k 13 

table of conte nts 

deliver vf products or our cost of producing or delivering products and as a result our profitability 

• political or labor instability in countries where vf’s facilities contractors and suppliers are located 

• changes in local economic conditions in countries where vf’s facilities contractors and suppliers are located 

• public health issues such as the current covid19 pandemic could result in or continue to result in closed factories reduced workforces scarcity of raw materials and scrutiny or embargoing of goods produced in infected areas 

• political or military conflict could cause a delay in the transportation of raw materials and products to vf and an increase in transportation costs 

• disruption at ports of entry could cause delays in product availability and increase transportation times and costs 

• heightened terrorism security concerns could subject imported or exported goods to additional more frequent or lengthier inspections leading to delays in deliveries or impoundment of goods for extended periods 

• decreased scrutiny by customs officials for counterfeit goods leading to more counterfeit goods and reduced sales of vf products increased costs for vf’s anticounterfeiting measures and damage to the reputation of its brands 

• disruptions at manufacturing or distribution facilities caused by natural and manmade disasters 

• imposition of regulations and quotas relating to imports and our ability to adjust timely to changes in trade regulations could limit our ability to produce products in costeffective countries that have the required labor and expertise 

• imposition of duties taxes and other charges on imports and 

• imposition or the repeal of laws that affect intellectual property rights 

although no single supplier and no one country is critical to vf’s production needs if we were to lose a supplier it could result in interruption of finished goods shipments to vf cancellation of orders by customers and termination of relationships this along with the damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on vf’s revenues and consequently our results of operations 

in addition although we audit our thirdparty material suppliers and contracted manufacturing facilities and set strict compliance standards actions by a thirdparty supplier or manufacturer that fail to comply could result in such thirdparty supplier failing to manufacture products that consistently meet our quality standards andor expose vf to claims for damages financial penalties and reputational harm any of which could have a material adverse effect in our business and operations 

a substantial portion of vf’s revenues and gross profit is derived from a small number of large customers the loss of any of these customers or the inability of any of these customers to pay vf could substantially reduce vf’s revenues and profits 

a few of vf’s customers account for a significant portion of revenues sales to vf’s ten largest customers wer e 

approximately 16 of total revenues in fiscal 2021 with our largest customer accounting for approximately 2 of revenues sales to our customers are generally on a purchase or der basis and not subject to longterm agreements a decision by any of vf’s major customers to significantly decrease the volume of products purchased from vf could substantially reduce revenues and have a material adverse effect on vf’s financial condition and results of operations 

talent management employee retention and experience are important factors in vf’s success 

our future success also depends on our ability to attract develop and retain talent with the necessary knowledge skills and experience and maintain a culture of wellbeing empowerment and diversity to ensure vf is innovative and remains competitive in a rapidlychanging global marketplace competition for experienced and wellqualified personnel is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel which could impact vf’s ability to remain competitive if we are unable to retain attract and motivate talented employees with the appropriate skill sets or if changes to our organizational structure operating results or business model adversely affect morale or retention we may not achieve our objectives and our results of operations could be adversely impacted vf depends on the services and management experience of its executive officers and business leaders who have substantial experience and expertise in vf’s business the unexpected loss of services of one or more of these individuals or the inability to effectively identify a suitable successor to a key role could have a material adverse effect on vf 

vf’s directtoconsumer business includes risks that could have an adverse effect on its results of operations 

vf sells merchandise directtoconsumer through vfoperated stores and ecommerce sites its directtoconsumer business is subject to numerous risks that could have a material adverse effect on its results risks include but are not limited to i us or international resellers purchasing merchandise and reselling it overseas outside vf’s control ii failure of the systems that operate the stores and websites and their related support systems including computer viruses theft of customer information privacy concerns telecommunication failures and electronic breakins and similar disruptions iii credit card fraud and iv risks related to vf’s directtoconsumer distribution centers and processes risks specific to vf’s ecommerce business also include i diversion of sales from vf stores or wholesale customers ii difficulty in recreating the instore experience through direct channels iii liability for online content iv changing patterns of consumer behavior and v intense competition from online retailers vf’s failure to successfully respond to these risks might adversely affect sales in its ecommerce business as well as damage its reputation and brands 

our vfoperated stores and ecommerce business require substantial fixed investments in equipment and leasehold improvements information systems inventory and personnel we have entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space due to the high fixedcost structure associated with our directtoconsumer operations a decline in sales or the closure of or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs writeoffs of equipment and leasehold improvements and employeerelated costs

vf’s net sales depend on the volume of traffic to its stores and the availability of suitable lease space 

a growing portion of our revenues are directtoconsumer sales through vfoperated stores in order to generate customer traffic we locate many of our stores in prominent locations within successful retail shopping centers or in fashionable shopping districts our stores benefit from the ability of the retail center and other attractions in an area to generate consumer traffic in the vicinity of our stores part of our future growth is significantly dependent on our ability to operate stores in desirable locations with capital investment and lease costs providing the opportunity to earn a reasonable return we cannot control the development of new shopping centers or districts the availability or cost of appropriate locations within existing or new shopping centers or districts competition with other retailers for prominent locations or the success of individual shopping centers or districts further if we are unable to renew or replace our existing store leases or enter into leases for new stores on favorable terms or if we violate the terms of our current leases our growth and profitability could be harmed all of these factors may impact our ability to meet our growth targets and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

vf may be unable to protect its trademarks and other intellectual property rights 

vf’s trademarks and other intellectual property rights are important to its success and its competitive position vf is susceptible to others copying its products and infringing its intellectual property rights especially with the shift in product mix to higher priced brands and innovative new products in recent years some of vf’s brands such as the north face ®  timberland ®  vans ®  jansport ®  dickies ® and supreme ® enjoy significant worldwide consumer recognition and the higher pricing of those products creates additional risk of counterfeiting and infringement 

vf’s trademarks trade names patents trade secrets and other intellectual property are important to vf’s success counterfeiting of vf’s products or infringement on its intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our brands and adversely affect vf’s revenues actions we have taken to establish and protect vf’s intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent copying of its products by others or to prevent others from seeking to invalidate its trademarks or block sales of vf’s products as a violation of the trademarks and intellectual property rights of others in addition unilateral actions in the us or other countries including changes to or the repeal of laws recognizing trademark or other intellectual property rights could have an impact on vf’s ability to enforce those rights 

the value of vf’s intellectual property could diminish if others assert rights in or ownership of trademarks and other intellectual property rights of vf or trademarks that are similar to vf’s trademarks or trademarks that vf licenses from others we may be unable to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction in some cases there may be trademark owners who have prior rights to vf’s trademarks because the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the us in other cases there may be holders who have prior rights to similar trademarks 

there have been and there may in the future be opposition and cancellation proceedings from time to time with respect to some of vfs intellectual property rights in some cases litigation may be necessary to protect or enforce our trademarks and other intellectual property rights furthermore third parties may assert intellectual property claims against us and we may be subject to liability required to enter into costly license agreements if available at all required to rebrand our products andor prevented from selling some of our products if third parties successfully oppose or challenge our trademarks or successfully claim that we infringe misappropriate or otherwise violate their trademarks copyrights patents or other intellectual property rights bringing or defending any such claim regardless of merit and whether successful or unsuccessful could be expensive and timeconsuming and have a negative effect on vfs business reputation results of operations and financial condition 

if vf encounters problems with its distribution system vf’s ability to deliver its products to the market could be adversely affected 

vf relies on owned or independentlyoperated distribution facilities to warehouse and ship product to its customers vf’s distribution system includes computercontrolled and automated equipment which may be subject to a number of risks related to security or computer viruses the proper operation of software and hardware power interruptions or other system failures because substantially all of vf’s products are distributed from a relatively small number of locations vf’s operations could also be interrupted by earthquakes floods fires or other natural disasters or other events outside vfs control affecting its distribution centers we maintain business interruption insurance under our property and cyber insurance policies but it may not adequately protect vf from the adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in vf’s distribution facilities in addition vf’s distribution capacity is dependent on the timely performance of services by third parties including the transportation of product to and from its distribution facilities if we encounter problems with our distribution system our ability to meet customer expectations manage inventory complete sales and achieve operating efficiencies could be materially adversely affected 

vf’s business and operations could be materially and adversely affected if it fails to create systems of monitoring prevention response crisis management continuity and recovery to mitigate natural or manmade economic political or environmental disruptions 

business resiliency is important to vf’s success because there are a variety of risks generally associated with doing business on a global basis that may involve natural or manmade economic political or environmental disruptions disruptions and government responses to any disruption could cause among other things a decrease in consumer spending that would negatively impact our sales delays in the fulfillment or cancellation of customer orders or disruptions in the manufacture and shipment of products increased costs and a negative impact on our reputation and longterm growth plans the impact of disruptions may vary based on the length and severity of the disruption vf’s failure to create systems of monitoring prevention response crisis management continuity and recovery to mitigate potential threats impacting its business people processes and facilities could result in extended disruptions and unpredictability

vf’s operations and earnings may be affected by legal regulatory political and economic uncertainty and risks 

our ability to maintain the current level of operations in our existing markets and to capitalize on growth in existing and new markets is subject to legal regulatory political and economic uncertainty and risks these include the burdens of complying with us and international laws and regulations and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements 

changes in regulatory geopolitical policies and other factors may adversely affect vf’s business or may require us to modify our current business practices while enactment of any such change is not certain if such changes were adopted or if we failed to anticipate and mitigate the impact of such changes our costs could increase which would reduce our earnings for example on january 31 2020 the united kingdom ceased to be a member state of the european union commonly referred to as “brexit” the united kingdom and the european union subsequently reached a provisional postbrexit trade and cooperation agreement that contains new rules governing the relationship between the united kingdom and europe including with respect to trade travel and immigration brexit could adversely affect european and worldwide economic and market conditions and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets any of these effects of brexit and others we cannot anticipate could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

changes to us or international trade policy tariff and importexport regulations or our failure to comply with such regulations may have a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition and results of operations 

changes in us or international social political regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade manufacturing development and investment in the territories or countries where we currently sell our products or conduct our business as well as any negative sentiment toward the us as a result of such changes could adversely affect our business the us government has instituted or proposed changes in trade policies that include the negotiation or termination of trade agreements the imposition of higher tariffs on imports into the us economic sanctions on individuals corporations or countries and other government regulations affecting trade between the us and other countries where we conduct our business it may be timeconsuming and expensive for us to alter our business operations in order to adapt to or comply with any such changes 

as a result of recent policy changes of the us government and recent us government proposals there may be greater restrictions and economic disincentives on international trade tariffs and other changes in us trade policy have in the past and could continue to trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries and certain foreign governments have instituted considered or are considering imposing retaliatory measures on certain us goods vf similar to many other multinational corporations does a significant amount of business that would be impacted by changes to the trade policies of the us and foreign countries including governmental action related to tariffs international trade agreements or economic sanctions such changes have the potential to adversely impact the us economy or certain sectors thereof our industry and the global 

demand for our products and as a result could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

changes in tax laws could increase our worldwide tax rate and tax liabilities and materially affect our financial position and results of operations 

we are subject to taxation in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act “us tax act” which included a broad range of tax reform proposals affecting businesses including a reduction in the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 a onetime mandatory deemed repatriation tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously taxdeferred and a new minimum tax on certain foreign earnings taxes related to the onetime mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings due over a period of time could be accelerated upon certain triggering events including failure to pay such taxes when due in addition regulatory administrative and legislative guidance related to the us tax act continues to be released to the extent any future guidance differs from our interpretation of the law or the new us presidential administration takes further action including through its recent proposal of a higher us federal corporate tax rate and increased taxation of offshore income such guidance or action could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 

the swiss government enacted the federal act on tax reform and ahv financing “swiss tax act” which became effective on january 1 2020 the swiss tax act was enacted to ensure that switzerland stays in conformity with the european union “eu” as well as organisation for economic cooperation and development “oecd” standards on international taxation the impact of the swiss tax act has been reported based on the official initial guidelines provided by the swiss federal and cantonal authorities future guidance that differs from our preliminary interpretation or any negative reaction from the eu member states to the swiss tax act could have material effect on our financial position and results of operations the eu has also developed a list of noncooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes referred to as the “blacklist” we continuously monitor the blacklist to determine any potential impact to vf 

in addition many countries in the eu and around the globe have adopted andor proposed changes to current tax laws further organizations such as the oecd have published action plans that if adopted by countries where we do business could increase our tax obligations in these countries more specifically the oecd has proposed an approach to address tax challenges arising from the digitalization of the economy the ultimate outcome of these proposals and the agreed upon solution that is enacted into law in each country may result in a material financial impact to vf 

due to the large scale of our us and international business activities many of these enacted and proposed changes to the taxation of our activities could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations

we may have additional tax liabilities from new or evolving government or judicial interpretation of existing tax laws 

as a global company we determine our income tax liability in various tax jurisdictions based on an analysis and interpretation of us and local tax laws and regulations this analysis requires a significant amount of judgment and estimation and is often based on various assumptions about the future actions of the tax authorities these determinations are the subject of periodic us and international tax audits and court proceedings in particular tax authorities and the courts have increased their focus on income earned in no or lowtax jurisdictions or income that is not taxed in any jurisdiction tax authorities have also become skeptical of special tax rulings provided to companies offering lower taxes than may be applicable in other countries 

for example vf was granted a ruling which lowered the effective income tax rate on taxable earnings for years 2010 through 2014 under belgium’s excess profit tax regime in february 2015 the eu opened a state aid investigation into belgium’s rulings on january 11 2016 the eu announced its decision that these rulings were illegal and ordered that tax benefits granted under these rulings should be collected from the affected companies including vf 

on march 22 2016 the belgium government filed an appeal seeking annulment of the eu decision additionally on june 21 2016 vf europe bvba filed its own application for annulment of the eu decision 

on february 14 2019 the general court annulled the eu decision and on april 26 2019 the eu appealed the general courts annulment both listed requests for annulment remain open and unresolved additionally the eu has initiated proceedings related to individual rulings granted by belgium including the ruling granted to vf vf notes that the exposure for this tax matter is estimated at approximately 37 million which has already been paid by vf 

also vf petitioned the us tax court to resolve an internal revenue service irs dispute regarding the timing of income inclusion associated with the 2011 timberland acquisition vf remains confident in our timing and treatment of the income inclusion and therefore this matter is not reflected in our financial statements we are vigorously defending our position and do not expect the resolution to have a material adverse impact on vfs financial position results of operations or cash flows while the irs argues immediate income inclusion vfs position is to include the income over a period of years as the matter relates to 2011 nearly half of the timing in dispute has passed vf including the income and paying the related tax on our income tax returns  vf notes that should the irs prevail in this timing matter the net interest expense would be up to 1810 million further this timing matter is impacted by the us tax act that reduced the us corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 if the irs is successful this rate differential would increase tax expense by approximately 1363 million 

although we accrue for uncertain tax positions our accrual may be insufficient to satisfy unfavorable findings unfavorable audit findings or court interpretations involving vf or other companies with similar tax profiles may result in payment of taxes fines and penalties for prior periods and higher tax rates in future periods which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

our business is subject to national state and local laws and regulations for environmental consumer protection corporate governance competition employment privacy safety and other matters the costs of compliance with or the violation of such laws and regulations by vf or by independent suppliers who manufacture products for vf could have an adverse effect on our operations and cash flows as well as on our reputation 

our business is subject to comprehensive national state and local laws and regulations on a wide range of environmental consumer protection employment privacy safety and other matters vf could be adversely affected by costs of compliance with or violations of those laws and regulations in addition while we do not control their business practices we require thirdparty suppliers to operate in compliance with applicable laws rules and regulations regarding working conditions safety employment practices and environmental compliance the costs of products purchased by vf from independent contractors could increase due to the costs of compliance by those contractors 

failure by vf or its thirdparty suppliers to comply with such laws and regulations as well as with ethical social product safety labor and environmental standards or related political considerations could result in interruption of finished goods shipments to vf extensive remediation efforts cancellation of orders by customers and termination of relationships if vf or one of our independent contractors violates labor or other laws implements labor or other business practices or takes other actions that are generally regarded as unethical it could result in unwanted or negative media attention jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions including boycotts that may reduce demand for vf’s merchandise damage to vf’s reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on vf’s results of operations financial condition and cash flows as well as require additional resources to rebuild vf’s reputation 

our international operations are also subject to compliance with the us foreign corrupt practices act the “fcpa” and other antibribery laws applicable to our operations although we have policies and procedures to address compliance with the fcpa and similar laws there can be no assurance that all of our employees agents and other partners will not take actions in violation of our policies any such violation could subject us to sanctions or other penalties that could negatively affect our reputation business and operating results 

climate change and increased focus by governmental and nongovernmental organizations customers consumers and investors on sustainability issues including those related to climate change and socially responsible activities may adversely affect our business and financial results and damage our reputation 

climate change is occurring around the world and may impact our business in numerous ways such change could lead to an increase in raw material and packaging prices reduced availability for example due to water shortages which could adversely impact raw material availability increased frequency of extreme weather storms and floods could cause increased incidence of disruption to the production and distribution of our products and an adverse impact on consumer demand and spending 

investor advocacy groups certain institutional investors investment funds other market participants shareholders and stakeholders have focused increasingly on the environmental

social and governance esg and related sustainability practices of companies these parties have placed increased importance on the implications of the social cost of their investments if our esg practices do not meet investor or other stakeholder expectations and standards which continue to evolve our brands reputation and employee retention may be negatively impacted it is possible that stakeholders may not be satisfied with our esg practices or the speed of their adoption we could also incur additional costs and require additional 

resources to monitor report and comply with various esg practices also our failure or perceived failure to manage reputational threats and meet expectations with respect to socially responsible activities and sustainability commitments could negatively impact our credibility employee retention and the willingness of our customers and suppliers to do business with us 



vf’s balance sheet includes a significant amount of intangible assets and goodwill a decline in the fair value of an intangible asset or of a business unit could result in an asset impairment charge which would be recorded as an operating expense in vf’s consolidated statement of operations and could be material 

vf’s policy is to evaluate indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill for possible impairment as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of such assets may be below their carrying amount in addition intangible assets that are being amortized are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable for these impairment tests we use various valuation methods to estimate the fair value of our business units and intangible assets if the fair value of an asset is less than its carrying value we would recognize an impairment charge for the difference 

it is possible that we could have an impairment charge for goodwill or trademark and trade name intangible assets in future periods if i overall economic conditions in fiscal 2022 or future years vary from our current assumptions ii business conditions or our strategies for a specific business unit change from our current assumptions iii investors require higher rates of return on equity investments in the marketplace or iv enterprise values of comparable publicly traded companies or of actual sales transactions of comparable companies were to decline resulting in lower comparable multiples of revenues and earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and accordingly lower implied values of goodwill and intangible assets a future impairment charge for goodwill or intangible assets could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

fluctuations in wage rates and the price availability and quality of raw materials and finished goods could increase costs 

fluctuations in the price availability and quality of fabrics leather or other raw materials used by vf in its manufactured products or of purchased finished goods could have a material adverse effect on vf’s cost of goods sold or its ability to meet its customers’ demands the prices we pay depend on demand and market prices for the raw materials used to produce them the price and availability of such raw materials may fluctuate significantly depending on many factors including general economic conditions and demand crop yields energy prices weather patterns public health issues such as the covid19 pandemic and speculation in the commodities markets prices of purchased finished products also depend on wage rates in asia and other geographic areas where our independent contractors are located as well as freight costs from those regions inflation can also have a longterm impact on us 

because increasing costs of materials and labor may impact our ability to maintain satisfactory margins for example the cost of the materials that are used in our manufacturing process such as oilrelated commodity prices and other raw materials such as cotton dyes and chemical and other costs such as fuel energy and utility costs can fluctuate as a result of inflation and other factors similarly a significant portion of our products are manufactured in other countries and declines in the values of the us dollar may result in higher manufacturing costs in addition fluctuations in wage rates required by legal or industry standards could increase our costs in the future vf may not be able to offset cost increases with other cost reductions or efficiencies or to pass higher costs on to its customers this could have a material adverse effect on vf’s results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

vf’s business is exposed to the risks of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations vf’s hedging strategies may not be effective in mitigating those risks 

a growing percentage of vf’s total revenues approximately 50 in fiscal 2021 is derived from markets outside the us vf’s international businesses operate in functional currencies other than the us dollar changes in currency exchange rates affect the us dollar value of the foreign currencydenominated amounts at which vf’s international businesses purchase products incur costs or sell products in addition for vf’s usbased businesses the majority of products are sourced from independent contractors or vf plants located in foreign countries as a result the costs of these products are affected by changes in the value of the relevant currencies furthermore much of vf’s licensing revenue is derived from sales in foreign currencies changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse impact on vf’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in accordance with our operating practices we hedge a significant portion of our foreign currency transaction exposures arising in the ordinary course of business to reduce risks in our cash flows and earnings our hedging strategy may not be effective in reducing all risks and no hedging strategy can completely insulate vf from foreign exchange risk 

further our use of derivative financial instruments may expose vf to counterparty risks although vf only enters into hedging contracts with counterparties having investment grade credit ratings it is possible that the credit quality of a counterparty could be downgraded or a counterparty could default on its obligations which could have a material adverse impact on vf’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows

our ability to obtain shortterm or longterm financing on favorable terms if needed could be adversely affected by geopolitical risk and volatility in the capital markets 

any disruption in the capital markets could limit the availability of funds or the ability or willingness of financial institutions to extend capital in the future future volatility in the financial and credit markets including the recent volatility due in part to the current covid19 pandemic could make it more difficult for us to obtain financing or refinance existing debt when the need arises including upon maturity or on terms that would be acceptable to us this disruption or volatility could adversely affect our liquidity and funding resources or significantly increase our cost of capital an inability to access capital and credit markets may have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

in addition the uk financial conduct authority announced in 2017 that it intends to phase out libor by the end of 2021 in november 2020 ice benchmark administration the administrator of libor with support from the us federal reserve announced a consultation period on its intention to continue us libor quotes for the most actively used maturities on legacy transactions until june 2023 with the remainder to phase out by the end of 2021 as previously announced following this announcement multiple us governmental agencies issued a joint statement encouraging banks to transition away from libor for new contracts as soon as practicable and no later than december 31 2021 uncertainty regarding rates may make borrowing or refinancing our indebtedness more expensive or difficult to achieve on terms we consider favorable 

vf’s indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on its business financial condition and results of operations and prevent vf from fulfilling its financial obligations and vf may not be able to maintain its current credit ratings may not continue to pay dividends or repurchase its common stock and may not remain in compliance with existing debt covenants 

as of april 3 2021 vf had approximately 57 billion of debt outstanding vf’s debt and interest payment requirements could have important consequences on its business financial condition and results of operations for example it could 

• require vf to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to repaying its indebtedness which would reduce the availability of its cash flow to fund working capital requirements capital expenditures future acquisitions dividends repurchase vf’s common stock and for other general corporate purposes 

• limit vf’s flexibility in planning for or reacting to general adverse economic conditions or changes in its business and the industries in which it operates 

• place vf at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that have less indebtedness outstanding and 

• negatively affect vfs credit ratings and limit along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in vf’s debt documents its ability to borrow additional funds 

in addition vf may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future to fund acquisitions repurchase common stock or fund other activities for general business purposes if vf incurs additional indebtedness it may limit vf’s ability to access the debt capital markets or other forms of financing in the future and may result in increased borrowing costs 

although vf has historically declared and paid quarterly cash dividends on its common stock and has been authorized to repurchase its stock subject to certain limitations under its share repurchase programs any determinations by the board of directors to continue to declare and pay cash dividends on vf’s common stock or to repurchase vf’s common stock will be based primarily upon vf’s financial condition results of operations and business requirements its access to debt capital markets or other forms of financing the price of its common stock in the case of the repurchase program and the board of directors’ continuing determination that the repurchase programs and the declaration and payment of dividends are in the best interests of vf’s shareholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the repurchase and dividend programs for example during fiscal 2021 vf decided to temporarily pause its share repurchase program to support its business in response to the covid19 pandemic in the event vf does not declare and pay a quarterly dividend or once again discontinues its share repurchases vf’s stock price could be adversely affected 

vf is required to comply with certain financial and other restrictive debt covenants in its debt documents failure by vf to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default that if not cured or waived could have a material adverse effect on vf if the lenders declare any outstanding obligations to be immediately due and payable 

vf is subject to the risk that its licensees may not generate expected sales or maintain the value of vf’s brands 

during fiscal 2021 517 million of vf’s rev enues were derived from licensing royalties although vf generally has significant control over its licensees’ products and advertising we rely on our licensees for among other things operational and financial controls over their businesses failure of our licensees to successfully market licensed products or our inability to replace existing licensees if necessary could adversely affect vf’s revenues both directly from reduced royalties received and indirectly from reduced sales of our other products risks are also associated with a licensee’s ability to 

• obtain capital 

• manage its labor relations 

• maintain relationships with its suppliers 

• manage its credit risk effectively 

• maintain relationships with its customers and 

• adhere to vf’s global compliance principles 

in addition vf relies on its licensees to help preserve the value of its brands although we attempt to protect vf’s brands through approval rights over design production processes quality packaging merchandising distribution advertising and promotion of our licensed products we cannot completely control the use of licensed vf brands by our licensees the misuse of a brand by a licensee including through the marketing of products under one of our brand names that do not meet our quality standards could have a material adverse effect on that brand and on vf

volatility in securities markets interest rates and other economic factors could substantially increase vf’s defined benefit pension costs 

vf currently has obligations under its defined benefit pension plans the funded status of the pension plans is dependent on many factors including returns on investment assets and the discount rate used to determine pension obligations unfavorable impacts from returns on plan assets decreases in discount rates changes in plan demographics or revisions in the applicable laws or regulations could materially change the timing and amount of pension funding requirements which could reduce cash available for vf’s business 

vf’s operating performance also may be negatively impacted by the amount of expense recorded for its pension plans pension expense is calculated using actuarial valuations that incorporate assumptions and estimates about financial market economic and demographic conditions differences between estimated and actual results give rise to gains and losses that are deferred and amortized as part of future pension expense which can create volatility that adversely impacts vf’s future operating results 

we may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits we expect to achieve from the spinoff 

on may 22 2019 we completed the spinoff of our jeans business kontoor brands inc kontoor brands although we believe that the spinoff will enhance our longterm value we may not be able to achieve some or all of the anticipated benefits from the separation of our businesses and the spinoff may adversely affect our business separating the businesses resulted in two independent publicly traded companies each of which is now a smaller less diversified and more narrowly focused business than before the spinoff which makes us more vulnerable to changing market and economic conditions additionally a potential loss of synergies from separating the businesses could negatively impact the balance sheet profit margins or earnings of both businesses and the combined value of the common stock of the two publicly traded companies may not be equal to or greater than the value of vf common stock had the spinoff not occurred if we fail to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve as a result of the spinoff or do not achieve them in the time we expect our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

the kontoor brands spinoff could result in substantial tax liability to us and our shareholders 

we received opinions of tax advisors substantially to the effect that for us federal income tax purposes the spinoff and certain related transactions qualify for taxfree treatment under 

certain sections of the internal revenue code however if the factual assumptions or representations made by us in connection with the delivery of the opinions are inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect including those relating to the past and future conduct of our business we will not be able to rely on the opinions furthermore the opinions are not binding on the irs or the courts if notwithstanding receipt of the opinions the spinoff transaction and certain related transactions are determined to be taxable we would be subject to a substantial tax liability in addition if the spinoff transaction is taxable each holder of our common stock who received shares of kontoor brands in connection with the spinoff would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares received 

even if the spinoff otherwise qualifies as a taxfree transaction the distribution would be taxable to us but not to our shareholders in certain circumstances if future significant acquisitions of our stock or the stock of kontoor brands are deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that included the spinoff in this event the resulting tax liability could be substantial in connection with the spinoff we entered into a tax matters agreement with kontoor brands pursuant to which kontoor brands agreed to not enter into any transaction that could cause any portion of the spinoff to be taxable to us without our consent and to indemnify us for any tax liability resulting from any such transaction in addition these potential tax liabilities may discourage delay or prevent a change of control of us 

a director who serves on our board of directors also serves as a director of kontoor brands and ownership of shares of common stock of kontoor brands by our directors and executive officers may create or appear to create conflicts of interest 

a director who serves on our board of directors currently serves on the board of directors of kontoor brands this may create or appear to create conflicts of interest when our or kontoor brands management and directors face decisions that could have different implications for us and kontoor brands including the resolution of any dispute regarding the terms of the agreements governing the spinoff and our relationship with kontoor brands or any other commercial agreements entered into in the future between us and kontoor brands 

some of our executive officers and nonemployee directors currently own shares of the common stock of kontoor brands the continued ownership of such common stock by our directors and executive officers may create or may appear to create a conflict of interest when these directors and executive officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for us and kontoor brands

government entities and public health authorities to prioritize the health and wellbeing of its employees customers trade partners and consumers as covid19 uncertainty continues retail store reclosures may occur 

consistent with vf’s longterm strategy the company’s digital platform remains a high priority through which its brands stay connected with consumer communities while providing experiential content prior to the covid19 pandemic consumer spending had started shifting to brand ecommerce sites and other digital platforms which has accelerated due to changes in the retail landscape resulting from the covid19 pandemic 

covid19 has also impacted some of vfs suppliers including thirdparty manufacturers logistics providers and other vendors at this time the majority of vfs supply chain is operational suppliers are complying with local health advisories and governmental restrictions which has resulted in isolated product delays however vf is actively working with its suppliers to minimize disruption vfs distribution centers are operational in accordance with local government guidelines while maintaining enhanced health and safety protocols 

in response to covid19 various government programs have been announced to provide financial relief to affected businesses including the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act cares act the cares act among other things provides employer payroll tax credits for wages paid to employees unable to work during the covid19 pandemic and options to defer payroll tax payments other foreign government programs available to vf also provide certain payroll tax credits and wage subsidies the company recognized 814 million during the year ended march 2021 as a result of relief from the cares act and other governmental packages which were recorded as a reduction in selling general and administrative expenses the company also intends to defer qualified payroll and other tax payments as permitted by the cares act and other governmental packages

the covid19 pandemic is ongoing and dynamic in nature and has driven global uncertainty and disruption as a result covid19 had a significant negative impact on the companys business including the consolidated financial condition results 

of operations and cash flows during the year ended march 2021 while we are not able to determine the ultimate length and severity of the covid19 pandemic we expect ongoing disruption to our business 



vf has taken a number of actions to advance its enterprise protection strategy in response to the covid19 pandemic 

on april 23 2020 vf closed its sale of senior unsecured notes which provided net proceeds to the company of approximately 297 billion a portion of the net proceeds was used to repay borrowings under the companys senior unsecured revolving credit facility the global credit facility and the remaining net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes at march 2021 vf had approximately 14 billion of cash and equivalents and shortterm investments additionally vf had approximately 22 billion available for borrowing against the global credit facility subject to certain restrictions including a 7500 million minimum liquidity requirement  

other actions vf has taken to support its business in response to the covid19 pandemic include the companys decision to temporarily pause its share repurchase program the company currently has 28 billion remaining under its current share repurchase authorization the company paid a cash dividend of 194 per share during the year ended march 2021 and has declared a cash dividend of 049 per share that is payable in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 subject to approval by its board of directors vf intends to continue to pay its regularly scheduled dividend and is not contemplating the suspension of its dividend at this time vfs divestiture of the occupational workwear business is expected to provide an additional source of cash in fiscal 2022 

vf has implemented cost controls to reduce discretionary spending to help mitigate the loss of sales and to conserve cash while continuing to support employees the company has also commenced a multiyear initiative designed to enable our ability to accelerate and advance vfs business model transformation one of the key objectives of this initiative is to deliver global cost savings of approximately 1250 million over a threeyear period that will be used to support the transformation agenda and highestpriority growth drivers as vf continues to actively monitor the situation and advance our business model transformation we may take further actions that affect our operations 

we believe the company has sufficient liquidity and flexibility to operate and continue to execute our strategy during the disruptions caused by the covid19 pandemic and related governmental actions and regulations and health authority advisories and meet its obligations as they become due however due to the uncertainty of the duration and severity of the covid19 pandemic governmental actions in response to the pandemic and the impact on us and our consumers customers and suppliers there is no certainty that the measures we take will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by covid19 see item 1a risk factors for additional discussion

the following discussion refers to significant changes in balances for continuing operations at march 2021 compared to march 2020 

• decrease in inventories — primarily due to lower inventory purchases as part of our inventory management to ensure proper matching of supply and demand resulting from reduced consumer demand due to the impact of covid19 

• increase in shortterm investments — due to new investments of excess cash entered into during fiscal 2021 

• increase in intangible assets — primarily due to the acquired indefinitelived supreme ® trademark intangible asset of 12 billion recorded in connection with the acquisition 

• increase in goodwill — primarily due to the amounts recorded in connection with the supreme acquisition of 125 billion 

• increase in operating lease rightofuse assets — primarily due to the commencement of new distribution center leases in europe and north america during fiscal 2021 

• increase in other assets — primarily due to amounts recorded in connection with the supreme acquisition increases in assets held for deferred compensation plans and an increase in net pension assets for certain defined benefit plans 

• decrease in shortterm borrowings — due to the net repayment of borrowings under the global credit facility using a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of senior unsecured fixedrate notes in april 2020 

• increase in accrued liabilities — primarily due to amounts recorded in connection with the supreme acquisition and an increase in current operating lease liabilities derivative liabilities accrued interest and compensationrelated liabilities 

• increase in longterm debt — due to the issuance of 30 billion of senior unsecured fixedrate notes in april 2020 

• increase in operating lease liabilities — primarily due to the commencement of new distribution center leases in europe and north america during fiscal 2021 

• increase in other liabilities — primarily due to deferred taxes and the contingent consideration liability of 2070 million recorded in connection with the supreme acquisition 



we consider the following to be measures of our liquidity and capital resources 



the increase in the current ratio at march 2021 compared to march 2020 was primarily due to a net decrease in current liabilities driven by lower shortterm borrowings as discussed in the balance sheets section above 

for the ratio of net debt to total capital net debt is defined as shortterm and longterm borrowings in addition to operating lease liabilities net of unrestricted cash total capital is defined as net debt plus stockholders’ equity the increase in the net debt to total capital ratio at march 2021 compared to march 2020 was attributed to the increase in longterm debt partially offset by the decrease in shortterm borrowings as discussed in the balance sheets section above the increase was also attributed to a decrease in stockholders equity driven by payments of dividends partially offset by current period income 

vf’s primary source of liquidity is its expected strong annual cash flow from operating activities cash from operations is typically lower in the first half of the calendar year as inventory builds to support peak sales periods in the second half of the calendar year cash provided by operating activities in the second half of the calendar year is substantially higher as inventories are sold and accounts receivable are collected additionally directtoconsumer sales are typically highest in the fourth quarter of the calendar year vfs additional sources of liquidity include available borrowing capacity against its global credit facility available cash and investment balances and international lines of credit

table of conte nts 

in summary our cash flows from continuing operations were as follows 



cash provided by operating activities 

cash flow related to operating activities is dependent on net income adjustments to net income and changes in working capital the increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 is primarily due to a decrease in net cash usage for working capital partially offset by lower earnings for the periods compared 

cash used by investing activities 

the increase in cash used by investing activities in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 related primarily to the cash paid to acquire supreme of 20 billion net of cash received and purchases of shortterm investments of 8000 million partially offset by proceeds from maturities of shortterm investments of 2000 million capital expenditures decreased 895 million and software purchases increased 299 million in fiscal 2021 compared to the fiscal 2020 period 

cash provided by financing activities 

the increase in cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily due to the increase in net proceeds from longterm debt issuances of 19 billion a 10 billion decrease in share repurchases and a 6474 million decrease in payments on longterm debt which was partially offset by a 18 billion net decrease in shortterm borrowings for the periods compared the increase was also partially offset by 9061 million of cash received from kontoor brands net of cash transferred in fiscal 2020 

share repurchases 

vf did not purchase shares of its common stock in the open market during fiscal 2021 during fiscal 2020 vf purchased 120 million shares of its common stock in open market transactions at a total cost of 10 billion average price per share of 8333 under the share repurchase program authorized by vfs board of directors 

in response to the covid19 outbreak and to preserve financial liquidity vf has made the decision to temporarily pause its share repurchase program as of the end of fiscal 2021 the company had 28 billion remaining for future repurchases under its share repurchase program vf will continue to evaluate its use of capital giving first priority to enterprise protection and then to business acquisitions and direct shareholder return in the form of dividends and share repurchases 

revolving credit facility and shortterm borrowings 

vf relies on its ability to generate cash flows to finance its ongoing operations in addition vf has significant liquidity from its available cash and investment balances and credit facilities vf maintains a 225 billion senior unsecured revolving line of 

credit the “global credit facility” that expires december 2023 vf may request an unlimited number of one year extensions so long as each extension does not cause the remaining life of the global credit facility to exceed five years subject to stated terms and conditions the global credit facility may be used to borrow funds in both us dollar and certain nonus dollar currencies and has a 500 million letter of credit sublimit in addition the global credit facility supports vf’s us commercial paper program for shortterm seasonal working capital requirements and general corporate purposes including share repurchases and acquisitions outstanding shortterm balances may vary from period to period depending on the level of corporate requirements borrowings under the global credit facility are priced at a credit spread of 910 basis points over the appropriate libor benchmark for each currency vf is also required to pay a facility fee to the lenders currently equal to 90 basis points of the committed amount of the facility the credit spread and facility fee are subject to adjustment based on vf’s credit ratings 

in april 2020 vf entered into an amendment to the global credit facility that resulted in certain changes to the restrictive covenants including an increase to the consolidated indebtedness to consolidated capitalization ratio financial covenant to 70 from 60 and a revision to the calculation of consolidated indebtedness to be net of unrestricted cash as of march 2021 the covenant calculation includes cash and equivalents and shortterm investments and excludes consolidated operating lease liabilities in addition the amendment requires vf and its subsidiaries to maintain minimum liquidity in the form of unrestricted cash and unused financing commitments of not less than 7500 million as of march 2021 vf was in compliance with all covenants 

vf has a commercial paper program that allows for borrowings up to 225 billion to the extent that it has borrowing capacity under the global credit facility there were no commercial paper borrowings as of march 2021 standby letters of credit issued as of march 2021 were 241 million leaving approximately 22 billion available for borrowing against the global credit facility at march 2021 additionally vf had approximately 14 billion of cash and equivalents and shortterm investments at march 2021 

vf has 639 million of international lines of credit with various banks which are uncommitted and may be terminated at any time by either vf or the banks total outstanding balances under these arrangements were 111 million and 138 million at march 2021 and march 2020 respectively borrowings under these arrangements had a weighted average interest rate of 110 and 163 at march 2021 and march 2020 respectively 

senior notes issuance 

on april 23 2020 vf closed its sale of senior unsecured notes including 10 billion of 2050 notes due april 2022 7500 million of 2400 notes due april 2025 5000 million of 2800 

34 vf corporation fiscal 2021 form 10k 

table of conte nts 

notes due april 2027 and 7500 million of 2950 notes due april 2030 the net proceeds received by the company were approximately 297 billion a portion of the net proceeds was used to repay outstanding borrowings under the global credit facility resulting from actions taken by vf to strengthen the companys cash position in response to the covid19 pandemic 

rating agencies 

vf’s favorable credit agency ratings allow for access to additional liquidity at competitive rates at the end of march 2021 vf’s longterm debt ratings were ‘a’ by standard  poor’s sp global ratings and ‘baa1’ by moody’s investors service both with stable outlooks and commercial paper ratings by those rating agencies were ‘a2’ and ‘p2’ respectively 

none of vf’s longterm debt agreements contain acceleration of maturity clauses based solely on changes in credit ratings however if there were a change in control of vf and as a result 

of the change in control the notes were rated below investment grade by recognized rating agencies then vf would be obligated to repurchase the notes at 101 of the aggregate principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest if required by the respective holders of the notes the change of control provision applies to all notes except for the 2033 note 

dividends 

cash dividends totaled 194 per share in fiscal 2021 compared to 190 in fiscal 2020 the dividend payout ratio was 1865 of diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2021 compared to 1118 in fiscal 2020 the company has declared a dividend of 049 per share that is payable in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 subject to approval by its board of directors vf intends to continue to pay its regularly scheduled dividend and is not contemplating the suspension of its dividend at this time 

contractual obligations 

following is a summary of vf’s material contractual obligations and commercial commitments at the end of march 2021 that will require the use of funds 





1 longterm debt consists of required principal payments on longterm debt and finance lease obligations 

2 operating leases represent required lease payments during the noncancelable lease term variable payments for occupancyrelated costs real estate taxes insurance and contingent rent are not included above in addition 231 million of leases on an undiscounted basis that have not yet commenced with terms of 2 to 10 years beginning in fiscal 2022 are not included above 

3 interest payment obligations represent required interest payments on longterm debt and the interest portion of payments on finance leases amounts exclude amortization of debt issuance costs debt discounts and acquisition costs that would be included in interest expense in the consolidated financial statements 

4 inventory obligations represent binding commitments to purchase finished goods raw materials and contract production that are payable upon delivery of the inventory to vf this obligation excludes the amount included in accounts payable at march 2021 related to inventory purchases 

vf had other financial commitments at the end of fiscal 2021 that are not included in the above table but may require the use of funds under certain circumstances 

• 1181 million of surety bonds custom bonds standby letters of credit and international bank guarantees are not included in the table above because they represent contingent guarantees of performance under selfinsurance and other programs and would only be drawn upon if vf were to fail to meet its other obligations 

• purchase orders for goods or services in the ordinary course of business are not included in the above table because they represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding commitments 

management believes that vf’s cash and investment balances and expected funds to be provided by operating activities as well 

as its global credit facility additional borrowing capacity and access to capital markets taken as a whole provide i adequate liquidity to meet all of its current and longterm obligations when due ii adequate liquidity to fund capital expenditures and to maintain the planned dividend and iii flexibility to meet investment opportunities that may arise there continues to be significant uncertainty about the duration and extent of the impact of covid19 however management believes that vf has sufficient liquidity and flexibility to operate during and after the disruptions caused by the covid19 pandemic 

vf does not participate in transactions with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships established to facilitate offbalance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes 

vf corporation fiscal 2021 form 10k 35 

table of conte nts 



vf is exposed to risks in the ordinary course of business management regularly assesses and manages exposures to these risks through operating and financing activities and when appropriate by i taking advantage of natural hedges within vf ii purchasing insurance from commercial carriers or iii using derivative financial instruments some potential risks are discussed below 

insured risks 

vf is selfinsured for a significant portion of its employee medical workers’ compensation vehicle and general liability exposures vf purchases insurance from highlyrated commercial carriers to cover other risks including directors and officers property and umbrella and to establish stoploss limits on selfinsurance arrangements 

cash and equivalents risks 

vf had 8158 million of cash and equivalents at the end of fiscal 2021 management continually monitors the credit ratings of the financial institutions with whom vf conducts business similarly management monitors the credit quality of cash equivalents 

defined benefit pension plan risks 

at the end of fiscal 2021 vf’s defined benefit pension plans were overfunded by a net total of 137 million the overfunded status includes a 1176 million liability related to our us unfunded supplemental defined benefit plan 584 million of net liabilities related to our nonus defined benefit plans and a 1897 million net asset related to our us qualified defined benefit plan vf will continue to evaluate the funded status and future funding requirements of these plans which depends in part on the future performance of the plans’ investment portfolios management believes that vf has sufficient liquidity to make any required contributions to the pension plans in future years 

vf’s reported earnings are subject to risks due to the volatility of its pension cost income which has ranged in recent years from cost of 397 million in the year ended march 201 9 to income of 57 million in the year ended march 2021 these fluctuations are primarily due to the decrease in service costs due to the freeze of future benefit accruals in the us qualified and supplemental defined benefit plans as of december 31 2018 and varying amounts of actuarial gains and losses that are deferred and amortized to future years’ expense the assumptions that impact actuarial gains and losses include the rate of return on investments held by the pension plans the discount rate used to value participant liabilities and demographic characteristics of the participants 

in fiscal 2019 vf approved a freeze of all future benefit accruals under the us qualified defined benefit pension plan and supplemental defined benefit pension plan effective december 31 2018 during the year ended march 2020 vf took an additional step in managing pension risk by offering former employees in the us qualified plan a lumpsum option to receive a distribution of their deferred vested benefits the us qualified plan participants were reduced by 10 as a result of this offer no additional funding of the pension plan was required as all distributions were paid out of existing plan assets and the 

plan’s funded status remained materially unchanged refer to note 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

vf has taken a series of steps to manage the risk and volatility in the pension plans and their impact on the financial statements the us qualified and supplemental defined benefit plans were closed to new entrants in 2005 and all future benefit accruals were frozen as of december 31 2018 the investment strategy of the us qualified plan continues to define dynamic asset allocation targets that are dependent upon changes in the plan’s funded status capital market expectations and risk tolerance management will continue to evaluate actions that may help to reduce vf’s risks related to its defined benefit plans 

interest rate risks 

vf limits the risk of interest rate fluctuations by managing the mix of fixed and variable interest rate debt in addition vf may use derivative financial instruments to manage risk since all of vf’s longterm debt has fixed interest rates the exposure relates to changes in interest rates on variable rate shortterm borrowings which averaged approximately 2440 million during fiscal 2021 however any change in interest rates would also affect interest income earned on vf’s cash equivalents based on the average amount of variable rate borrowings and cash equivalents during fiscal 2021 the effect of a hypothetical 1 increase in interest rates would be an increase in reported net income of approximately 150 million and a hypothetical 1 decrease in interest rates would be a decrease in reported net income of approximately 150 million 

foreign currency exchange rate risks 

vf is a global enterprise subject to the risk of foreign currency fluctuations approximately 50 of vf’s revenues in the year ended march 2021 were generated in international markets most of vf’s foreign businesses operate in functional currencies other than the us dollar in periods where the us dollar strengthens relative to the euro or other foreign currencies where vf has operations there is a negative impact on vf’s operating results upon translation of those foreign operating results into the us dollar as discussed later in this section management hedges vf’s investments in certain foreign operations and foreign currency transactions 

the reported values of assets and liabilities in these foreign businesses are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for net advances to and investments in vf’s foreign businesses that are considered to be longterm the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on those longterm advances is deferred as a component of accumulated oci in stockholders’ equity the us dollar value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries fluctuates with changes in the underlying functional currencies in february 2020 vf issued €10 billion of eurodenominated fixedrate notes and in september 2016 vf issued €850 million of eurodenominated fixedrate notes these notes have been designated as net investment hedges of vf’s investment in certain foreign operations because this debt qualified as a nonderivative hedging instrument foreign currency transaction gains or losses of the debt are deferred in the foreign currency translation and other component of accumulated oci as an offset to the foreign currency translation adjustments on the hedged investments 

36 vf corporation fiscal 2021 form 10k 

table of conte nts 

any amounts deferred in accumulated oci will remain until the hedged investment is sold or substantially liquidated 

vf monitors net foreign currency market exposures and enters into derivative foreign currency contracts to hedge the effects of exchange rate fluctuations for a significant portion of forecasted foreign currency cash flows or specific foreign currency transactions relating to crossborder inventory purchases production costs product sales operating costs and intercompany royalty payments vf’s practice is to buy or sell foreign currency exchange contracts that cover up to 80 of foreign currency exposures for periods of up to 24 months currently vf uses only foreign exchange forward contracts but may use options or collars in the future this use of financial instruments allows management to reduce the overall exposure to risks from exchange rate fluctuations on vf’s cash flows and earnings since gains and losses on these contracts will offset losses and gains on the transactions being hedged 

for cash flow hedging contracts outstanding at the end of fiscal 2021 if there were a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates compared to rates at the end of fiscal 2021 it would result in a change in fair value of those contracts of approximately 234 million however any change in the fair value of the hedging contracts would be substantially offset by a change in the fair value of the underlying hedged exposure impacted by the currency rate changes 

counterparty risks 

vf is exposed to creditrelated losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to derivative hedging instruments to manage this risk we have established 

counterparty credit guidelines and only enter into derivative transactions with financial institutions that have ‘a minusa3’ investment grade credit ratings or better vf continually monitors the credit rating of and limits the amount hedged with each counterparty additionally management utilizes a portfolio of financial institutions to minimize exposure to potential counterparty defaults and adjusts positions as necessary vf also monitors counterparty risk for derivative contracts within the defined benefit pension plans 

commodity price risks 

vf is exposed to market risks for the pricing of cotton leather rubber wool and other materials which we either purchase directly or in a converted form such as fabric or shoe soles to manage risks of commodity price changes management negotiates prices in advance when possible vf has not historically managed commodity price exposures by using derivative instruments 

deferred compensation and related investment security risks 

vf has nonqualified deferred compensation plans in which liabilities to the plans’ participants are based on the market values of the participants’ selection of a hypothetical portfolio of investment funds vf invests in a portfolio of securities that substantially mirrors the participants’ investment selections the increases and decreases in deferred compensation liabilities are substantially offset by corresponding increases and decreases in the market value of vf’s investments resulting in an insignificant net exposure to operating results and financial position 



vf has chosen accounting policies that management believes are appropriate to accurately and fairly report vf’s operating results and financial position in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us vf applies these accounting policies in a consistent manner significant accounting policies are summarized in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

the application of these accounting policies requires that vf make estimates and assumptions about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses contingent assets and liabilities and related disclosures these estimates assumptions and judgments are based on historical experience current trends and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis because vf’s business cycle 

is relatively short ie from the date that inventory is received until that inventory is sold and the trade receivable is collected actual results related to most estimates are known within a few months after any balance sheet date in addition vf may retain outside specialists to assist in valuations of business acquisitions and impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets if actual results ultimately differ from previous estimates the revisions are included in results of operations when the actual amounts become known 

vf believes the following accounting policies involve the most significant management estimates assumptions and judgments used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements or are the most sensitive to change from outside factors the application of these critical accounting policies and estimates is discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors 



vf’s inventories are primarily comprised of finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value cost includes all material labor and overhead costs incurred to purchase or manufacture the finished goods overhead allocated to manufactured product is based on the normal capacity of plants and does not include amounts related to idle capacity or abnormal production inefficiencies vf performs a detailed review at each business unit at least quarterly of all inventories on the basis of individual styles or individual stylesizecolor 

stock keeping units to identify slow moving or excess products discontinued and tobediscontinued products and offquality merchandise this review matches inventory on hand plus current production and purchase commitments with current and expected future sales orders management performs an evaluation to estimate net realizable value using a systematic and consistent methodology of forecasting future demand market conditions and selling prices less costs of disposal if the estimated net realizable value is less than cost vf provides an 

vf corporation fiscal 2021 form 10k 37 

allowance to reflect the lower value of that inventory this methodology recognizes inventory exposures at the time such losses are evident rather than at the time goods are actually sold historically these estimates of future demand and selling prices have not varied significantly from actual results due to vf’s timely identification and ability to rapidly dispose of these distressed inventories 

existence of physical inventory is verified through periodic physical inventory counts and ongoing cycle counts at most locations throughout the year vf provides for estimated inventory losses that have likely occurred since the last physical inventory date historically physical inventory shrinkage has not been material 



vf accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting under the acquisition method the consolidated financial statements reflect the operations of an acquired business starting from the closing date of the acquisition all assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date vf allocates the purchase price of an acquired business to the fair values of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed with any excess purchase price recorded as goodwill contingent consideration if any is included within the purchase price and is recognized at its fair value on the acquisition date 

the application of the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations and determination of fair value requires management to make judgments and may involve the use of significant estimates including assumptions related to estimated future revenues growth rates cash flows discount rates and royalty rates among other items vf generally evaluates fair value at acquisition using three valuation techniques  the replacement cost market and income methods  and weights the valuation methods based on what is most appropriate in the circumstances the process of assigning fair values particularly to acquired intangible assets is highly subjective vf also typically utilizes thirdparty valuation specialists to assist management in the determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed management estimates of fair value are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable but are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result actual results may differ from estimates if the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be exposed to potential impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill as discussed in the longlived assets including intangible assets and goodwill section below 

during the measurement period which is up to one year from the acquisition date adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed may be recorded with the corresponding offset to goodwill 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 vf completed the acquisition of supreme holdings inc supreme the preliminary purchase price for the transaction was 24 billion which is comprised of 22 billion in cash and 02 billion for the estimated fair value of contingent consideration the transaction also included 02 billion of cash acquired by vf management allocated the preliminary purchase price of the acquired supreme business to the preliminary estimated fair values of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities at the date of acquisition which resulted in excess purchase price of 125 billion that has been recorded as goodwill the acquired assets include the estimated fair value of 120 billion for the supreme ® trademark which is an identifiable intangible asset management believes to have an indefinite life the estimated fair value of the supreme ® trademark was determined using the relieffromroyalty method of the income valuation approach which required the use of significant estimates and assumptions including future revenues growth rates royalty rate tax rates and discount rate associated with the acquired intangible asset managements estimates and assumptions utilized internal forecasts of supremes future business performance and relevant market information management also utilized a thirdparty valuation specialist to assist in the determination of the estimated fair value of the supreme ® trademark 

management believes the assumptions used in determining the estimated fair value of the supreme ® trademark are reasonable but are inherently uncertain and unpredictable as a result actual results may differ from estimates future business and economic conditions as well as significant changes in any of the assumptions used to estimate the acquisition date fair value of the supreme ® trademark may result in a future impairment charge that could have a material effect on vf’s consolidated financial position and results of operations 

refer to note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to acquisitions 



definitelived assets 

vf’s depreciation policies for property plant and equipment reflect judgments on the estimated economic lives and residual value if any vf’s amortization policies for definitelived intangible assets reflect judgments on the estimated amounts and duration of future cash flows expected to be generated by those assets in evaluating the amortizable life for customer relationship intangible assets management considers historical attrition patterns for various groups of customers in determining the lease term used to amortize operating lease rightofuse assets vf considers initial terms and any renewal or termination options that may exist when deemed reasonably 

certain the renewal and termination options are included in the determination of lease term 

vf’s policy is to review property plant and equipment definitelived intangible assets and operating lease rightofuse assets for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable vf tests for potential impairment at the asset or asset group level which is the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent vf measures recoverability of the carrying value of an asset or asset group by comparison to the estimated pretax undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 

38 vf corporation fiscal 2021 form 10k 

if the forecasted pretax undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset are not expected to be adequate to recover the asset’s carrying value a fair value analysis must be performed and an impairment charge is recorded if there is an excess of the asset’s carrying value over its estimated fair value 

when testing property plant and equipment for potential impairment vf uses the incomebased discounted cash flow method using the estimated cash flows of the respective asset or asset group the estimated pretax undiscounted cash flows of the asset or asset group through the end of its useful life are compared to its carrying value if the pretax undiscounted cash flows of the asset or asset group exceed its carrying value there is no impairment charge if the pretax undiscounted cash flows of the asset or asset group are less than its carrying value the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group is calculated based on the aftertax discounted cash flows using an appropriate weighted average cost of capital wacc and an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group and its carrying value 

when testing customer relationship intangible assets for potential impairment management considers historical customer attrition rates and projected revenues and profitability related to customers that existed at acquisition management uses the multiperiod excess earnings method which is a specific application of the discounted cash flow method to value customer relationship assets the estimated pretax undiscounted cash flows of the asset through the end of its useful life are compared to its carrying value if the pretax undiscounted cash flows of the asset exceed its carrying value there is no impairment charge if the pretax undiscounted cash flows of the asset are less than its carrying value the estimated fair value of the asset is calculated based on the present value of the aftertax cash flows expected to be generated by the customer relationship asset after deducting contributory asset charges and an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value of the asset and its carrying value 

when testing operating lease rightofuse assets for potential impairment vf uses the incomebased discounted cash flow method using the estimated cash flows of the respective asset or asset group the estimated pretax undiscounted cash flows of the asset or asset group through the end of its useful life are compared to its carrying value if the pretax undiscounted cash flows of the asset exceed its carrying value there is no impairment charge if the pretax undiscounted cash flows of the asset or asset group are less than its carrying value the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group is calculated considering what a market participant would pay to lease the asset for its highest and best use and an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group and its carrying value the impairment loss is allocated to the longlived assets of the group on a prorata basis using the relative carrying amounts of those assets 

indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill 

fair value for acquired intangible assets is generally based on the present value of expected cash flows indefinitelived trademark or trade name intangible assets collectively referred to herein as “trademarks” represent individually acquired trademarks some of which are registered in multiple countries goodwill represents the excess of cost of an acquired business 

over the fair values of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed and is assigned at the reporting unit level 

vf’s policy is to evaluate indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill for possible impairment as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of such assets may be below their carrying amount as part of its annual impairment testing vf may elect to assess qualitative factors as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform quantitative impairment testing if management’s assessment of these qualitative factors indicates that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset or reporting unit is less than its carrying value then no further testing is required otherwise the intangible asset or reporting unit must be quantitatively tested for impairment 

an indefinitelived intangible asset is quantitatively tested for possible impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value fair value of an indefinitelived trademark is based on an income approach using the relieffromroyalty method under this method forecasted revenues for products sold with the trademark are assigned a royalty rate that would be charged to license the trademark in lieu of ownership and the estimated fair value is calculated as the present value of those forecasted royalties avoided by owning the trademark the appropriate discount rate is based on the reporting unit’s wacc that considers market participant assumptions plus a spread that factors in the risk of the intangible asset the royalty rate is selected based on consideration of i royalty rates included in active license agreements if applicable ii royalty rates received by market participants in the apparel industry and iii the current performance of the reporting unit if the estimated fair value of the trademark intangible asset exceeds its carrying value there is no impairment charge if the estimated fair value of the trademark is less than its carrying value an impairment charge would be recognized for the difference 

goodwill is quantitatively evaluated for possible impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value reporting units are businesses with discrete financial information that is available and reviewed by management 

for goodwill impairment testing vf estimates the fair value of a reporting unit using both incomebased and marketbased valuation methods the incomebased approach is based on the reporting unit’s forecasted future cash flows that are discounted to present value using the reporting unit’s wacc as discussed above for the marketbased approach management uses both the guideline company and similar transaction methods the guideline company method analyzes market multiples of revenues and earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” for a group of comparable public companies the market multiples used in the valuation are based on the relative strengths and weaknesses of the reporting unit compared to the selected guideline companies under the similar transactions method valuation multiples are calculated utilizing actual transaction prices and revenueebitda data from target companies deemed similar to the reporting unit 

based on the range of estimated fair values developed from the income and marketbased methods vf determines the estimated fair value for the reporting unit if the estimated fair 

vf corporation fiscal 2021 form 10k 39 

value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value the goodwill is not impaired and no further review is required however if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value vf calculates the impairment loss as the difference between the carrying value of the reporting unit and the estimated fair value 

the incomebased fair value methodology requires management’s assumptions and judgments regarding economic conditions in the markets in which vf operates and conditions in the capital markets many of which are outside of management’s control at the reporting unit level fair value estimation requires management’s assumptions and judgments regarding the effects of overall economic conditions on the specific reporting unit along with assessment of the reporting unit’s strategies and forecasts of future cash flows forecasts of individual reporting unit cash flows involve management’s estimates and assumptions regarding 

• annual cash flows on a debtfree basis arising from future revenues and profitability changes in working capital capital spending and income taxes for at least a 10year forecast period 

• a terminal growth rate for years beyond the forecast period the terminal growth rate is selected based on consideration of growth rates used in the forecast period historical performance of the reporting unit and economic conditions 

• a discount rate that reflects the risks inherent in realizing the forecasted cash flows a discount rate considers the riskfree rate of return on longterm treasury securities the risk premium associated with investing in equity securities of comparable companies the beta obtained from comparable companies and the cost of debt for investment grade issuers in addition the discount rate may consider any companyspecific risk in achieving the prospective financial information 

under the marketbased fair value methodology judgment is required in evaluating market multiples and recent transactions management believes that the assumptions used for its impairment tests are representative of those that would be used by market participants performing similar valuations of vf’s reporting units 

fiscal 2021 impairment testing 

management performed its annual goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment testing as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 vf elected to bypass the qualitative analysis for the kipling reporting unit goodwill and indefinitelived trademark intangible asset see additional discussion in the kipling reporting unit and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment analysis section below management performed a qualitative analysis for all other reporting units and trademark intangible assets as discussed below in the “other reporting units  qualitative impairment analysis” section 

kipling reporting unit and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment analysis 

in conjunction with vfs annual goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment testing as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 management performed a quantitative impairment analysis of the kipling reporting unit goodwill and indefinitelived trademark intangible asset this 

decision to bypass the optional qualitative impairment assessment and proceed directly to a quantitative impairment analysis was based on continued deterioration in kipling financial results based on the analysis management concluded the goodwill and indefinitelived trademark intangible asset were not impaired for goodwill the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by 19 the estimated fair value of the indefinitelived trademark intangible asset exceeded its carrying value by a significant amount the carrying values of the reporting unit goodwill and indefinitelived trademark intangible asset at the december 27 2020 testing date were 1929 million and 501 million respectively 

the kipling ® brand acquired in 2004 offers handbags luggage backpacks totes and accessories products are sold globally through department specialty and luggage stores independentlyoperated partnership stores independent distributors concession retail stores vfoperated stores on websites with strategic digital partners and online the kipling reporting unit is included in the active reportable segment 

managements revenue and profitability forecasts used in the kipling reporting unit and indefinitelived trademark intangible asset valuations considered historical performance strategic initiatives and industry trends assumptions used in the valuations were similar to those that would be used by market participants performing independent valuations of the business 

key assumptions developed by management and used in the quantitative analysis of the kipling reporting unit and indefinitelived trademark intangible asset include 

• financial projections and future cash flows including a base year reflecting deterioration of actual results including the impact of covid19 delayed and extended recovery from the covid19 pandemic in relation to other vf brands ultimately trending towards growth rates and profitability inline with historical trends and terminal growth rates based on the expected longterm growth rate of the brand 

• tax rates based on the statutory rates for the countries in which the brand operates and the related intellectual property is domiciled 

• royalty rates based on market data as well as active license agreements with similar vf brands and 

• marketbased discount rates 

the valuation model used by management in the impairment testing assumes recovery over an extended period of time from the recent downturn in the brands operating results including the impact of the covid19 pandemic and the return to growth rates and profitability more inline with historical operating trends if the brand is unable to achieve the financial projections an impairment on the indefinitelived trademark intangible asset or the reporting unit goodwill could occur in the future 

other reporting units  qualitative impairment analysis 

for all other reporting units vf elected to perform a qualitative assessment during the annual goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment testing to determine whether it was more likely than not that the goodwill and indefinitelived trademark intangible assets in those reporting units were impaired in this qualitative assessment vf considered relevant events and circumstances for each reporting unit including i current year results and performance versus managements 

40 vf corporation fiscal 2021 form 10k 

annual and strategic plans ii financial outlook based on the latest strategic plan iii changes in the reporting unit carrying value since prior year and the amounts relative to the size of the respective business iv industry and market conditions in which the reporting unit operates v macroeconomic conditions including discount rate changes and vi changes in products or services offered by the reporting unit if applicable performance in recent years was compared to forecasts included in prior valuations based on the results of the qualitative assessment vf concluded it was not more likely than not the carrying values of the goodwill and indefinitelived trademark intangible assets were greater than their fair values and that further quantitative testing was not necessary 

management’s use of estimates and assumptions 

management made its estimates based on information available as of the date of our assessments using assumptions we believe market participants would use in performing an independent valuation of the business it is possible that vf’s conclusions regarding impairment or recoverability of goodwill or indefinite 

lived intangible assets in any reporting unit could change in future periods there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions used in our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment testing will prove to be accurate predictions of the future if for example i the businesses do not perform as projected ii overall economic conditions in fiscal 2022 or future years vary from current assumptions including changes in discount rates iii business conditions or strategies for a specific reporting unit change from current assumptions including loss of major customers iv investors require higher rates of return on equity investments in the marketplace or v enterprise values of comparable publicly traded companies or actual sales transactions of comparable companies were to decline resulting in lower multiples of revenues and ebitda 

a future impairment charge for goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets could have a material effect on vf’s consolidated financial position and results of operations 



as a global company vf is subject to income taxes and files income tax returns in over 100 us and foreign jurisdictions each year due to economic and political conditions tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change the company could be subject to changes in its tax rates the adoption of new us or international tax legislation or changes in interpretation of existing tax laws and regulations or rulings by courts or government authorities leading to exposure to additional tax liabilities in particular tax authorities and the courts have increased their focus on income earned in no or lowtax jurisdictions or income that is not taxed in any jurisdiction tax authorities have also become skeptical of special tax rulings provided to companies offering lower taxes than may be applicable in other countries vf makes an ongoing assessment to identify any significant exposure related to increases in tax rates in the jurisdictions in which vf operates 

furthermore in february 2015 the european union commission “eu” opened a state aid investigation into belgium’s tax rulings on january 11 2016 the eu announced its decision that these rulings were illegal and ordered that tax benefits granted under these rulings should be collected from the affected companies including vf on march 22 2016 the belgium government filed an appeal seeking annulment of the eu decision additionally on june 21 2016 vf europe bvba filed its own application for annulment of the eu decision on december 22 2016 belgium adopted a law which entitled the belgium tax authorities to issue tax assessments and demand timely payments from companies which benefited from the excess profits regime on january 10 2017 vf europe bvba received an assessment for €319 million tax and interest related to excess profits benefits received in prior years vf europe bvba remitted €319 million 339 million on january 13 2017 which was recorded as an income tax receivable in 2017 based on the expected success of the aforementioned requests for annulment an additional assessment of €31 million 38 million was received and paid in january 2018 on february 14 2019 the general court annulled the eu decision and on april 26 2019 the eu appealed the general court’s annulment both listed requests for annulment remain open and unresolved additionally the eu has initiated proceedings related to individual rulings granted by belgium including the ruling 

granted to vf if this matter is adversely resolved these amounts will not be collected by vf 

the calculation of income tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations which are subject to legal interpretation and significant management judgment vf’s income tax returns are regularly examined by federal state and foreign tax authorities and those audits may result in proposed adjustments vf has reviewed all issues raised upon examination as well as any exposure for issues that may be raised in future examinations vf has evaluated these potential issues under the “morelikelythannot” standard of the accounting literature a tax position is recognized if it meets this standard and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized such judgments and estimates may change based on audit settlements court cases and interpretation of tax laws and regulations income tax expense could be materially affected to the extent vf prevails in a tax position or when the statute of limitations expires for a tax position for which a liability for unrecognized tax benefits or valuation allowances have been established or to the extent vf is required to pay amounts greater than the established liability for unrecognized tax benefits vf does not currently anticipate any material impact on earnings from the ultimate resolution of income tax uncertainties there are no accruals for general or unknown tax expenses 

as of march 2021 vf has 3264 million of gross deferred income tax assets related to operating loss and capital loss carryforwards and 2700 million of valuation allowances against those assets realization of deferred tax assets related to operating loss and capital loss carryforwards is dependent on future taxable income in specific jurisdictions the amount and timing of which are uncertain and on possible changes in tax laws if management believes that vf will not be able to generate sufficient taxable income or capital gains to offset losses during the carryforward periods vf records valuation allowances to reduce those deferred tax assets to amounts expected to be ultimately realized if in a future period management determines that the amount of deferred tax assets to be realized differs from the net recorded amount vf would 

vf corporation fiscal 2021 form 10k 41 

record an adjustment to income tax expense in that future period 

on may 19 2019 switzerland voted to approve the federal act on tax reform and ahv financing “swiss tax act” provisions of the swiss tax act were enacted for swiss federal purposes during the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and later enacted for certain cantons during the fourth quarter in addition to changes to the federal and cantonal tax rates there were transitional measures allowing companies to recognize a stepup in tax 

basis that is subsequently amortized over a period of time calculation of the additional tax basis involves estimates and application of specific guidelines determined by the swiss federal authorities as well as through ongoing discussions with swiss cantonal tax authorities these provisions resulted in adjustments to deferred tax assets and liabilities such that a net tax benefit of 936 million was recorded in the year ended march 2020

our fullprice retail stores allow us to display a brand’s full line of products with fixtures and imagery that support the brand’s positioning and promise to consumers these experiences provide high visibility for our brands and products and enable us to stay close to the needs and preferences of our consumers the complete and impactful presentation of products in our stores also helps to increase sellthrough of vf products at our wholesale customers due to increased brand awareness education and visibility vfoperated fullprice stores generally provide gross margins that are well above vf averages 

 

in addition vf operates outlet stores in both premium outlet malls and more traditional valuebased locations these outlet stores carry merchandise that is specifically designed for sale in our outlet stores and serve an important role in our overall inventory management and profitability by allowing vf to sell a significant portion of excess discontinued and outofseason products at better prices than otherwise available from outside parties while maintaining the integrity of our brands

in addition to our directtoconsumer operations our licensees distributors and other independent parties own and operate approximately 3000 partnership stores these are primarily monobrand retail locations selling vf products that have the appearance of vfoperated stores most of these partnership stores are located in europe and asia and are concentrated in the timberland ®  the north face ®  vans ®  dickies ®  kipling ® and napapijri ® brands 



as part of our strategy of expanding market penetration of vfowned brands we enter into licensing agreements with independent parties for specific apparel and complementary product categories when such arrangements provide more effective manufacturing distribution and marketing than could be achieved internally we provide support to these business partners and ensure the integrity of our brand names by taking an active role in the design quality control advertising marketing and distribution of licensed products 

 

licensing arrangements relate to a broad range of vf brands license agreements are for fixed terms of generally 3 to 5 years with conditional renewal options each licensee pays royalties to vf based on its sales of licensed products with most agreements providing for a minimum royalty requirement royalties generally range from 4 to 10 of the licensing partners’ net licensed products sales royalty income was 574 million in the year ended march 2020 less than 1 of total revenues primarily from the vans ®  dickies ® and timberland ® brands 



product design and innovation including fit fabric finish and quality are important elements across our businesses these functions are performed by employees located in our global supply chain organization and our branded business units across the globe 

vf’s centralized global supply chain organization is responsible for producing procuring and delivering products to our customers vf is highly skilled in managing the complexities associated with our global supply chain in the year ended march 2020 vf sourced or produced approximately 364 million units spread across our brands our products were obtained from approximately 300 independent contractor manufacturing facilities in approximately 40 countries and from 4 vfoperated manufacturing facilities additionally we operate 23 distribution centers and 1379 retail stores managing this complexity is made possible by the use of a network of information systems for product development forecasting order management and warehouse management along with our core enterprise resource management platforms 

in the year ended march 2020 94 of our units were obtained from independent contractors and 6 were manufactured in vfowned facilities products obtained from contractors in the western hemisphere generally have a higher cost than products obtained from contractors in asia however contracting in the western hemisphere gives us greater flexibility shorter lead times and allows for lower inventory levels for the us market the use of contracted production with different geographic regions and cost structures provides a flexible approach to product sourcing we will continue to manage our supply chain from a global perspective and adjust as needed to changes in the global production environment 

 

independent contractors generally own the raw materials and ship finished readyforsale products to vf these contractors are engaged through vf sourcing hubs in hong kong with satellite offices across asia and panama these hubs are responsible for managing the manufacturing and procurement of product supplier oversight product quality assurance sustainability within the supply chain responsible sourcing and transportation and shipping functions in addition our hubs leverage proprietary knowledge and technology to enable certain contractors to more effectively control costs and improve labor efficiency 

management continually monitors political risks and developments related to duties tariffs and quotas we limit vf’s sourcing exposure through among other measures i diversifying production among countries and contractors ii sourcing production to merchandise categories where product is readily available and iii sourcing from countries with tariff preference and free trade agreements vf does not directly or indirectly source products from suppliers in countries that are prohibited by the us state department 

no single supplier represented more than 7 of our total cost of goods sold during fiscal 2020 

vf operates manufacturing facilities in mexico honduras and the dominican republic which are used to produce a portion of footwear and other products for these owned production facilities we purchase raw materials from numerous us and international suppliers to meet our production needs raw materials include products made from cotton leather rubber wool synthetics and blends of cotton and synthetic yarn as well as thread and trim product identification buttons zippers snaps eyelets and laces 

4 vf corporation fiscal 2020 form 10k 

in some instances we contract the sewing of vfowned raw materials into finished product with independent contractors fixed price commitments for fabric and certain supplies are generally set on a quarterly basis for the next quarter’s purchases 

the vfoperated production facilities as well as all independent contractor facilities that manufacture vf products must comply with vf’s global compliance principles these principles established in 1997 and consistent with international labor standards are a set of strict standards covering legal and ethical business practices worker age work hours health and safety conditions environmental standards and compliance with local laws and regulations in addition our owned factories must also undergo certification by the independent nonprofit organization worldwide responsible accredited production “wrap” which promotes global ethics in manufacturing 

vf through its contractor monitoring program audits the activities of the independent businesses and contractors that produce vf products at locations across the globe each of the approximately 300 independent contractor facilities including those serving our independent licensees must be precertified before producing vf products this precertification includes passing a factory inspection and signing a vf terms of engagement agreement we maintain an ongoing audit program to ensure compliance with these requirements by using dedicated internal staff and externally contracted firms additional information about vf’s code of 

 

business conduct global compliance principles terms of engagement and environmental compliance guidelines along with a global compliance report is available on the vf website at wwwvfccom 

vf did not experience difficulty in fulfilling its raw material and contracting production needs during fiscal 2020 absent any material changes vf believes it would be able to largely offset any increases in product costs through i the continuing shift in the mix of its business to higher margin brands geographies and channels of distribution ii increases in the prices of its products and iii cost reduction efforts the loss of any one supplier or contractor would not have a significant adverse effect on our business 

product is shipped from our independent suppliers and vfoperated manufacturing facilities to distribution centers around the world in some instances product is shipped directly to our customers most distribution centers are operated by vf and some support more than one brand a portion of our distribution needs are met by contract distribution centers 

our largest distribution centers are located in visalia california and prague czech republic additionally we operate 21 other owned or leased distribution centers primarily in the us but also in belgium canada china mexico the netherlands and the united kingdom 



vf’s quarterly operating results vary due to the seasonality of our individual brands and are historically stronger in the second half of the calendar year on a quarterly basis in fiscal 2020  revenues ranged from a low of 20 of full year revenues in the first fiscal quarter to a high of 30 in the second fiscal quarter while operating margin ranged from a low of 12 in the fourth fiscal quarter to a high of 17 in the second fiscal quarter this variation results primarily from the seasonal influences on revenues of our outdoor segment where 13 of the segment’s revenues occurred in the first fiscal quarter compared to 33 in the second fiscal quarter of fiscal 2020  the fourth fiscal quarter results were also negatively impacted by the novel coronavirus covid19 global pandemic with changes in our mix of business and the growth of our retail 

 

operations historical quarterly revenue and profit trends may not be indicative of future trends 

working capital requirements vary throughout the year working capital typically increases early in the calendar year as inventory builds to support peak shipping periods and then moderates later in the year as those inventories are sold and accounts receivable are collected cash provided by operating activities is substantially higher in the second half of the calendar year due to higher net income during that period and reduced working capital requirements particularly during the fourth quarter of the calendar year

 item 1a risk factors 

tableend

the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating vf’s business and the forwardlooking statements contained in this form 10k any of the following risks could materially adversely affect vf’s business its operating results and its financial condition 

vf’s revenues and profits depend on the level of consumer spending for apparel and footwear which is sensitive to global economic conditions and other factors a decline in consumer spending could have a material adverse effect on vf 

the success of vf’s business depends on consumer spending on apparel and footwear and there are a number of factors that influence consumer spending including actual and perceived economic conditions disposable consumer income interest rates consumer credit availability unemployment stock market performance weather conditions energy prices public health issues including the current covid19 pandemic consumer discretionary spending patterns and tax rates in the international national regional and local markets where vf’s products are sold decreased consumer spending could result in reduced demand for our products reduced orders from customers for our products order cancellations lower revenues higher discounts increased inventories and lower gross margins the uncertain state of the global economy continues to impact businesses around the world most acutely in emerging markets and developing economies if global economic and financial market conditions do not improve adverse economic trends or other factors could negatively impact the level of consumer spending which could have a material adverse impact on vf 

widespread outbreak of an illness or any other public health crisis including the recent coronavirus covid19 global pandemic could materially and adversely affect and has materially and adversely affected our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business has been and will continue to be impacted by the effects of the covid19 global pandemic in countries where we operate or our suppliers thirdparty service providers consumers or customers are located these effects include recommendations or mandates from governmental authorities to close businesses limit travel avoid large gatherings or to selfquarantine as well as temporary closures and decreased operations of the facilities of our suppliers service providers and customers the impacts on 

 

us have included and in the future could include but are not limited to 



8 vf corporation fiscal 2020 form 10k 

their ability to do so which may be caused by their own financial or operational difficulties including business failure or insolvency and collectability of existing receivables and 

 any of these impacts could place limitations on our ability to execute on our business plan and materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations we continue to monitor the situation and may adjust our current policies and procedures as more information and guidance become available regarding the evolving situation the impact of covid19 may also exacerbate other risks discussed in this “risk factors” section any of which could have a material effect on us this situation is changing rapidly and additional impacts may arise that we are not aware of currently 

the apparel and footwear industries are highly competitive and vf’s success depends on its ability to gauge consumer preferences and product trends and to respond to constantly changing markets 

vf competes with numerous apparel and footwear brands and manufacturers competition is generally based upon brand name recognition price design product quality selection service and purchasing convenience some of our competitors are larger and have more resources than vf in some product categories and regions in addition vf competes directly with the private label brands of its wholesale customers vf’s ability to compete within the apparel and footwear industries depends on our ability to 

 failure to compete effectively or to keep pace with rapidly changing consumer preferences markets and product trends could have a material adverse effect on vf’s business financial condition and results of operations moreover there are significant shifts underway in the wholesale and retail ecommerce and retail store channels vf may not be able to manage its brands within and across channels sufficiently which could have a material adverse effect on vf’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

vf’s business and the success of its products could be harmed if vf is unable to maintain the images of its brands 

vf’s success to date has been due in large part to the growth of its brands’ images and vf’s customers’ connection to its brands if we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to changing consumer demand the names and images of our brands may be impaired even if we react appropriately to changes in consumer preferences consumers may consider our brands’ images to be outdated or associate our brands with styles that are no longer popular in addition brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of qualities including merchandise quality and corporate integrity negative claims or publicity regarding vf its brands or its products including licensed products could adversely affect our reputation and sales regardless of whether such claims are accurate social media which accelerates the dissemination of information can increase the challenges of responding to negative claims in the past many apparel companies have experienced periods of rapid growth in sales and earnings followed by periods of declining sales and losses our businesses may be similarly affected in the future in addition we have sponsorship contracts with a number of athletes musicians and celebrities and feature those individuals in our advertising and marketing efforts failure to continue to obtain or maintain highquality sponsorships and endorsers could harm our business in addition actions taken by those individuals associated with our products could harm their reputations which could adversely affect the images of our brands 

vf’s revenues and cash requirements are affected by the seasonal nature of its business 

vf’s business is seasonal with a higher proportion of revenues and operating cash flows generated during the second half of the calendar year which includes the fall and holiday selling seasons poor sales in the second half of the calendar year would have a material adverse effect on vf’s full year operating results and cause higher inventories in addition fluctuations in sales and operating income in any fiscal quarter are affected by the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales 

vf’s profitability may decline as a result of increasing pressure on margins 

the apparel industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors including intense competition consolidation in the retail industry rising commodity and conversion costs pressure from retailers to reduce the costs of products changes in consumer demand and shifts to online shopping and purchasing consumers may increasingly seek markdown allowances incentives and other forms of economic support if these factors cause us to reduce our sales prices to retailers and consumers and we fail to sufficiently reduce our product costs or operating expenses vf’s profitability will decline this could have a material adverse effect on vf’s results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

vf may not succeed in its business strategy 

one of vf’s key strategic objectives is growth we seek to grow organically and through acquisitions we seek to grow by building our lifestyle brands expanding our share with winning customers stretching vf’s brands to new regions managing costs leveraging our supply chain and information technology capabilities across vf and expanding our directtoconsumer business including 

vf corporation fiscal 2020 form 10k 9 

opening new stores remodeling and expanding our existing stores and growing our ecommerce business however we may not be able to grow our existing businesses for example 

 failure to implement our strategic objectives may have a material adverse effect on vf’s business 

vf relies significantly on information technology any inadequacy interruption integration failure or security failure of this technology could harm vf’s ability to effectively operate its business 

our ability to effectively manage and operate our business depends significantly on information technology systems we rely heavily on information technology to track sales and inventory and manage our supply chain we are also dependent on information technology including the internet for our directtoconsumer sales including our ecommerce operations and retail business credit card transaction authorization despite our preventative efforts our systems and those of our thirdparty service providers may be vulnerable to damage failure or interruption due to viruses data security incidents technical malfunctions natural disasters or other causes or in connection with upgrades to our system or the implementation of new systems the failure of these systems to operate effectively problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems difficulty in integrating new systems or systems of acquired businesses or a breach in security of these systems could adversely impact the operations of vf’s business including our reputation management of inventory ordering and replenishment of products manufacturing and distribution of products ecommerce operations retail business credit card transaction authorization and processing corporate email communications and our interaction with the public on social media 

 

vf is subject to data security and privacy risks that could negatively affect its business operations results of operations or reputation 

in the normal course of business we often collect retain and transmit certain sensitive and confidential customer information including credit card information over public networks there is a significant concern by consumers and employees over the security of personal information transmitted over the internet identity theft and user privacy data security breaches are increasingly sophisticated and are difficult to detect for long periods of time accordingly if unauthorized parties gain access to our networks or databases or those of our thirdparty service providers they may be able to steal publish delete or modify our private and sensitive information including credit card information and personal information we have implemented systems and processes designed to protect against unauthorized access to or use of personal information and rely on encryption and authentication technology to effectively secure transmission of confidential customer information including credit card information despite these security measures there is no guarantee that they are adequate and our facilities and systems and those of our thirdparty service providers may be vulnerable and unable to anticipate or detect security breaches and data loss in addition employees may intentionally or inadvertently cause data security breaches that result in the unauthorized release of personal or confidential information vf and its customers could suffer harm if valuable business data or employee customer and other proprietary information were corrupted lost or accessed or misappropriated by third parties due to a security failure in vf’s systems or one of our thirdparty service providers it could require significant expenditures to remediate any such failure or breach severely damage our reputation and our relationships with customers result in unwanted media attention and lost sales and expose us to risks of litigation and liability in addition as a result of recent security breaches at a number of prominent retailers the media and public scrutiny of information security and privacy has become more intense and the regulatory environment has become increasingly uncertain rigorous and complex as a result we may incur significant costs to comply with laws regarding the protection and unauthorized disclosure of personal information and we may not be able to comply with new regulations such as the general data protection regulation in the european union and the california consumer privacy act any failure to comply with the laws and regulations surrounding the protection of personal information could subject us to legal and reputational risk including significant fines andor litigation for noncompliance any of which could have a negative impact on revenues and profits in addition our existing insurance policies may not reimburse us for all of the damages that we might incur as a result of a security breach 

vf’s business is exposed to the risks of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations vf’s hedging strategies may not be effective in mitigating those risks 

a growing percentage of vf’s total revenues approximately 47 in fiscal 2020  is derived from markets outside the us vf’s international businesses operate in functional currencies other than the us dollar changes in currency exchange rates affect the us dollar value of the foreign currencydenominated amounts at which vf’s international businesses purchase products incur costs or sell products in addition for vf’s usbased businesses the majority of products are sourced from independent contractors or vf plants located in foreign countries as a result the costs of these products are affected by changes in the value of the relevant currencies furthermore much of vf’s licensing revenue is derived 

10 vf corporation fiscal 2020 form 10k 

from sales in foreign currencies changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse impact on vf’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in accordance with our operating practices we hedge a significant portion of our foreign currency transaction exposures arising in the ordinary course of business to reduce risks in our cash flows and earnings our hedging strategy may not be effective in reducing all risks and no hedging strategy can completely insulate vf from foreign exchange risk 

further our use of derivative financial instruments may expose vf to counterparty risks although vf only enters into hedging contracts with counterparties having investment grade credit ratings it is possible that the credit quality of a counterparty could be downgraded or a counterparty could default on its obligations which could have a material adverse impact on vf’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

there are risks associated with vf’s acquisitions 

any acquisitions or mergers by vf will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of companies these risks include among other things higher than anticipated acquisition costs and expenses the difficulty and expense of integrating the operations systems and personnel of the companies and the loss of key employees and customers as a result of changes in management in addition geographic distances may make integration of acquired businesses more difficult we may not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with any acquisitions 

our acquisitions may cause large onetime expenses or create goodwill or other intangible assets that could result in significant impairment charges in the future we also make certain estimates and assumptions in order to determine purchase price allocation and estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed if our estimates or assumptions used to value these assets and liabilities are not accurate we may be exposed to losses that may be material 

vf’s operations and earnings may be affected by legal regulatory political and economic risks 

our ability to maintain the current level of operations in our existing markets and to capitalize on growth in existing and new markets is subject to legal regulatory political and economic risks these include the burdens of complying with us and international laws and regulations and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements 

changes in regulatory geopolitical policies and other factors may adversely affect vf’s business or may require us to modify our current business practices while enactment of any such change is not certain if such changes were adopted our costs could increase which would reduce our earnings 

changes to us or international trade policy tariff and importexport regulations or our failure to comply with such regulations may have a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition and results of operations 

changes in us or international social political regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade manufacturing development and investment in the territories or countries where we currently sell our products or conduct our business as well as any negative sentiment toward 

 

the us as a result of such changes could adversely affect our business the us government has instituted or proposed changes in trade policies that include the negotiation or termination of trade agreements the imposition of higher tariffs on imports into the us economic sanctions on individuals corporations or countries and other government regulations affecting trade between the us and other countries where we conduct our business it may be timeconsuming and expensive for us to alter our business operations in order to adapt to or comply with any such changes 

as a result of recent policy changes of the us government and recent us government proposals there may be greater restrictions and economic disincentives on international trade the new tariffs and other changes in us trade policy has in the past and could continue to trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries and certain foreign governments have instituted or are considering imposing retaliatory measures on certain us goods vf similar to many other multinational corporations does a significant amount of business that would be impacted by changes to the trade policies of the us and foreign countries including governmental action related to tariffs international trade agreements or economic sanctions such changes have the potential to adversely impact the us economy or certain sectors thereof our industry and the global demand for our products and as a result could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the united kingdom’s impending departure from the european union could harm our business and financial results 

the united kingdom held a referendum on june 23 2016 in which a majority of voters voted to exit the european union “brexit” and on march 29 2017 the united kingdom submitted a formal notification of its intention to withdraw from the european union pursuant to article 50 of the treaty of lisbon on january 31 2020 the united kingdom ceased to be a member state of the european union european union law applicable to the united kingdom continues to apply to and in the united kingdom for the duration of a transition period which is presently scheduled to expire on december 31 2020 the “transition period” during the transition period the european union and the united kingdom will negotiate the terms of their future relationship there can be no assurances that such negotiations will be successful or certainty that european union law will continue to apply in and to the united kingdom following the expiration of the transition period until expiration of the transition period and the future relationship between the european union and the united kingdom is established it is difficult to anticipate brexit’s potential impact 

the effects of brexit will depend on any agreements the united kingdom makes to retain access to european union markets beyond the transition period brexit could adversely affect european and worldwide economic and market conditions and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets in addition brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the united kingdom determines which european union laws to replace or replicate any of these effects of brexit and others we cannot anticipate could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

vf corporation fiscal 2020 form 10k 11 

changes in tax laws could increase our worldwide tax rate and tax liabilities and materially affect our financial position and results of operations 

we are subject to taxation in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act “us tax act” which included a broad range of tax reform proposals affecting businesses including a reduction in the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 a onetime mandatory deemed repatriation tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously taxdeferred and a new minimum tax on certain foreign earnings taxes related to the onetime mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings due over a period of time could be accelerated upon certain triggering events including failure to pay such taxes when due in addition regulatory administrative and legislative guidance related to the us tax act continues to be released to the extent any future guidance differs from our interpretation of the law it could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 

the swiss government enacted the federal act on tax reform and ahv financing “swiss tax act” which became effective on january 1 2020 the swiss tax act was enacted to ensure that switzerland stays in conformity with the european union “eu” as well as organisation for economic cooperation and development “oecd” standards on international taxation the impact of the swiss tax act has been reported based on the official initial guidelines provided by the swiss federal and cantonal authorities future guidance that differs from our preliminary interpretation or any negative reaction from the eu member states to the swiss tax act could have material effect on our financial position and results of operations the eu has also developed a list of noncooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes referred to as the “blacklist” we continuously monitor the blacklist to determine any potential impact to vf 

in addition many countries in the eu and around the globe have adopted andor proposed changes to current tax laws further organizations such as the oecd have published action plans that if adopted by countries where we do business could increase our tax obligations in these countries more specifically the oecd has proposed an approach to address tax challenges arising from the digitalization of the economy the ultimate outcome of these proposals and the agreed upon solution that is enacted into law in each country may result in a material financial impact to vf 

due to the large scale of our us and international business activities many of these enacted and proposed changes to the taxation of our activities could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations 

we may have additional tax liabilities from new or evolving government or judicial interpretation of existing tax laws 

as a global company we determine our income tax liability in various tax jurisdictions based on an analysis and interpretation of us and local tax laws and regulations this analysis requires a significant amount of judgment and estimation and is often based on various assumptions about the future actions of the tax authorities these determinations are the subject of periodic us and international tax audits and court proceedings in particular tax authorities and the courts have increased their focus on income earned in no or lowtax jurisdictions or income that is not taxed in any jurisdiction tax authorities have also become skeptical of 

 

special tax rulings provided to companies offering lower taxes than may be applicable in other countries 

for example vf was granted a ruling which lowered the effective income tax rate on taxable earnings for years 2010 through 2014 under belgium’s excess profit tax regime in february 2015 the eu opened a state aid investigation into belgium’s rulings on january 11 2016 the eu announced its decision that these rulings were illegal and ordered that tax benefits granted under these rulings should be collected from the affected companies including vf 

on march 22 2016 the belgium government filed an appeal seeking annulment of the eu decision additionally on june 21 2016 vf europe bvba filed its own application for annulment of the eu decision 

on february 14 2019 the general court annulled the eu decision and on april 26 2019 the eu appealed the general courts annulment both listed requests for annulment remain open and unresolved additionally the eu has initiated proceedings related to individual rulings granted by belgium including the ruling granted to vf 

also vf petitioned the us tax court to resolve an internal revenue service irs dispute regarding the timing of income inclusion associated with the 2011 timberland acquisition vf remains confident in our timing and treatment of the income inclusion and therefore this matter is not reflected in our financial statements we are vigorously defending our position and do not expect the resolution to have a material adverse impact on vfs financial position results of operations or cash flows while the irs argues immediate income inclusion vfs position is to include the income over a period of years as the matter relates to 2011 nearly half of the timing in dispute has passed vf including the income and paying the related tax on our income tax returns vf notes that should the irs prevail in this timing matter the net interest expense would be up to 158 million  further this timing matter is impacted by the us tax act that reduced the us corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 if the irs is successful this rate differential would increase tax expense by approximately 136 million  

although we accrue for uncertain tax positions our accrual may be insufficient to satisfy unfavorable findings unfavorable audit findings or court interpretations involving vf or other companies with similar tax profiles may result in payment of taxes fines and penalties for prior periods and higher tax rates in future periods which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

vf’s balance sheet includes a significant amount of intangible assets and goodwill a decline in the fair value of an intangible asset or of a business unit could result in an asset impairment charge which would be recorded as an operating expense in vf’s consolidated statement of income and could be material 

vf’s policy is to evaluate indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill for possible impairment as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of such assets may be below their carrying amount in addition intangible assets that are being amortized are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable for these impairment tests we use various valuation methods to estimate the fair value of our business units and 

12 vf corporation fiscal 2020 form 10k 

intangible assets if the fair value of an asset is less than its carrying value we would recognize an impairment charge for the difference 

it is possible that we could have an impairment charge for goodwill or trademark and trade name intangible assets in future periods if i overall economic conditions in fiscal 2021 or future years vary from our current assumptions ii business conditions or our strategies for a specific business unit change from our current assumptions iii investors require higher rates of return on equity investments in the marketplace or iv enterprise values of comparable publicly traded companies or of actual sales transactions of comparable companies were to decline resulting in lower comparable multiples of revenues and earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and accordingly lower implied values of goodwill and intangible assets a future impairment charge for goodwill or intangible assets could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

vf uses thirdparty suppliers and manufacturing facilities worldwide for a substantial portion of its raw materials and finished products which poses risks to vf’s business operations 

during fiscal 2020  approximately 94 of vf’s units were purchased from independent manufacturers primarily located in asia with substantially all of the remainder produced by vfowned and operated manufacturing facilities located in mexico honduras and the dominican republic any of the following could impact our ability to produce or deliver vf products or our cost of producing or delivering products and as a result our profitability 



 

 although no single supplier and no one country is critical to vf’s production needs if we were to lose a supplier it could result in interruption of finished goods shipments to vf cancellation of orders by customers and termination of relationships this along with the damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on vf’s revenues and consequently our results of operations 

in addition although we audit our thirdparty material suppliers and contracted manufacturing facilities and set strict compliance standards actions by a thirdparty supplier or manufacturer that fail to comply could expose vf to claims for damages financial penalties and reputational harm any of which could have a material adverse effect in our business and operations 

our business is subject to national state and local laws and regulations for environmental consumer protection corporate governance competition employment privacy safety and other matters the costs of compliance with or the violation of such laws and regulations by vf or by independent suppliers who manufacture products for vf could have an adverse effect on our operations and cash flows as well as on our reputation 

our business is subject to comprehensive national state and local laws and regulations on a wide range of environmental consumer protection employment privacy safety and other matters vf could be adversely affected by costs of compliance with or violations of those laws and regulations in addition while we do not control their business practices we require thirdparty suppliers to operate in compliance with applicable laws rules and regulations regarding working conditions safety employment practices and environmental compliance the costs of products purchased by vf from independent contractors could increase due to the costs of compliance by those contractors 

failure by vf or its thirdparty suppliers to comply with such laws and regulations as well as with ethical social product labor and environmental standards or related political considerations could result in interruption of finished goods shipments to vf cancellation of orders by customers and termination of relationships if one of our independent contractors violates labor or other laws implements labor or other business practices or takes other actions that are generally regarded as unethical it could jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions including boycotts that may reduce demand for vf’s merchandise damage to vf’s reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on vf’s results of operations financial condition and cash flows as well as require additional resources to rebuild vf’s reputation 

our international operations are also subject to compliance with the us foreign corrupt practices act the “fcpa” and other antibribery laws applicable to our operations although we have policies and procedures to address compliance with the fcpa and similar laws there can be no assurance that all of our employees agents and other partners will not take actions in violation of our policies any such violation could subject us to sanctions or other penalties that could negatively affect our reputation business and operating results 

vf corporation fiscal 2020 form 10k 13 

fluctuations in wage rates and the price availability and quality of raw materials and finished goods could increase costs 

fluctuations in the price availability and quality of fabrics leather or other raw materials used by vf in its manufactured products or of purchased finished goods could have a material adverse effect on vf’s cost of goods sold or its ability to meet its customers’ demands the prices we pay depend on demand and market prices for the raw materials used to produce them the price and availability of such raw materials may fluctuate significantly depending on many factors including general economic conditions and demand crop yields energy prices weather patterns public health issues such as the current covid19 pandemic and speculation in the commodities markets prices of purchased finished products also depend on wage rates in asia and other geographic areas where our independent contractors are located as well as freight costs from those regions inflation can also have a longterm impact on us because increasing costs of materials and labor may impact our ability to maintain satisfactory margins for example the cost of the materials that are used in our manufacturing process such as oilrelated commodity prices and other raw materials such as cotton dyes and chemical and other costs such as fuel energy and utility costs can fluctuate as a result of inflation and other factors similarly a significant portion of our products are manufactured in other countries and declines in the values of the us dollar may result in higher manufacturing costs in addition fluctuations in wage rates required by legal or industry standards could increase our costs in the future vf may not be able to offset cost increases with other cost reductions or efficiencies or to pass higher costs on to its customers this could have a material adverse effect on vf’s results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

we may be adversely affected by weather conditions 

our business is adversely affected by unseasonable weather conditions a significant portion of the sales of our products is dependent in part on the weather and is likely to decline in years in which weather conditions do not favor the use of these products for example periods of unseasonably warm weather in the fall or winter can lead to reduced consumer spending that negatively impacts vfs directtoconsumer business and inventory accumulation by our wholesale customers which can in turn negatively affect orders in future seasons in addition abnormally harsh or inclement weather can also negatively impact retail traffic and consumer spending any and all of these risks may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

climate change and increased focus by governmental and nongovernmental organizations customers consumers and investors on sustainability issues including those related to climate change may adversely affect our business and financial results and damage our reputation 

climate change is occurring around the world and may impact our business in numerous ways such change could lead to an increase in raw material and packaging prices reduced availability for example due to water shortages which could adversely impact raw material availability increased frequency of extreme weather storms and floods could cause increased incidence of disruption to the production and distribution of our products and an adverse impact on consumer demand and spending 

 

a substantial portion of vf’s revenues and gross profit is derived from a small number of large customers the loss of any of these customers or the inability of any of these customers to pay vf could substantially reduce vf’s revenues and profits 

a few of vf’s customers account for a significant portion of revenues sales to vf’s ten largest customers were 17 of total revenues in fiscal 2020  with our largest customer accounting for 3 of revenues sales to our customers are generally on a purchase order basis and not subject to longterm agreements a decision by any of vf’s major customers to significantly decrease the volume of products purchased from vf could substantially reduce revenues and have a material adverse effect on vf’s financial condition and results of operations 

the retail industry has experienced financial difficulty that could adversely affect vfs business 

recently there have been consolidations reorganizations restructurings bankruptcies and ownership changes in the retail industry in addition the covid19 pandemic has resulted in closed stores and reduced consumer traffic and purchasing as governments impose mandatory business closures and similar measures to curtail the spread of the disease and consumers limit shopping due to illness or to avoid exposure these events individually and together could have and in the case of the covid19 pandemic have had a material adverse effect on vfs business these changes could impact vf’s opportunities in the market and increase vf’s reliance on a smaller number of large customers in the future retailers are likely to further consolidate undergo restructurings or reorganizations or bankruptcies realign their affiliations or reposition their stores’ target markets in addition consumers have continued to transition away from traditional wholesale retailers to large online retailers these developments could result in a reduction in the number of stores that carry vf’s products an increase in ownership concentration within the retail industry an increase in credit exposure to vf or an increase in leverage by vf’s customers over their suppliers 

further the global economy periodically experiences recessionary conditions with rising unemployment reduced availability of credit increased savings rates and declines in real estate and securities values these recessionary conditions including as a result of the current covid19 pandemic could have a negative impact on retail sales of apparel and other consumer products the lower sales volumes along with the possibility of restrictions on access to the credit markets could result in our customers experiencing financial difficulties including store closures bankruptcies or liquidations this could result in higher credit risk to vf relating to receivables from our customers who are experiencing these financial difficulties if these developments occur our inability to shift sales to other customers or to collect on vf’s trade accounts receivable could have a material adverse effect on vf’s financial condition and results of operations 

our ability to obtain shortterm or longterm financing on favorable terms if needed could be adversely affected by geopolitical risk and volatility in the capital markets 

any disruption in the capital markets could limit the availability of funds or the ability or willingness of financial institutions to extend capital in the future future volatility in the financial and credit markets including the recent volatility due in part to the current covid19 pandemic could make it more difficult for us to obtain financing or refinance existing debt when the need arises including upon maturity or on terms that would be acceptable to us this 

14 vf corporation fiscal 2020 form 10k 

disruption or volatility could adversely affect our liquidity and funding resources or significantly increase our cost of capital an inability to access capital and credit markets may have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

in addition the uk financial conduct authority announced in 2017 that it intends to phase out libor by the end of 2021 uncertainty regarding rates may make borrowing or refinancing our indebtedness more expensive or difficult to achieve on terms we consider favorable 

vf has a global revolving credit facility one or more of the participating banks may not be able to honor their commitments which could have an adverse effect on vf’s business 

vf has a 225 billion global revolving credit facility that expires in december 2023 if the financial markets return to recessionary conditions the ability of one or more of the banks participating in our credit agreements could be impaired in honoring their commitments this could have an adverse effect on our business if we were not able to replace those commitments or to locate other sources of liquidity on acceptable terms 

vf’s indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on its business financial condition and results of operations and prevent vf from fulfilling its financial obligations and vf may not be able to maintain its current credit ratings may not continue to pay dividends or repurchase its common stock and may not remain in compliance with existing debt covenants 

as of march 28 2020 vf had approximately 38 billion of debt outstanding following the end of the fiscal year vf issued 30 billion of senior notes in a transaction that closed on april 23 2020 and vf used some of the net proceeds from that offering to repay its borrowings under its revolving credit facility vf’s debt and interest payment requirements could have important consequences on its business financial condition and results of operations for example it could 

 

in addition vf may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future to fund acquisitions repurchase common stock or fund other activities for general business purposes if vf incurs additional indebtedness it may limit vf’s ability to access the debt capital markets or other forms of financing in the future and may result in increased borrowing costs 

although vf has historically declared and paid quarterly cash dividends on its common stock and has been authorized to repurchase its stock subject to certain limitations under its share repurchase programs any determinations by the board of directors 

 

to continue to declare and pay cash dividends on vf’s common stock or to repurchase vf’s common stock will be based primarily upon vf’s financial condition results of operations and business requirements its access to debt capital markets or other forms of financing the price of its common stock in the case of the repurchase program and the board of directors’ continuing determination that the repurchase programs and the declaration and payment of dividends are in the best interests of vf’s stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the repurchase and dividend programs in the event vf does not declare and pay a quarterly dividend or discontinues its share repurchases vf’s stock price could be adversely affected 

vf is required to comply with certain financial and other restrictive debt covenants in its debt documents failure by vf to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default that if not cured or waived could have a material adverse effect on the company if the lenders declare any outstanding obligations to be immediately due and payable 

the loss of members of vf’s executive management and other key employees could have a material adverse effect on its business 

vf depends on the services and management experience of its executive officers and business leaders who have substantial experience and expertise in vf’s business the unexpected loss of services of one or more of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on vf our future success also depends on our ability to recruit retain and engage our personnel sufficiently competition for experienced and wellqualified personnel is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 

vf’s directtoconsumer business includes risks that could have an adverse effect on its results of operations 

vf sells merchandise directtoconsumer through vfoperated stores and ecommerce sites its directtoconsumer business is subject to numerous risks that could have a material adverse effect on its results risks include but are not limited to i us or international resellers purchasing merchandise and reselling it overseas outside vf’s control ii failure of the systems that operate the stores and websites and their related support systems including computer viruses theft of customer information privacy concerns telecommunication failures and electronic breakins and similar disruptions iii credit card fraud and iv risks related to vf’s directtoconsumer distribution centers and processes risks specific to vf’s ecommerce business also include i diversion of sales from vf stores or wholesale customers ii difficulty in recreating the instore experience through direct channels iii liability for online content iv changing patterns of consumer behavior and v intense competition from online retailers vf’s failure to successfully respond to these risks might adversely affect sales in its ecommerce business as well as damage its reputation and brands 

our vfoperated stores and ecommerce business require substantial fixed investments in equipment and leasehold improvements information systems inventory and personnel we have entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space due to the high fixedcost structure associated with our directtoconsumer operations a decline in sales or the closure of or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs writeoffs of equipment and leasehold improvements and employeerelated costs 

vf corporation fiscal 2020 form 10k 15 

vf’s net sales depend on the volume of traffic to its stores and the availability of suitable lease space 

a growing portion of our revenues are directtoconsumer sales through vfoperated stores in order to generate customer traffic we locate many of our stores in prominent locations within successful retail shopping centers or in fashionable shopping districts our stores benefit from the ability of the retail center and other attractions in an area to generate consumer traffic in the vicinity of our stores part of our future growth is significantly dependent on our ability to operate stores in desirable locations with capital investment and lease costs providing the opportunity to earn a reasonable return we cannot control the development of new shopping centers or districts the availability or cost of appropriate locations within existing or new shopping centers or districts competition with other retailers for prominent locations or the success of individual shopping centers or districts further if we are unable to renew or replace our existing store leases or enter into leases for new stores on favorable terms or if we violate the terms of our current leases our growth and profitability could be harmed all of these factors may impact our ability to meet our growth targets and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

vf may be unable to protect its trademarks and other intellectual property rights 

vf’s trademarks and other intellectual property rights are important to its success and its competitive position vf is susceptible to others copying its products and infringing its intellectual property rights especially with the shift in product mix to higher priced brands and innovative new products in recent years some of vf’s brands such as the north face ®  timberland ®  vans ®  jansport ® and dickies ®  enjoy significant worldwide consumer recognition and the higher pricing of those products creates additional risk of counterfeiting and infringement 

vf’s trademarks trade names patents trade secrets and other intellectual property are important to vf’s success counterfeiting of vf’s products or infringement on its intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our brands and adversely affect vf’s revenues actions we have taken to establish and protect vf’s intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent copying of its products by others or to prevent others from seeking to invalidate its trademarks or block sales of vf’s products as a violation of the trademarks and intellectual property rights of others in addition unilateral actions in the us or other countries including changes to or the repeal of laws recognizing trademark or other intellectual property rights could have an impact on vf’s ability to enforce those rights 

the value of vf’s intellectual property could diminish if others assert rights in or ownership of trademarks and other intellectual property rights of vf or trademarks that are similar to vf’s trademarks or trademarks that vf licenses from others we may be unable to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction in some cases there may be trademark owners who have prior rights to vf’s trademarks because the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the us in other cases there may be holders who have prior rights to similar trademarks 

there have been and there may in the future be opposition and cancellation proceedings from time to time with respect to some of vfs intellectual property rights in some cases litigation may be necessary to protect or enforce our trademarks and other 

 

intellectual property rights furthermore third parties may assert intellectual property claims against us and we may be subject to liability required to enter into costly license agreements if available at all required to rebrand our products andor prevented from selling some of our products if third parties successfully oppose or challenge our trademarks or successfully claim that we infringe misappropriate or otherwise violate their trademarks copyrights patents or other intellectual property rights bringing or defending any such claim regardless of merit and whether successful or unsuccessful could be expensive and timeconsuming and have a negative effect on vfs business reputation results of operations and financial condition 

vf is subject to the risk that its licensees may not generate expected sales or maintain the value of vf’s brands 

during fiscal 2020  574 million of vf’s revenues were derived from licensing royalties although vf generally has significant control over its licensees’ products and advertising we rely on our licensees for among other things operational and financial controls over their businesses failure of our licensees to successfully market licensed products or our inability to replace existing licensees if necessary could adversely affect vf’s revenues both directly from reduced royalties received and indirectly from reduced sales of our other products risks are also associated with a licensee’s ability to 

 in addition vf relies on its licensees to help preserve the value of its brands although we attempt to protect vf’s brands through approval rights over design production processes quality packaging merchandising distribution advertising and promotion of our licensed products we cannot completely control the use of licensed vf brands by our licensees the misuse of a brand by a licensee including through the marketing of products under one of our brand names that do not meet our quality standards could have a material adverse effect on that brand and on vf 

if vf encounters problems with its distribution system vf’s ability to deliver its products to the market could be adversely affected 

vf relies on owned or independentlyoperated distribution facilities to warehouse and ship product to its customers vf’s distribution system includes computercontrolled and automated equipment which may be subject to a number of risks related to security or computer viruses the proper operation of software and hardware power interruptions or other system failures because substantially all of vf’s products are distributed from a relatively small number of locations vf’s operations could also be interrupted by earthquakes floods fires or other natural disasters or other events outside vfs control affecting its distribution centers we maintain business interruption insurance under our property and cyber insurance policies but it may not adequately protect vf from the adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in vf’s distribution facilities in addition vf’s distribution capacity is dependent on the timely performance of services by third parties including the transportation of product to and from its distribution facilities if we encounter problems with 

16 vf corporation fiscal 2020 form 10k 

our distribution system our ability to meet customer expectations manage inventory complete sales and achieve operating efficiencies could be materially adversely affected 

volatility in securities markets interest rates and other economic factors could substantially increase vf’s defined benefit pension costs 

vf currently has obligations under its defined benefit pension plans the funded status of the pension plans is dependent on many factors including returns on investment assets and the discount rate used to determine pension obligations unfavorable impacts from returns on plan assets decreases in discount rates changes in plan demographics or revisions in the applicable laws or regulations could materially change the timing and amount of pension funding requirements which could reduce cash available for vf’s business 

vf’s operating performance also may be negatively impacted by the amount of expense recorded for its pension plans pension expense is calculated using actuarial valuations that incorporate assumptions and estimates about financial market economic and demographic conditions differences between estimated and actual results give rise to gains and losses that are deferred and amortized as part of future pension expense which can create volatility that adversely impacts vf’s future operating results 

we may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits we expect to achieve from the spinoff 

on may 22 2019 we completed the spinoff of our jeans business kontoor brands inc kontoor brands although we believe that the spinoff will enhance our longterm value we may not be able to achieve some or all of the anticipated benefits from the separation of our businesses and the spinoff may adversely affect our business separating the businesses resulted in two independent publicly traded companies each of which is now a smaller less diversified and more narrowly focused business than before the spinoff which makes us more vulnerable to changing market and economic conditions additionally a potential loss of synergies from separating the businesses could negatively impact the balance sheet profit margins or earnings of both businesses and the combined value of the common stock of the two publicly traded companies may not be equal to or greater than the value of vf common stock had the spinoff not occurred if we fail to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve as a result of the spinoff or do not achieve them in the time we expect our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

the kontoor brands spinoff could result in substantial tax liability to us and our stockholders 

we received opinions of tax advisors substantially to the effect that for us federal income tax purposes the spinoff and certain 

 

related transactions qualify for taxfree treatment under certain sections of the internal revenue code however if the factual assumptions or representations made by us in connection with the delivery of the opinions are inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect including those relating to the past and future conduct of our business we will not be able to rely on the opinions furthermore the opinions are not binding on the irs or the courts if notwithstanding receipt of the opinions the spinoff transaction and certain related transactions are determined to be taxable we would be subject to a substantial tax liability in addition if the spinoff transaction is taxable each holder of our common stock who received shares of kontoor brands in connection with the spinoff would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares received 

even if the spinoff otherwise qualifies as a taxfree transaction the distribution would be taxable to us but not to our stockholders in certain circumstances if future significant acquisitions of our stock or the stock of kontoor brands are deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that included the spinoff in this event the resulting tax liability could be substantial in connection with the spinoff we entered into a tax matters agreement with kontoor brands pursuant to which kontoor brands agreed to not enter into any transaction that could cause any portion of the spinoff to be taxable to us without our consent and to indemnify us for any tax liability resulting from any such transaction in addition these potential tax liabilities may discourage delay or prevent a change of control of us 

certain directors who serve on our board of directors also serve as directors of kontoor brands and ownership of shares of common stock of kontoor brands following the spinoff by our directors and executive officers may create or appear to create conflicts of interest 

certain of our directors who serve on our board of directors currently serve on the board of directors of kontoor brands this may create or appear to create conflicts of interest when our or kontoor brands management and directors face decisions that could have different implications for us and kontoor brands including the resolution of any dispute regarding the terms of the agreements governing the spinoff and the relationship between us and kontoor brands after the spinoff or any other commercial agreements entered into in the future between us and kontoor brands 

some of our executive officers and nonemployee directors currently own shares of the common stock of kontoor brands the continued ownership of such common stock by our directors and executive officers following the spinoff creates or may create the appearance of a conflict of interest when these directors and executive officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for us and kontoor brands

in march 2020 the world health organization declared the outbreak of a novel coronavirus covid19 a pandemic as the global spread of covid19 continues vf remains first and foremost focused on a peoplefirst approach that prioritizes the health and wellbeing of its employees customers trade partners and consumers around the world to help mitigate the spread of covid19 vf has modified its business practices including in response to legislation executive orders and guidance from government entities and healthcare authorities collectively covid19 directives these directives include the temporary closing of offices and retail stores instituting travel bans and restrictions and implementing health and safety measures including social distancing and quarantines 

as a result of covid19 directives retail stores in asiapacific europe and the americas whether operated by vf or our customers were or are now closed currently the majority of vfoperated retail stores have reopened in asiapacific including all in mainland china and while store traffic has improved recently it remains down significantly when compared with the prior year vf has started a phased reopening of its retail stores in europe and north america in accordance with guidance from government entities and healthcare authorities to allow proper training and preparation of the retail environment vf currently expects most of its retail stores to be open by midcalendar year 2020 while many of vfs wholesale customers in north america and europe remain closed most have announced reopening plans starting in the coming weeks 

consistent with vf’s longterm strategy the company’s digital platform remains a high priority through which its brands stay 

 

connected with consumer communities while providing experiential content in accordance with local government guidelines and in consultation with the guidance of global health professionals vf has implemented measures designed to ensure the health safety and wellbeing of associates employed in its distribution and fulfillment centers around the world many of these facilities remain operational and support digital consumer engagement with its brands and to service retail partners as needed 

covid19 has also impacted some of vfs suppliers including thirdparty manufacturers logistics providers and other vendors at this time many of vfs facilities continue to manufacture and distribute products globally in a reduced capacity vf is actively monitoring our supply chain and implementing mitigation plans 

the covid19 pandemic is ongoing and dynamic in nature and continues to drive global uncertainty and disruption as a result covid19 is having a significant negative impact on the companys business including the consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 while we are not able to determine the ultimate length and severity of the covid19 pandemic we expect store closures both vfoperated and our customers an anticipated reduction in traffic once stores initially reopen and a highly promotional marketplace will have a significant negative impact on our fiscal 2021 financial performance including a decrease in revenues of approximately 50 in the first quarter 



vf has taken a number of proactive actions to advance its enterprise protection strategy in response to the covid19 outbreak 

to enhance vfs financial flexibility and liquidity in the current unprecedented period of uncertainty including the unknown duration and overall impact of the covid19 outbreak on march 23 2020 vf elected to draw down 10 billion available from its 225 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility the global credit facility that expires in december 2023 on april 9 2020 vf elected to draw down an additional 10 billion available from the global credit facility 

on april 23 2020 vf closed its sale of senior unsecured notes including 10 billion of 2050 notes due april 2022 7500 million of 2400 notes due april 2025 5000 million of 2800 notes due april 2027 and 7500 million of 2950 notes due april 2030 the net proceeds received by the company were approximately 298 billion a portion of the net proceeds was used to repay the 20 billion of borrowings under the global credit facility noted above 

 

and the remaining net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes following the notes issuance and repayment vf has approximately 22 billion available for borrowing against the global credit facility and approximately 30 billion of cash and equivalents on hand 

other actions vf has taken to support its business in response to the covid19 pandemic include the companys decision to temporarily pause its share repurchase program the company currently has 28 billion remaining under its current share repurchase authorization subject to approval by its board of directors vf intends to continue to pay its regularly scheduled dividend and is currently not contemplating the suspension of its dividend program vfs planned divestiture of the occupational workwear business would provide an additional source of cash 

other actions taken by vf also include the temporary reduction of ceo steve rendles base salary by 50 percent and the base salaries of vfs executive leadership team by 25 percent in addition vf’s board of directors will temporarily forgo their cash retainer these 

24 vf corporation fiscal 2020 form 10k 

reductions will continue to be assessed as the situation progresses 

vf has implemented cost controls to reduce discretionary spending to help mitigate the loss of sales and to conserve cash while continuing to support employees vf is also assessing its forward inventory purchase commitments to ensure proper matching of supply and demand which will result in an overall reduction in future commitments as vf continues to actively monitor the situation we may take further actions that affect our operations 

 

we believe the company has sufficient liquidity and flexibility to operate during the disruptions caused by the covid19 pandemic and related governmental actions and regulations and health authority advisories and meet its obligations as they become due however due to the uncertainty of the duration and severity of the covid19 pandemic governmental actions in response to the pandemic and the impact on us and our consumers customers and suppliers there is no certainty that the measures we take will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by covid19 see item 1a risk factors for additional discussion 





 

primarily driven by a mixshift to higher margin businesses and a favorable net foreign currency transaction impact 







the following table presents a summary of the changes in net revenues for the year ended march 2020 compared to the year ended march 2019 



vf corporation fiscal 2020 form 10k 25 

year ended march 2020 compared to year ended march 2019 

vf reported a 2 increase in revenues in 2020  the revenue increase was attributable to organic growth in all segments and continued strength in our directtoconsumer and international businesses the increase was partially offset by lower revenues due to the reef ® brand and van moer business dispositions and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency the overall increase was also impacted by lower revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 primarily driven by the covid19 outbreak which resulted in an 11 decrease in revenues over the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 excluding the impact of foreign currency international sales grew in every region in 2020  

there is significant uncertainty about the duration and extent of the impact of covid19 however due to store closures and an expected reduction in initial traffic once stores reopen we anticipate there will be a significant negative impact to our fiscal 2021 revenues including a decrease of approximately 50 in the first quarter 

additional details on revenues are provided in the section titled “information by reportable segment” 

the following table presents the percentage relationship to net revenues for components of the consolidated statements of income 



year ended march 2020 compared to year ended march 2019 

gross margin increased 70 basis points to 553 in 2020 compared to 546 in 2019  gross margin in 2020 was positively impacted by a mixshift to higher margin businesses and a favorable net foreign currency transaction impact 

selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased 30 basis points in 2020 compared to 2019  this increase was primarily due to continued investments in our key strategic growth initiatives which include directtoconsumer demand creation product innovation and technology these costs were partially offset by leverage of operating expenses on higher revenues decreased compensation costs and lower transaction and dealrelated costs in 2020  

vf recorded a 3232 million noncash impairment charge related to the timberland reporting unit during the fourth quarter of 2020 for additional information refer to notes 9 and 23 to the consolidated financial statements and the critical accounting policies and estimates section below 

in 2020  operating margin decreased 280 basis points to 88 from 116 in 2019  primarily due to the items described above 

net interest expense decreased 206 million to 722 million in 2020  the decrease in net interest expense was due to lower rates on decreased borrowings of shortterm debt partially due to repayment activity funded by the cash received from kontoor brands and higher international cash balances in higher yielding currencies the decrease was partially offset by a deferred loss on an interest rate hedging contract of 85 million recognized in net interest expense in 2020 in connection with the full redemption of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding 2021 notes 

outstanding interestbearing debt averaged 26 billion and 34 billion for 2020 and 2019  respectively with shortterm borrowings representing 152 and 353 of average debt outstanding for the respective years the weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt was 30 in 2020 and 31 in 2019  

loss on debt extinguishment of 598 million was recorded in 2020 as a result of the premiums amortization and fees associated with cash tender offers for vfs outstanding 2033 and 2037 notes and the full redemption of vfs outstanding 2021 notes 

 

other income expense net primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses other components of net periodic pension cost excluding the service cost component and nonoperating gains and losses other income expense netted to 687 million and 591 million in 2020 and 2019  respectively included in other income expense net in 2020 is 483 million expense related to the release of currency translation amounts associated with the substantial liquidation of foreign entities in certain countries in south america and 274 million expense related to pension settlement charges included in other income expense net in 2019 is the loss on sale of the reef ® brand of 144 million and loss on sale of 224 million related to the divestiture of the van moer business 

the effective income tax rate was 135 in 2020 compared to 162 in 2019  the effective income tax rate is lower in 2020 when compared to 2019 primarily due to the discrete tax benefit associated with the transitional impact of the swiss tax act the 2020 effective income tax rate included a net discrete tax benefit of 925 million  which primarily related to the 936 million net tax benefit recognized due to the transitional impact from the enactment of the swiss tax act the 925 million net discrete tax benefit in 2020 reduced the effective income tax rate by 127 compared to an unfavorable 20 impact of discrete items for 2019  excluding discrete items the effective tax rate during 2020 increased by approximately 120 primarily due to nondeductible goodwill impairment charges and a lower percentage of income in lower tax rate jurisdictions the international effective tax rate was 156 for 2020  

as a result of the above income from continuing operations in 2020 was 6291 million  157 per diluted share compared to 8704 million  217 per diluted share in 2019  

there is significant uncertainty about the duration and extent of the impact of covid19 however due to expected lower revenues the adverse impact to gross margin due to higher promotional activity and higher net interest expense resulting from recent debt issuances we anticipate there will be a significant negative impact to our fiscal 2021 income from continuing operations

the following discussion refers to significant changes in balances for continuing operations at march 2020 compared to march 2019  



 

commercial paper borrowings including the use of funds provided by the cash received from kontoor brands 





the financial condition of vf is reflected in the following 



the current ratio remained flat at march 2020 compared to march 2019  as increases in current assets driven by higher cash balances primarily due to debt issuances as discussed in the cash provided used by financing activities section below and higher inventory balances as discussed in the balance sheets section above were offset by increases in current liabilities driven by higher shortterm borrowings and accrued liabilities as discussed in the balance sheets section above the comparison was negatively impacted by the recording of the current portion of operating lease liabilities in accrued liabilities in the march 2020 period in connection with the adoption of asc 842 

for the ratio of debt to total capital debt is defined as shortterm and longterm borrowings in addition to operating lease liabilities beginning in the fiscal 2020 period total capital is defined as debt plus stockholders’ equity the increase in the debt to total capital ratio at march 2020 compared to march 2019 was attributed to the increase in operating lease liabilities the increase in shortterm borrowings and the increase in longterm debt as discussed in the 

 

balance sheets section above the increase was also attributed to a decrease in stockholders equity driven by share repurchases and payments of dividends partially offset by net income and stockbased compensation activity excluding the operating lease liabilities the debt to total capital ratio was 533 as of march 2020  vfs consolidated indebtedness excluding operating lease liabilities and net of unrestricted cash of vf and its subsidiaries as a percentage of total capital net debt to capital was 424 as of march 2020 

vf’s primary source of liquidity is the strong annual cash flow from operating activities cash from operations is typically lower in the first half of the calendar year as inventory builds to support peak sales periods in the second half of the calendar year cash provided by operating activities in the second half of the calendar year is substantially higher as inventories are sold and accounts receivable are collected additionally directtoconsumer sales are typically highest in the fourth quarter of the calendar year 

vf corporation fiscal 2020 form 10k 35 

in summary our cash flows from continuing operations were as follows 



cash provided used by operating activities 

cash flow related to operating activities is dependent on net income adjustments to net income and changes in working capital the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in the year ended march 2020 compared to the year ended march 2019 is primarily due to lower net income in the year ended march 2020 and an increase in net cash usage for working capital 

cash provided by operating activities in the year ended march 2019 reflects higher net income and net cash provided by working capital 

cash used by operating activities in the three months ended march 2018 reflects net cash usage from working capital driven by the timing of payments and cash collections 

cash provided by operating activities in the year ended december 2017 reflects lower net income that was largely offset by working capital changes primarily related to an increase in accrued income tax payable resulting from the us tax act 

cash used by investing activities 

the increase in cash used by investing activities in the year ended march 2020 compared to the year ended march 2019 related primarily to 4303 million of proceeds from the sale of businesses net of cash sold in the year ended march 2019  partially offset by 3204 million of net cash paid for acquisitions in the year ended march 2019 and 637 million from the sale of office real estate and related assets in connection with the relocation of vfs global headquarters and certain brands to denver colorado in the year ended march 2020 capital expenditures increase d 724 million compared to the year ended march 2019  

vfs investing activities in the year ended march 2019 include 4303 million of proceeds from the sale of businesses net of cash sold in the year the proceeds were more than offset by 3204 million of net cash paid for acquisitions capital expenditures of 2158 million and software purchases of 532 million 

vfs investing activities in the three months ended march 2018 include 455 million of capital expenditures proceeds from the sale of property plant and equipment of 208 million and 187 million of software purchases 

vf’s investing activities in the year ended december 2017 related primarily to the williamsondickie acquisition of 7405 million  net of cash received additionally the activities included 2150 million of proceeds from the sale of lsg capital expenditures of 1402 million and software purchases of 636 million offset the proceeds received 

cash provided used by financing activities 

the increase in cash provided by financing activities in the year ended march 2020 compared to the year ended march 2019 was primarily due to a net increase in shortterm borrowings of 14 

 

billion  proceeds from longterm debt of 11 billion and 9061 million of cash received from kontoor brands net of cash transferred which was partially offset by an 8493 million increase in share repurchases and a 6428 million increase in payments on longterm debt during the year ended march 2020  

vfs financing activities in the year ended march 2019 include an 8642 million net decrease in shortterm borrowings 7671 million in cash dividends paid and 1507 million in share repurchases 

vfs financing activities in the three months ended march 2018 include a 7959 million net increase in shortterm borrowings partially offset by 2503 million in share repurchases and 1814 million in cash dividends paid 

vfs financing activities in the year ended december 2017 include 12 billion in share repurchases a 2500 million repayment of longterm debt and 6847 million in cash dividends paid partially offset by a 6865 million net increase in shortterm borrowings 

during the years ended march 2020 and 2019  the three months ended march 2018 and the year ended december 2017  vf purchased 120 million 19 million 34 million and 222 million shares respectively of its common stock in open market transactions under the share repurchase program authorized by vfs board of directors the cost was 10 billion 1507 million 2503 million and 12 billion with an average price per share of 8333 8062 7446 and 5404 in the years ended march 2020 and 2019  the three months ended march 2018 and the year ended december 2017  respectively these amounts include shares held by the companys deferred compensation plans 

in response to the covid19 outbreak and to preserve financial liquidity vf has made the decision to temporarily pause its share repurchase program as of the end of fiscal 2020  the company had 28 billion remaining for future repurchases under its share repurchase program vf will continue to evaluate its use of capital giving first priority to business acquisitions and then to direct shareholder return in the form of dividends and share repurchases 

vf relies on continued strong cash generation to finance its ongoing operations in addition vf has significant liquidity from its available cash balances and credit facilities vf maintains a 225 billion senior unsecured revolving line of credit the “global credit facility” that expires in december 2023 vf may request an unlimited number of one year extensions so long as each extension does not cause the remaining life of the global credit facility to exceed five years subject to stated terms and conditions the global credit facility may be used to borrow funds in both us dollar and certain nonus dollar currencies and has a 500 million letter of credit sublimit in addition the global credit facility supports vf’s us commercial paper program for shortterm seasonal working capital requirements and general corporate purposes including share repurchases and acquisitions outstanding shortterm balances may vary from period to period depending on the level of corporate requirements borrowings 

36 vf corporation fiscal 2020 form 10k 

under the global credit facility are priced at a credit spread of 810 basis points over the appropriate libor benchmark for each currency vf is also required to pay a facility fee to the lenders currently equal to 65 basis points of the committed amount of the facility the credit spread and facility fee are subject to adjustment based on vf’s credit ratings 

in april 2020 vf entered into an amendment to the global credit facility that resulted in certain changes to the restrictive covenants including an increase to the consolidated indebtedness to consolidated capitalization ratio financial covenant to 70 and revised calculation of consolidated indebtedness to be net of unrestricted cash of vf and its subsidiaries 

in march 2020 vf elected to draw down 10 billion from the global credit facility to strengthen the companys cash position and support general working capital needs in fiscal 2021 which was an action taken by vf in response to the covid19 pandemic on april 9 2020 vf elected to draw down an additional 10 billion available from the global credit facility 

vf has a commercial paper program that allows for borrowings up to 225 billion to the extent that it has borrowing capacity under the global credit facility commercial paper borrowings and standby letters of credit issued as of march 2020 were 2150 million and 184 million  respectively 

vf has 973 million of international lines of credit with various banks which are uncommitted and may be terminated at any time by either vf or the banks total outstanding balances under these arrangements were 138 million and 91 million at march 2020 and march 2019  respectively borrowings under these arrangements had a weighted average interest rate of 163 and 246 at march 2020 and march 2019  respectively 

in february 2020 vf issued €5000 million of 0250 eurodenominated fixedrate notes maturing in february 2028 and €5000 million of 0625 eurodenominated fixedrate notes maturing in february 2032 the 2028 notes were issued as a green bond and thus an amount equal to the net proceeds will be used to finance projects that focus on key environmental sustainability initiatives including sustainable products and materials sustainable operations and supply chain and natural carbon sinks 

in february and march 2020 vf completed cash tender offers for 230 million and 631 million in aggregate principal amounts of its outstanding 600 fixedrate notes due 2033 and 645 fixedrate notes due 2037 respectively the cash tender offers were subject to various conditions which resulted in premiums of 86 million and 319 million for the 2033 and 2037 notes respectively 

in march 2020 vf completed the full redemption of 5000 million in aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 350 fixedrate notes due 2021 the redemption price was equal to the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest discounted to the redemption date at 120 basis points  which resulted in a makewhole premium of 170 million  

on april 23 2020 vf closed its sale of senior unsecured notes including 10 billion of 2050 notes due april 2022 7500 million 

 

of 2400 notes due april 2025 5000 million of 2800 notes due april 2027 and 7500 million of 2950 notes due april 2030 the net proceeds received by the company were approximately 298 billion a portion of the net proceeds was used to repay the 20 billion of borrowings under the global credit facility noted above and the remaining net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes following the notes issuance and repayment vf has approximately 22 billion available for borrowing against the global credit facility and approximately 30 billion of cash and equivalents on hand 

vf’s favorable credit agency ratings allow for access to additional liquidity at competitive rates at the end of march 2020  vf’s longterm debt ratings were ‘a’ by standard  poor’s ratings services and ‘a3’ by moody’s investors service both with stable outlooks and commercial paper ratings by those rating agencies were ‘a1’ and ‘prime2’ respectively in april 2020 standard  poors ratings services revised vfs credit rating outlook to negative from stable to reflect the risk that extended economic stress from the covid19 pandemic on operating performance could result in a downgrade due to prolonged credit measure deterioration similarly in april 2020 moodys investor services also revised vfs credit rating outlook to negative at the same time both agencies affirmed vf’s longterm debt and commercial paper ratings 

none of vf’s longterm debt agreements contain acceleration of maturity clauses based solely on changes in credit ratings however if there were a change in control of vf and as a result of the change in control the 2023 2028 2032 and 2037 notes were rated below investment grade by recognized rating agencies vf would be obligated to repurchase the notes at 101 of the aggregate principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest 

cash dividends totaled 190 per share in the year ended march 2020 as compared to 194 046 and 172 in the year ended march 2019  the three months ended march 2018 and the year ended december 2017  respectively the dividend payout ratio was 1118 of diluted earnings per share in the year ended march 2020  as compared to 617  730 and 1129 in the year ended march 2019  the three months ended march 2018 and the year ended december 2017  respectively the company has declared a dividend of 048 per share that is payable in the first quarter of fiscal 2021  subject to approval by its board of directors vf intends to continue to pay its regularly scheduled dividend and is not contemplating the suspension of its dividend program at this time 

there is currently significant uncertainty about the duration and extent of the impact of covid19 however we expect there will be a significant negative impact to our fiscal 2021 cash flows we believe the company has sufficient liquidity and flexibility to operate during the disruptions caused by the covid19 pandemic and related governmental actions and regulations and health authority advisories and meet its obligations as they become due however due to the uncertainty of the duration and severity of the covid19 pandemic governmental actions in response to the pandemic and the impact on us and our consumers customers and suppliers there is no certainty that the measures we take will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by covid19 

vf corporation fiscal 2020 form 10k 37 

following is a summary of vf’s contractual obligations and commercial commitments at the end of march 2020 that will require the use of funds 





 

vf had other financial commitments at the end of fiscal 2020 that are not included in the above table but may require the use of funds under certain circumstances 



 

management believes that vf’s cash balances and funds provided by operating activities as well as its global credit facility additional borrowing capacity and access to capital markets taken as a whole provide i adequate liquidity to meet all of its current and longterm obligations when due ii adequate liquidity to fund capital expenditures and to maintain the planned dividend payout rate and iii flexibility to meet investment opportunities that may arise 

vf does not participate in transactions with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships established to facilitate offbalance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes 

38 vf corporation fiscal 2020 form 10k 



vf is exposed to risks in the ordinary course of business management regularly assesses and manages exposures to these risks through operating and financing activities and when appropriate by i taking advantage of natural hedges within vf ii purchasing insurance from commercial carriers or iii using derivative financial instruments some potential risks are discussed below 

insured risks 

vf is selfinsured for a significant portion of its employee medical workers’ compensation vehicle and general liability exposures vf purchases insurance from highlyrated commercial carriers to cover other risks including directors and officers property and umbrella and to establish stoploss limits on selfinsurance arrangements 

cash and equivalents risks 

vf had 14 billion of cash and equivalents at the end of fiscal 2020  management continually monitors the credit ratings of the financial institutions with whom vf conducts business similarly management monitors the credit quality of cash equivalents 

defined benefit pension plan risks 

at the end of fiscal 2020  vf’s defined benefit pension plans were underfunded by a net total of 140 million  the underfunded status includes a 1185 million liability related to our unfunded us supplemental defined benefit plan 528 million of net liabilities related to our nonus defined benefit plans and a 1574 million net asset related to our us qualified defined benefit plan vf will continue to evaluate the funded status and future funding requirements of these plans which depends in part on the future performance of the plans’ investment portfolios management believes that vf has sufficient liquidity to make any required contributions to the pension plans in future years 

vf’s reported earnings are subject to risks due to the volatility of its pension expense which has ranged in recent years from 348 million in the year ended december 2017 to 236 million in the year ended march 2020 including the 274 million settlement charge discussed below these fluctuations are primarily due to the decrease in service costs due to the freeze of future benefit accruals in the us qualified and supplemental defined benefit plans as of december 31 2018 and varying amounts of actuarial gains and losses that are deferred and amortized to future years’ expense the assumptions that impact actuarial gains and losses include the rate of return on investments held by the pension plans the discount rate used to value participant liabilities and demographic characteristics of the participants 

in fiscal 2019 vf approved a freeze of all future benefit accruals under the us qualified defined benefit pension plan and supplemental defined benefit pension plan effective december 31 2018 during the year ended march 2020 vf took an additional step in managing pension risk by offering former employees in the us qualified plan a lumpsum option to receive a distribution of their deferred vested benefits pursuant to which the plan paid approximately 130 million in distributions to settle 170 million of projected benefit obligations related to participants vf recorded a 230 million settlement charge in other income expense net line item in the consolidated statement of income during the year ended march 2020 to recognize the related deferred actuarial 

 

losses in accumulated oci the us qualified plan participants were reduced by 10 as a result of this offer no additional funding of the pension plan was required as all distributions were paid out of existing plan assets and the plan’s funded status remained materially unchanged refer to note 16 to the consolidated financial statements and the “critical accounting policies and estimates” section below 

vf has taken a series of steps to manage the risk and volatility in the pension plans and their impact on the financial statements the us qualified and supplemental defined benefit plans were closed to new entrants in 2005 and all future benefit accruals were frozen as of december 31 2018 the investment strategy of the us qualified plan continues to define dynamic asset allocation targets that are dependent upon changes in the plan’s funded status capital market expectations and risk tolerance management will continue to evaluate actions that may help to reduce vf’s risks related to its defined benefit plans 

interest rate risks 

vf limits the risk of interest rate fluctuations by managing the mix of fixed and variable interest rate debt in addition vf may use derivative financial instruments to manage risk since all of vf’s longterm debt has fixed interest rates the exposure relates to changes in interest rates on variable rate shortterm borrowings which averaged approximately 3990 million during fiscal 2020  however any change in interest rates would also affect interest income earned on vf’s cash equivalents based on the average amount of variable rate borrowings and cash equivalents during fiscal 2020  the effect of a hypothetical 1 increase in interest rates would be a decrease in reported net income of approximately 05 million  

foreign currency exchange rate risks 

vf is a global enterprise subject to the risk of foreign currency fluctuations approximately 47 of vf’s revenues in the year ended march 2020 were generated in international markets most of vf’s foreign businesses operate in functional currencies other than the us dollar in periods where the us dollar strengthens relative to the euro or other foreign currencies where vf has operations there is a negative impact on vf’s operating results upon translation of those foreign operating results into the us dollar as discussed later in this section management hedges vf’s investments in certain foreign operations and foreign currency transactions 

the reported values of assets and liabilities in these foreign businesses are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for net advances to and investments in vf’s foreign businesses that are considered to be longterm the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on those longterm advances is deferred as a component of accumulated oci in stockholders’ equity the us dollar value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries fluctuates with changes in the underlying functional currencies in february 2020 vf issued €10 billion of eurodenominated fixedrate notes and in september 2016 vf issued €850 million of eurodenominated fixedrate notes these notes have been designated as net investment hedges of vf’s investment in certain foreign operations because this debt qualified as a nonderivative hedging instrument foreign currency transaction gains or losses of the debt are deferred in the foreign currency translation and other component of accumulated oci as 

vf corporation fiscal 2020 form 10k 39 

an offset to the foreign currency translation adjustments on the hedged investments any amounts deferred in accumulated oci will remain until the hedged investment is sold or substantially liquidated 

vf monitors net foreign currency market exposures and enters into derivative foreign currency contracts to hedge the effects of exchange rate fluctuations for a significant portion of forecasted foreign currency cash flows or specific foreign currency transactions relating to crossborder inventory purchases production costs product sales operating costs and intercompany royalty payments vf’s practice is to buy or sell foreign currency exchange contracts that cover up to 80 of foreign currency exposures for periods of up to 24 months currently vf uses only foreign exchange forward contracts but may use options or collars in the future this use of financial instruments allows management to reduce the overall exposure to risks from exchange rate fluctuations on vf’s cash flows and earnings since gains and losses on these contracts will offset losses and gains on the transactions being hedged 

for cash flow hedging contracts outstanding at the end of fiscal 2020  if there were a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates compared to rates at the end of fiscal 2020  it would result in a change in fair value of those contracts of approximately 239 million  however any change in the fair value of the hedging contracts would be substantially offset by a change in the fair value of the underlying hedged exposure impacted by the currency rate changes 

counterparty risks 

vf is exposed to creditrelated losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to derivative hedging 

 

instruments to manage this risk we have established counterparty credit guidelines and only enter into derivative transactions with financial institutions that have ‘a minusa3’ investment grade credit ratings or better vf continually monitors the credit rating of and limits the amount hedged with each counterparty additionally management utilizes a portfolio of financial institutions to minimize exposure to potential counterparty defaults and adjusts positions as necessary vf also monitors counterparty risk for derivative contracts within the defined benefit pension plans 

commodity price risks 

vf is exposed to market risks for the pricing of cotton leather rubber wool and other materials which we either purchase directly or in a converted form such as fabric or shoe soles to manage risks of commodity price changes management negotiates prices in advance when possible vf has not historically managed commodity price exposures by using derivative instruments 

deferred compensation and related investment security risks 

vf has nonqualified deferred compensation plans in which liabilities to the plans’ participants are based on the market values of the participants’ selection of a hypothetical portfolio of investment funds vf invests in a portfolio of securities that substantially mirrors the participants’ investment selections the increases and decreases in deferred compensation liabilities are substantially offset by corresponding increases and decreases in the market value of vf’s investments resulting in an insignificant net exposure to operating results and financial position 



vf has chosen accounting policies that management believes are appropriate to accurately and fairly report vf’s operating results and financial position in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us vf applies these accounting policies in a consistent manner significant accounting policies are summarized in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

the application of these accounting policies requires that vf make estimates and assumptions about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses contingent assets and liabilities and related disclosures these estimates assumptions and judgments are based on historical experience current trends and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis because vf’s business cycle is relatively short ie from the date 

 

that inventory is received until that inventory is sold and the trade receivable is collected actual results related to most estimates are known within a few months after any balance sheet date in addition vf may retain outside specialists to assist in valuations of business acquisitions impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets equity compensation pension benefits and selfinsured liabilities if actual results ultimately differ from previous estimates the revisions are included in results of operations when the actual amounts become known 

vf believes the following accounting policies involve the most significant management estimates assumptions and judgments used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements or are the most sensitive to change from outside factors the application of these critical accounting policies and estimates is discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors 



vf’s inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value cost includes all material labor and overhead costs incurred to manufacture or purchase the finished goods overhead allocated to manufactured product is based on the normal capacity of plants and does not include amounts related to idle capacity or abnormal production inefficiencies vf performs a detailed review at each business unit at least quarterly of all inventories on the basis of individual styles or individual stylesizecolor stock keeping units to identify slow moving or excess products discontinued and to 

 

bediscontinued products and offquality merchandise this review matches inventory on hand plus current production and purchase commitments with current and expected future sales orders management performs an evaluation to estimate net realizable value using a systematic and consistent methodology of forecasting future demand market conditions and selling prices less costs of disposal if the estimated net realizable value is less than cost vf provides an allowance to reflect the lower value of that inventory this methodology recognizes inventory exposures 

40 vf corporation fiscal 2020 form 10k 

at the time such losses are evident rather than at the time goods are actually sold historically these estimates of future demand and selling prices have not varied significantly from actual results due to vf’s timely identification and ability to rapidly dispose of these distressed inventories 

existence of physical inventory is verified through periodic physical inventory counts and ongoing cycle counts at most locations 

 

throughout the year vf provides for estimated inventory losses that have likely occurred since the last physical inventory date historically physical inventory shrinkage has not been material 



vf allocates the purchase price of an acquired business to the fair values of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed with any excess purchase price recorded as goodwill vf evaluates fair value at acquisition using three valuation techniques  the replacement cost market and income methods  and weights the valuation methods based on what is most appropriate in the circumstances the process of assigning fair values particularly to acquired intangible assets is highly subjective 

fair value for acquired intangible assets is generally based on the present value of expected cash flows indefinitelived trademark or trade name intangible assets collectively referred to herein as “trademarks” represent individually acquired trademarks some of which are registered in multiple countries definitelived customer relationship intangible assets are based on the value of relationships with wholesale customers at the time of acquisition goodwill represents the excess of cost of an acquired business over the fair value of net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired and is assigned at the reporting unit level 

vf’s depreciation policies for property plant and equipment reflect judgments on their estimated economic lives and residual value if any vf’s amortization policies for definitelived intangible assets reflect judgments on the estimated amounts and duration of future cash flows expected to be generated by those assets in evaluating the amortizable life for customer relationship intangible assets management considers historical attrition patterns for various groups of customers 

testing of definitelived assets 

vf’s policy is to review property plant and equipment and definitelived intangible assets for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable vf tests for potential impairment at the asset or asset group level which is the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent vf measures recoverability of the carrying value of an asset or asset group by comparison to the estimated pretax undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if the forecasted pretax undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset are not expected to be adequate to recover the asset’s carrying value a fair value analysis must be performed and an impairment charge is recorded if there is an excess of the asset’s carrying value over its estimated fair value 

when testing property plant and equipment for potential impairment vf uses the incomebased discounted cash flow method using the estimated cash flows of the respective asset or asset group the estimated pretax undiscounted cash flows of the asset or asset group through the end of its useful life are compared to its carrying value if the pretax undiscounted cash flows of the asset or asset group exceed its carrying value there is no impairment charge if the pretax undiscounted cash flows of the asset or asset group are less than its carrying value the estimated 

 

fair value of the asset or asset group is calculated based on the aftertax discounted cash flows using an appropriate weighted average cost of capital wacc and an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group and its carrying value 

when testing customer relationship intangible assets for potential impairment management considers historical customer attrition rates and projected revenues and profitability related to customers that existed at acquisition management uses the multiperiod excess earnings method which is a specific application of the discounted cash flow method to value customer relationship assets the estimated pretax undiscounted cash flows of the asset through the end of its useful life are compared to its carrying value if the pretax undiscounted cash flows of the asset exceed its carrying value there is no impairment charge if the pretax undiscounted cash flows of the asset are less than its carrying value the estimated fair value of the asset is calculated based on the present value of the aftertax cash flows expected to be generated by the customer relationship asset after deducting contributory asset charges and an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value of the asset and its carrying value 

testing of indefinitelived assets and goodwill 

vf’s policy is to evaluate indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill for possible impairment as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of such assets may be below their carrying amount as part of its annual impairment testing vf may elect to assess qualitative factors as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform quantitative impairment testing if management’s assessment of these qualitative factors indicates that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset or reporting unit is less than its carrying value then no further testing is required otherwise the intangible asset or reporting unit must be quantitatively tested for impairment 

an indefinitelived intangible asset is quantitatively tested for possible impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value fair value of an indefinitelived trademark is based on an income approach using the relieffromroyalty method under this method forecasted revenues for products sold with the trademark are assigned a royalty rate that would be charged to license the trademark in lieu of ownership and the estimated fair value is calculated as the present value of those forecasted royalties avoided by owning the trademark the appropriate discount rate is based on the reporting unit’s wacc that considers market participant assumptions plus a spread that factors in the risk of the intangible asset the royalty rate is selected based on consideration of i royalty rates included in active license agreements if applicable ii royalty rates received by market participants in the apparel industry and iii the current 

vf corporation fiscal 2020 form 10k 41 

performance of the reporting unit if the estimated fair value of the trademark intangible asset exceeds its carrying value there is no impairment charge if the estimated fair value of the trademark is less than its carrying value an impairment charge would be recognized for the difference 

goodwill is quantitatively evaluated for possible impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value reporting units are businesses with discrete financial information that is available and reviewed by management 

for goodwill impairment testing vf estimates the fair value of a reporting unit using both incomebased and marketbased valuation methods the incomebased approach is based on the reporting unit’s forecasted future cash flows that are discounted to present value using the reporting unit’s wacc as discussed above for the marketbased approach management uses both the guideline company and similar transaction methods the guideline company method analyzes market multiples of revenues and earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” for a group of comparable public companies the market multiples used in the valuation are based on the relative strengths and weaknesses of the reporting unit compared to the selected guideline companies under the similar transactions method valuation multiples are calculated utilizing actual transaction prices and revenueebitda data from target companies deemed similar to the reporting unit 

based on the range of estimated fair values developed from the income and marketbased methods vf determines the estimated fair value for the reporting unit if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value the goodwill is not impaired and no further review is required however if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value vf calculates the impairment loss as the difference between the carrying value of the reporting unit and the estimated fair value 

the incomebased fair value methodology requires management’s assumptions and judgments regarding economic conditions in the markets in which vf operates and conditions in the capital markets many of which are outside of management’s control at the reporting unit level fair value estimation requires management’s assumptions and judgments regarding the effects of overall economic conditions on the specific reporting unit along with assessment of the reporting unit’s strategies and forecasts of future cash flows forecasts of individual reporting unit cash flows involve management’s estimates and assumptions regarding 



 

under the marketbased fair value methodology judgment is required in evaluating market multiples and recent transactions management believes that the assumptions used for its impairment tests are representative of those that would be used by market participants performing similar valuations of vf’s reporting units

other reporting units  qualitative impairment analysis 

for all other reporting units vf elected to perform a qualitative assessment during the annual goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment testing to determine whether it was more likely than not that the goodwill and indefinitelived trademark intangible assets in those reporting units were impaired in this qualitative assessment vf considered relevant events and circumstances for each reporting unit including i current year results ii financial performance versus management’s annual and fiveyear strategic plans iii changes in the reporting unit carrying value since prior year iv industry and market conditions in which the reporting unit operates v macroeconomic conditions including discount rate changes and vi changes in products or services offered by the reporting unit if applicable performance in recent years was compared to forecasts included in prior valuations based on the results of the qualitative assessment vf concluded that it was not more likely than not that the carrying values of the goodwill and indefinitelived trademark intangible assets were greater than their fair values and that further quantitative testing was not necessary 

management’s use of estimates and assumptions 

management made its estimates based on information available as of the date of our assessments using assumptions we believe market participants would use in performing an independent valuation of the business it is possible that vf’s conclusions regarding impairment or recoverability of goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets in any reporting unit could change in future periods there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions used in our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment testing will prove to be accurate predictions of the future if for example i the businesses do not perform as projected ii overall economic conditions in fiscal 2021 or future years vary from current assumptions including changes in discount rates iii business conditions or strategies for a specific reporting unit change from current assumptions including loss of major customers iv investors require higher rates of return on equity investments in the marketplace or v enterprise values of comparable publicly traded companies or actual sales transactions of comparable companies were to decline resulting in lower multiples of revenues and ebitda 

a future impairment charge for goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets could have a material effect on vf’s consolidated financial position and results of operations 

44 vf corporation fiscal 2020 form 10k 



vf uses a lattice optionpricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees and nonemployee members of the board of directors vf believes that a lattice model provides a refined estimate of the fair value of options because it can incorporate i historical option exercise patterns and multiple assumptions about future option exercise patterns for each of several groups of option holders and ii inputs that vary over time such as assumptions for interest rates and volatility management performs an annual review of all assumptions employed in the valuation of option grants and believes they are reflective of the outstanding options and underlying common stock and of groups of option participants the lattice valuation incorporates the assumptions listed in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements 

one of the critical assumptions in the valuation process is estimating the expected average life of the options before they are exercised for each option grant vf estimated the expected average life based on evaluations of the historical and expected 

 

option exercise patterns for each of the groups of option holders that have historically exhibited different option exercise patterns these evaluations included i voluntary stock option exercise patterns based on a combination of changes in the price of vf common stock and periods of time that options are outstanding before exercise and ii involuntary exercise patterns resulting from turnover retirement and death 

volatility is another critical assumption requiring judgment management bases its estimates of future volatility on a combination of implied and historical volatility implied volatility is based on shortterm 6 to 9 months publicly traded nearthemoney options on vf common stock vf measures historical volatility over a tenyear period corresponding to the contractual term of the options using daily stock prices management’s assumption for valuation purposes is that expected volatility starts at a level equal to the implied volatility and then transitions to the historical volatility over the remainder of the tenyear option term 



vf sponsors a qualified defined benefit pension plan covering most fulltime us employees hired before 2005 and an unfunded supplemental defined benefit pension plan us pension plans that provides benefits in excess of the limitations imposed by income tax regulations in fiscal 2019 vf approved a freeze of all future benefit accruals under the us qualified defined benefit pension plan and supplemental defined benefit pension plan effective december 31 2018 vf also sponsors certain nonus defined benefit pension plans the selection of actuarial assumptions for determining the projected pension benefit liabilities and annual pension expense is significant due to amounts involved and the long time period over which benefits are accrued and paid 

annually management reviews the principal economic actuarial assumptions summarized in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements and revises them as appropriate based on current rates and trends as of the valuation date vf also periodically reviews and revises as necessary other plan assumptions such as rates of compensation increases retirement termination disability and mortality vf believes the assumptions appropriately reflect the participants’ demographics and projected benefit obligations of the plans and result in the best estimate of the plans’ future experience actual results may vary from the actuarial assumptions used 

the below discussion of discount rate return on assets and mortality assumptions relates specifically to the us pension plans as they comprise approximately 91 of vf’s total defined benefit plan assets and approximately 88 of vf’s total projected benefit obligations of the combined us and international plans 

one of the critical assumptions used in the actuarial model is the discount rate which is used to estimate the present value of future cash outflows necessary to meet projected benefit obligations for the specific plan it is the estimated interest rate that vf could use to settle its projected benefit obligations at the valuation date the discount rate assumption is based on current market interest rates vf selects a discount rate for each of the us pension plans by matching high quality corporate bond yields to the timing of projected benefit payments to participants in each plan vf uses 

 

the population of us corporate bonds rated ‘aa’ by moody’s investors service or standard  poor’s ratings services vf excludes the highest and lowest yielding bonds from this population of approximately 919 such bonds the bonds must be noncallablenonputable unless makewhole provisions exist each plan’s projected benefit payments are matched to current market interest rates over the expected payment period to calculate an associated present value a single equivalent discount rate is then determined that produces the same present value the resulting discount rate is reflective of both the current interest rate environment and the plan’s distinct liability characteristics vf believes that those ‘aa’ rated issues meet the “high quality” intent of the applicable accounting standards and that the march 2020 discount rates of 344 for the us qualified defined benefit pension plan and 346 for the unfunded supplemental defined benefit plan appropriately reflect current market conditions and the longterm nature of projected benefit payments to participants in the us pension plans 

vf utilizes the spot rate approach to measure service and interest costs under the spot rate approach the full yield curve is applied separately to cash flows for each projected benefit obligation service cost and interest cost for a more precise calculation 

another critical assumption of the actuarial model is the expected longterm rate of return on investments vf’s investment objective is to invest in a diversified portfolio of assets with an acceptable level of risk to maximize the longterm return while minimizing volatility in the value of plan assets relative to the value of plan liabilities these risks include market interest rate credit liquidity regulatory and foreign securities risks investment assets consist of cash equivalents us and international equity corporate and governmental fixedincome securities insurance contracts and alternative assets vf develops a projected rate of return for each of the investment asset classes based on many factors including historical and expected returns the estimated inflation rate the premium to be earned in excess of a riskfree return the premium for equity risk and the premium for longer duration fixedincome securities the weighted average projected longterm rates of return of the various assets held by the us qualified plan provide the basis for the expected longterm rate of return 

vf corporation fiscal 2020 form 10k 45 

actuarial assumption vf’s rate of return assumption was 570 and 550 in the year ended march 2020 due to the december 2019 interim remeasurement for the lumpsum offer settlement event 570 in the year ended march 2019  585 in the three months ended march 2018 and 600 in the year ended december 2017 in recent years vf has altered the investment mix by i increasing the allocation to fixedincome investments and reducing the allocation to equity investments and ii increasing the allocation in equities to more international investments the changes in asset allocation are anticipated over time to reduce the yeartoyear variability of the us qualified plan’s funded status and impact on pension expense management monitors the plan’s asset allocation to balance risk with anticipated investment returns in a given year based on an evaluation of market conditions and projected market returns vf will be using a rate of return assumption of 525 for the us qualified defined benefit pension plan for fiscal 2021 

we consistently review all of our demographic assumptions as part of the normal management of our defined benefit plans and update these assumptions as appropriate the company performed a demographic assumptions study in 2017 and updated the assumptions as necessary in the year ended march 2019 valuations 

vf utilizes the rp2014 base table and mp2014 mortality improvement scale which were adjusted for characteristics of our planspecific populations and other data where appropriate in developing our best estimate of the expected mortality rates of plan participants in the us pension plans in 2019 the society of actuaries soa issue a new mortality table pri2012 and improvement scale mp2019 which reflect a decrease in life expectancies compared to the previous table and scales management considered the pri2012 table and mp2019 scale and determined they are directionally consistent with the current assumptions and concluded no change was needed for the year ended march 2020  

 

differences between actual results in a given year and the actuarially determined assumed results for that year eg investment performance discount rates and other assumptions do not affect that year’s pension expense but instead are deferred as unrecognized actuarial gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the consolidated balance sheet at the end of fiscal 2020 for all pension plans there were 3580 million of pretax accumulated deferred actuarial losses plus 07 million of pretax net deferred prior service credits resulting in an aftertax amount of  2625 million in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the march 2020 consolidated balance sheet the net deferred loss will be amortized as a component of pension expense 

pension expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements was 236 million in the year ended march 2020  397 million in the year ended march 2019  46 million in the three months ended march 2018 and 348 million in the year ended december 2017 respectively pension expense for the year ended march 2020 was higher as it included a 230 million settlement charge resulting from 2400 participants accepting a onetime option to receive a distribution of their deferred vested benefits refer to note 16  the cost of pension benefits actually earned each year by covered active employees commonly called “service cost” was 145 million in the year ended march 2020 224 million in the year ended march 2019  59 million in the three months ended march 2018 and 249 million in the year ended december 2017 pension expense was lower in the year ended march 2020 compared to the year ended march 2019 due primarily to lower service costs due to the freeze in future benefit accruals in the us qualified and nonqualified plans lower amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses and lower interest costs resulting from lower interest rates looking forward vf expects pension income for the next 12 months of approximately 87 million primarily due to expected return on plan assets exceeding the other components of pension expense 

the sensitivity of changes in actuarial assumptions on fiscal 2020 pension expense and on projected benefit obligations related to the us defined benefit pension plan at the end of fiscal 2020  all other factors being equal is illustrated by the following 



as discussed in the “risk management” section above vf has taken a series of steps to reduce volatility in the pension plans and their impact on the financial statements on a longerterm basis vf believes the yeartoyear variability of the retirement benefit expense should decrease 

46 vf corporation fiscal 2020 form 10k 



as a global company vf is subject to income taxes and files income tax returns in over 100 us and foreign jurisdictions each year due to economic and political conditions tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change the company could be subject to changes in its tax rates the adoption of new us or international tax legislation or changes in interpretation of existing tax laws and regulations or rulings by courts or government authorities leading to exposure to additional tax liabilities in particular tax authorities and the courts have increased their focus on income earned in no or lowtax jurisdictions or income that is not taxed in any jurisdiction tax authorities have also become skeptical of special tax rulings provided to companies offering lower taxes than may be applicable in other countries vf makes an ongoing assessment to identify any significant exposure related to increases in tax rates in the jurisdictions in which vf operates 

as discussed in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements vf has been granted a lower effective income tax rate on taxable earnings in certain foreign jurisdictions 

furthermore in february 2015 the european union commission “eu” opened a state aid investigation into belgium’s tax rulings on january 11 2016 the eu announced its decision that these rulings were illegal and ordered that tax benefits granted under these rulings should be collected from the affected companies including vf on march 22 2016 the belgium government filed an appeal seeking annulment of the eu decision additionally on june 21 2016 vf europe bvba filed its own application for annulment of the eu decision on december 22 2016 belgium adopted a law which entitled the belgium tax authorities to issue tax assessments and demand timely payments from companies which benefited from the excess profits regime on january 10 2017 vf europe bvba received an assessment for €319 million tax and interest related to excess profits benefits received in prior years vf europe bvba remitted €319 million  339 million  on january 13 2017 which was recorded as an income tax receivable in 2017 based on the expected success of the aforementioned requests for annulment an additional assessment of €31 million  38 million  was received and paid in january 2018 on february 14 2019 the general court annulled the eu decision and on april 26 2019 the eu appealed the general court’s annulment both listed requests for annulment remain open and unresolved additionally the eu has initiated proceedings related to individual rulings granted by belgium including the ruling granted to vf if this matter is adversely resolved these amounts will not be collected by vf 

the calculation of income tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations which are subject to legal interpretation and significant management judgment vf’s income tax returns are regularly examined by 

 

federal state and foreign tax authorities and those audits may result in proposed adjustments vf has reviewed all issues raised upon examination as well as any exposure for issues that may be raised in future examinations vf has evaluated these potential issues under the “morelikelythannot” standard of the accounting literature a tax position is recognized if it meets this standard and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized such judgments and estimates may change based on audit settlements court cases and interpretation of tax laws and regulations income tax expense could be materially affected to the extent vf prevails in a tax position or when the statute of limitations expires for a tax position for which a liability for unrecognized tax benefits or valuation allowances have been established or to the extent vf is required to pay amounts greater than the established liability for unrecognized tax benefits vf does not currently anticipate any material impact on earnings from the ultimate resolution of income tax uncertainties there are no accruals for general or unknown tax expenses 

as of march 2020 vf has 2373 million of gross deferred income tax assets related to operating loss and capital loss carryforwards and 1666 million of valuation allowances against those assets realization of deferred tax assets related to operating loss and capital loss carryforwards is dependent on future taxable income in specific jurisdictions the amount and timing of which are uncertain and on possible changes in tax laws if management believes that vf will not be able to generate sufficient taxable income or capital gains to offset losses during the carryforward periods vf records valuation allowances to reduce those deferred tax assets to amounts expected to be ultimately realized if in a future period management determines that the amount of deferred tax assets to be realized differs from the net recorded amount vf would record an adjustment to income tax expense in that future period 

on may 19 2019 switzerland voted to approve the federal act on tax reform and ahv financing “swiss tax act” provisions of the swiss tax act were enacted for swiss federal purposes during the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and later enacted for certain cantons during the fourth quarter in addition to changes to the federal and cantonal tax rates there were transitional measures allowing companies to recognize a stepup in tax basis that is subsequently amortized over a period of time calculation of the additional tax basis involves estimates and application of specific guidelines determined by the swiss federal authorities as well as through ongoing discussions with swiss cantonal tax authorities these provisions resulted in adjustments to deferred tax assets and liabilities such that a net tax benefit of 936 million was recorded in the year ended march 2020

our directtoconsumer business includes fullprice stores outlet stores ecommerce sites and concession retail locations directtoconsumer revenues were 33  of total vf revenues in the year ended march 2019  

our fullprice stores allow us to display a brand’s full line of products with fixtures and imagery that support the brand’s positioning and promise to consumers these experiences provide high visibility for our brands and products and enable us to stay close to the needs and preferences of our consumers the complete and impactful presentation of products in our stores also helps to increase sellthrough of vf products at our wholesale customers due to increased brand awareness education and visibility vfoperated fullprice stores generally provide gross margins that are well above vf averages 

in addition vf operates outlet stores in both premium outlet malls and more traditional valuebased locations these outlet stores carry merchandise that is specifically designed for sale in our outlet stores and serve an important role in our overall inventory management and profitability by allowing vf to sell a significant portion of excess discontinued and outofseason products at better prices than otherwise available from outside parties while maintaining the integrity of our brands 

our growing global directtoconsumer operations included 1551  stores at the end of fiscal 2019  we operate retail store locations for the following brands vans ®  timberland ®  the north face ®  kipling ®  dickies ®  lee ®  napapijri ®  icebreaker ®  and wrangler ®  we also operate 79   vf outlet ™ stores in the us that sell a broad selection of excess vf products as well as other nonvf products approximately 66 of vfoperated stores offer products at full price and the remainder are outlet locations approximately 60 of our stores are located in the americas region 48 in the us

we expect our directtoconsumer business to continue growing as we expand our ecommerce presence and open new stores we opened 110  stores during fiscal 2019  concentrating on the brands with the highest retail growth potential vans ® and the north face ®  

in addition to our directtoconsumer operations our licensees distributors and other independent parties own and operate over 3000  partnership stores these are primarily monobrand retail locations selling vf products that have the appearance of vfoperated stores most of these partnership stores are located in europe and asia and are concentrated in the timberland ®  the north face ®  vans ®  lee ®  dickies ®  wrangler ®  kipling ®  and napapijri ® brands 

the vf outlet ™  business and stores are included in the spinoff of the jeans business that was completed on may 22 2019 which is also discussed in the jeans segment section above 



as part of our strategy of expanding market penetration of vfowned brands we enter into licensing agreements with independent parties for specific apparel and complementary product categories when such arrangements provide more effective manufacturing distribution and marketing than could be achieved internally we provide support to these business partners and ensure the integrity of our brand names by taking an active role in the design quality control advertising marketing and distribution of licensed products 

 

licensing arrangements relate to a broad range of vf brands license agreements are for fixed terms of generally 3 to 5 years with conditional renewal options each licensee pays royalties to vf based on its sales of licensed products with most agreements providing for a minimum royalty requirement royalties generally range from 4 to 10 of the licensing partners’ net licensed products sales royalty income was 959 million  in the year ended march 2019  less than 1  of total revenues primarily from the vans ®  dickies ®  lee ®  wrangler ®  and timberland ® brands 



product design and innovation including fit fabric finish and quality are important elements across our businesses these functions are performed by employees located in our global supply chain organization and our branded business units across the globe 

in addition to the design functions of each brand vf has three strategic global innovation centers that focus on technical and performance product development for apparel footwear and jeanswear the centers are staffed with dedicated scientists engineers and designers who combine proprietary insights with consumer needs and a deep understanding of technology and new 

 

materials these innovation centers are integral to vf’s longterm growth as they allow us to deliver new products and experiences that consistently delight consumers which drives organic growth and higher gross margins 

vf’s centralized global supply chain organization is responsible for producing procuring and delivering products to our customers vf is highly skilled in managing the complexities associated with our global supply chain vf sourced or produced approximately 560 million  units spread across our brands our products are obtained from 19  vfoperated manufacturing facilities and approximately 700  independent contractor manufacturing facilities in 

vf corporation fiscal 2019 form 10k 5 

approximately 60  countries additionally we operate 40  distribution centers and 1551  retail stores managing this complexity is made possible by the use of a network of information systems for product development forecasting order management and warehouse management along with our core enterprise resource management platforms 

in the year ended march 2019  21  of our units were manufactured in vfowned facilities and 79  were obtained from independent contractors products manufactured in vf facilities generally have a lower cost and shorter lead times than products procured from independent contractors products obtained from contractors in the western hemisphere generally have a higher cost than products obtained from contractors in asia however contracting in the western hemisphere gives us greater flexibility shorter lead times and allows for lower inventory levels this combination of vfowned and contracted production along with different geographic regions and cost structures provides a wellbalanced flexible approach to product sourcing we will continue to manage our supply chain from a global perspective and adjust as needed to changes in the global production environment 

vf operates manufacturing facilities in the us mexico central america and the caribbean a significant percentage of denim bottoms and occupational apparel is manufactured in these plants as well as a smaller percentage of footwear and other products for these owned production facilities we purchase raw materials from numerous us and international suppliers to meet our production needs raw materials include products made from cotton leather rubber wool synthetics and blends of cotton and synthetic yarn as well as thread and trim product identification buttons zippers snaps eyelets and laces in some instances we contract the sewing of vfowned raw materials into finished product with independent contractors fixed price commitments for fabric and certain supplies are generally set on a quarterly basis for the next quarter’s purchases no single supplier represents more than 10 of our total cost of goods sold 

independent contractors generally own the raw materials and ship finished readyforsale products to vf these contractors are engaged through vf sourcing hubs in hong kong with satellite offices across asia and panama these hubs are responsible for managing the manufacturing and procurement of product supplier oversight product quality assurance sustainability within the supply chain responsible sourcing and transportation and shipping functions in addition our hubs leverage proprietary knowledge and technology to enable certain contractors to more effectively control costs and improve labor efficiency substantially all products in the outdoor and active segments as well as a portion of products for our work and jeans segments are obtained through these sourcing hubs 

management continually monitors political risks and developments related to duties tariffs and quotas we limit vf’s 

 

sourcing exposure through among other measures i diversifying geographies with a mix of vfoperated and contracted production ii shifting of production among countries and contractors iii sourcing production to merchandise categories where product is readily available and iv sourcing from countries with tariff preference and free trade agreements vf does not directly or indirectly source products from suppliers in countries that are prohibited by the us state department 

all vfoperated production facilities throughout the world as well as all independent contractor facilities that manufacture vf products must comply with vf’s global compliance principles these principles established in 1997 and consistent with international labor standards are a set of strict standards covering legal and ethical business practices worker age work hours health and safety conditions environmental standards and compliance with local laws and regulations in addition our owned factories must also undergo certification by the independent nonprofit organization worldwide responsible accredited production “wrap” which promotes global ethics in manufacturing 

vf through its contractor monitoring program audits the activities of the independent businesses and contractors that produce vf products at locations across the globe each of the approximately 700  independent contractor facilities including those serving our independent licensees must be precertified before producing vf products this precertification includes passing a factory inspection and signing a vf terms of engagement agreement we maintain an ongoing audit program to ensure compliance with these requirements by using dedicated internal staff and externally contracted firms additional information about vf’s code of business conduct global compliance principles terms of engagement and environmental compliance guidelines along with a global compliance report is available on the vf website at wwwvfccom 

vf did not experience difficulty in fulfilling its raw material and contracting production needs during fiscal 2019  absent any material changes vf believes it would be able to largely offset any increases in product costs through i the continuing shift in the mix of its business to higher margin brands geographies and channels of distribution ii increases in the prices of its products and iii cost reduction efforts the loss of any one supplier or contractor would not have a significant adverse effect on our business 

product is shipped from our independent suppliers and vfoperated manufacturing facilities to distribution centers around the world in some instances product is shipped directly to our customers most distribution centers are operated by vf and some support more than one brand a portion of our distribution needs are met by contract distribution centers

vf’s quarterly operating results vary due to the seasonality of our individual brands and are historically stronger in the second half of the calendar year on a quarterly basis in fiscal 2019  revenues ranged from a low of 20  of full year revenues in the first  fiscal quarter to a high of 29  in the third  fiscal quarter while operating margin ranged from a low of 6  in the fourth  fiscal quarter to a high of 17  in the second  fiscal quarter this variation results primarily from the seasonal influences on revenues of our outdoor segment where 12  of the segment’s revenues occurred in the first  fiscal quarter compared to 35  in the third  fiscal quarter of fiscal 2019  with changes in our mix of business and the growth 

 

of our retail operations historical quarterly revenue and profit trends may not be indicative of future trends 

working capital requirements vary throughout the year working capital increases early in the calendar year as inventory builds to support peak shipping periods and then moderates later in the year as those inventories are sold and accounts receivable are collected cash provided by operating activities is substantially higher in the second half of the calendar year due to higher net income during that period and reduced working capital requirements particularly during the fourth quarter of the calendar year 



during the year ended march 2019  our advertising and promotion expense was 8457 million  representing 6  of total revenues we advertise in consumer and trade publications on radio and television and through digital initiatives including social media and mobile platforms on the internet we also participate in cooperative advertising on a shared cost basis with major retailers in print and digital media radio and television we sponsor sporting musical and special events as well as athletes and personalities who promote our products we employ marketing sciences to optimize the impact of advertising and promotional spending and to identify the types of spending that provide the greatest return on our marketing investments 

we provide advertising support to our wholesale customers including independent partnership stores in the form of pointofsale fixtures and signage to enhance the presentation and brand image of our products we also participate in shopinshops and concession retail arrangements which are separate sales areas dedicated to a specific vf brand within our customers stores and other locations to help differentiate and enhance the presentation of our products 

we contribute to incentive programs with our wholesale customers including cooperative advertising funds discounts and 

 

allowances we also offer sales incentive programs directly to consumers in the form of discounts rebates and coupon offers that are eligible for use in certain vfoperated stores brand ecommerce sites and concession retail locations 

in addition to sponsorships and activities that directly benefit our products and brands vf and its associates actively support our communities and various charities for example the north face ® brand has committed to programs that encourage and enable outdoor participation such as the north face endurance challenge ®  and the north face explore fund™  programs the timberland ® brand has a strong heritage of volunteerism including the path of service™  program that offers fulltime employees up to 40 hours of paid time off a year to serve their local communities through global service events such as earth day in the spring and servapalooza in the fall the wrangler ®  brand launched the tough enough to wear pink ™ program which honors and raises money for breast cancer survivors and the national patriot program™  which funds agencies that serve wounded and fallen american military veterans and their families the vans ®  brand has hosted annual vans ®  earth day and vans ®  gives back day events in which all employees at the brands headquarters spend the day volunteering in the community

 item 1a risk factors 

tableend

the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating vf’s business and the forwardlooking statements contained in this form 10k any of the following risks could materially adversely affect vf’s business its operating results and its financial condition 

vf’s revenues and profits depend on the level of consumer spending for apparel and footwear which is sensitive to global economic conditions and other factors a decline in consumer spending could have a material adverse effect on vf 

the success of vf’s business depends on consumer spending on apparel and footwear and there are a number of factors that influence consumer spending including actual and perceived economic conditions disposable consumer income interest rates consumer credit availability unemployment stock market performance weather conditions energy prices consumer discretionary spending patterns and tax rates in the international national regional and local markets where vf’s products are sold the current global economic environment is unpredictable and adverse economic trends or other factors could negatively impact the level of consumer spending which could have a material adverse impact on vf 

the apparel and footwear industries are highly competitive and vf’s success depends on its ability to gauge consumer preferences and product trends and to respond to constantly changing markets 

vf competes with numerous apparel and footwear brands and manufacturers competition is generally based upon brand name recognition price design product quality selection service and purchasing convenience some of our competitors are larger and have more resources than vf in some product categories and regions in addition vf competes directly with the private label brands of its wholesale customers vf’s ability to compete within the apparel and footwear industries depends on our ability to 

 failure to compete effectively or to keep pace with rapidly changing consumer preferences markets and product trends could have a material adverse effect on vf’s business financial condition and results of operations moreover there are significant shifts underway in the wholesale and retail ecommerce and retail store channels vf may not be able to manage its brands within and across channels sufficiently which could have a material adverse 

 

effect on vf’s business financial condition and results of operations 

vf’s results of operations could be materially harmed if we are unable to accurately forecast demand for our products 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully anticipate changing consumer preferences and product trends or economic conditions and as a result we may not successfully manage inventory levels to meet our future order requirements we often schedule internal production and place orders for products with independent manufacturers before our customers’ orders are firm if we fail to accurately forecast consumer demand we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of product required to meet the demand inventory levels in excess of consumer demand may result in inventory writedowns the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices or excess inventory held by our wholesale customers which could have a negative impact on future sales an adverse effect on the image and reputation of vf’s brands and negatively impact profitability on the other hand if we underestimate demand for our products our manufacturing facilities or thirdparty manufacturers may not be able to produce products to meet consumer requirements and this could result in delays in the shipment of products and lost revenues as well as damage to vf’s reputation and relationships these risks could have a material adverse effect on our brand image as well as our results of operations and financial condition 

vf’s business and the success of its products could be harmed if vf is unable to maintain the images of its brands 

vf’s success to date has been due in large part to the growth of its brands’ images and vf’s customers’ connection to its brands if we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to changing consumer demand the names and images of our brands may be impaired even if we react appropriately to changes in consumer preferences consumers may consider our brands’ images to be outdated or associate our brands with styles that are no longer popular in addition brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of qualities including merchandise quality and corporate integrity negative claims or publicity regarding vf its brands or its products including licensed products could adversely affect our reputation and sales regardless of whether such claims are accurate social media which accelerates the dissemination of information can increase the challenges of responding to negative claims in the past many apparel companies have experienced periods of rapid growth in sales and earnings followed by periods of declining sales and losses our businesses may be similarly affected in the future in addition we have sponsorship contracts with a number of athletes musicians and celebrities and feature those individuals in our advertising and marketing efforts actions taken by those individuals associated with our products could harm their reputations which could adversely affect the images of our brands 

vf’s revenues and cash requirements are affected by the seasonal nature of its business 

vf’s business is increasingly seasonal with a higher proportion of revenues and operating cash flows generated during the second half of the calendar year which includes the fall and holiday selling seasons poor sales in the second half of the calendar year would have a material adverse effect on vf’s full year operating results and cause higher inventories in addition fluctuations in sales and 

10          vf corporation fiscal 2019 form 10k 

operating income in any fiscal quarter are affected by the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales 

vf’s profitability may decline as a result of increasing pressure on margins 

the apparel industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors including intense competition consolidation in the retail industry rising commodity and conversion costs pressure from retailers to reduce the costs of products changes in consumer demand and shifts to online shopping and purchasing consumers may increasingly seek markdown allowances incentives and other forms of economic support if these factors cause us to reduce our sales prices to retailers and consumers and we fail to sufficiently reduce our product costs or operating expenses vf’s profitability will decline this could have a material adverse effect on vf’s results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

vf may not succeed in its business strategy 

one of vf’s key strategic objectives is growth we seek to grow organically and through acquisitions we seek to grow by building our lifestyle brands expanding our share with winning customers stretching vf’s brands to new regions managing costs leveraging our supply chain and information technology capabilities across vf and expanding our directtoconsumer business including opening new stores remodeling and expanding our existing stores and growing our ecommerce business however we may not be able to grow our existing businesses for example 

 failure to implement our strategic objectives may have a material adverse effect on vf’s business 

 

vf relies significantly on information technology any inadequacy interruption integration failure or security failure of this technology could harm vf’s ability to effectively operate its business 

our ability to effectively manage and operate our business depends significantly on information technology systems we rely heavily on information technology to track sales and inventory and manage our supply chain we are also dependent on information technology including the internet for our directtoconsumer sales including our ecommerce operations and retail business credit card transaction authorization despite our preventative efforts our systems and those of our thirdparty service providers may be vulnerable to damage failure or interruption due to viruses data security incidents technical malfunctions natural disasters or other causes or in connection with upgrades to our system or the implementation of new systems the failure of these systems to operate effectively problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems difficulty in integrating new systems or systems of acquired businesses or a breach in security of these systems could adversely impact the operations of vf’s business including management of inventory ordering and replenishment of products manufacturing and distribution or products ecommerce operations retail business credit card transaction authorization and processing corporate email communications and our interaction with the public on social media 

vf is subject to data security and privacy risks that could negatively affect its business operations results of operations or reputation 

in the normal course of business we often collect retain and transmit certain sensitive and confidential customer information including credit card information over public networks there is a significant concern by consumers and employees over the security of personal information transmitted over the internet identity theft and user privacy data security attacks are increasingly sophisticated and if unauthorized parties gain access to our networks or databases or those of our thirdparty service providers they may be able to steal publish delete or modify our private and sensitive information including credit card information and personal information despite the security measures we currently have in place our facilities and systems and those of our thirdparty service providers may be vulnerable and unable to anticipate or detect security breaches and data loss in addition employees may intentionally or inadvertently cause data security breaches that result in the unauthorized release of personal or confidential information vf and its customers could suffer harm if valuable business data or employee customer and other proprietary information were corrupted lost or accessed or misappropriated by third parties due to a security failure in vf’s systems or one of our thirdparty service providers it could require significant expenditures to remediate any such failure or breach severely damage our reputation and our relationships with customers results in unwanted media attention and lost sales and expose us to risks of litigation and liability in addition as a result of recent security breaches at a number of prominent retailers the media and public scrutiny of information security and privacy has become more intense and the regulatory environment has become increasingly uncertain rigorous and complex as a result we may incur significant costs to comply with laws regarding the protection and unauthorized disclosure of personal information and we may not be able to comply with new regulations such as the general data protection regulation in the european union and the california consumer privacy act any failure to comply with the laws and regulations surrounding the protection of personal information could subject us to legal and reputational 

vf corporation fiscal 2019 form 10k 11 

risk including significant fines for noncompliance any of which could have a negative impact on revenues and profits 

vf’s business is exposed to the risks of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations vf’s hedging strategies may not be effective in mitigating those risks 

a growing percentage of vf’s total revenues approximately 41  in fiscal 2019  is derived from markets outside the us vf’s international businesses operate in functional currencies other than the us dollar changes in currency exchange rates affect the us dollar value of the foreign currencydenominated amounts at which vf’s international businesses purchase products incur costs or sell products in addition for vf’s usbased businesses the majority of products are sourced from independent contractors or vf plants located in foreign countries as a result the costs of these products are affected by changes in the value of the relevant currencies furthermore much of vf’s licensing revenue is derived from sales in foreign currencies changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse impact on vf’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in accordance with our operating practices we hedge a significant portion of our foreign currency transaction exposures arising in the ordinary course of business to reduce risks in our cash flows and earnings our hedging strategy may not be effective in reducing all risks and no hedging strategy can completely insulate vf from foreign exchange risk 

further our use of derivative financial instruments may expose vf to counterparty risks although vf only enters into hedging contracts with counterparties having investment grade credit ratings it is possible that the credit quality of a counterparty could be downgraded or a counterparty could default on its obligations which could have a material adverse impact on vf’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

there are risks associated with vf’s acquisitions 

any acquisitions or mergers by vf will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of companies these risks include among other things higher than anticipated acquisition costs and expenses the difficulty and expense of integrating the operations systems and personnel of the companies and the loss of key employees and customers as a result of changes in management in addition geographic distances may make integration of acquired businesses more difficult we may not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with any acquisitions 

our acquisitions may cause large onetime expenses or create goodwill or other intangible assets that could result in significant impairment charges in the future we also make certain estimates and assumptions in order to determine purchase price allocation and estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed if our estimates or assumptions used to value these assets and liabilities are not accurate we may be exposed to losses that may be material 

vf’s operations and earnings may be affected by legal regulatory political and economic risks 

our ability to maintain the current level of operations in our existing markets and to capitalize on growth in existing and new markets is subject to legal regulatory political and economic risks these include the burdens of complying with us and international laws 

 

and regulations unexpected changes in regulatory requirements tariffs or other trade barriers and the economic uncertainty associated with the pending exit of the united kingdom from the european union brexit or any other similar referendums that may be held 

a significant portion of vfs fiscal 2019 net income was earned in jurisdictions outside the us and most of our goods are manufactured outside the us vf is exposed to risks of changes in us policy for companies having business operations and manufacturing products outside the us we cannot predict any changes to us participation in or renegotiations of certain trade agreements or whether quotas duties taxes exchange controls or other restrictions will be imposed by the us china the european union or other countries on the import or export of our products or what effect any of these actions would have on vf’s business financial condition or results of operations changes in regulatory geopolitical policies and other factors may adversely affect vf’s business or may require us to modify our current business practices while enactment of any such change is not certain if such changes were adopted our costs could increase which would reduce our earnings 

changes in tax laws could increase our worldwide tax rate and materially affect our financial position and results of operations 

we are subject to taxation in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” which included a broad range of tax reform proposals affecting businesses including a reduction in the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 a onetime mandatory deemed repatriation tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously taxdeferred and a new minimum tax on certain foreign earnings the tax act significantly impacted our effective tax rate for the year ended december 2017 as a result of the deemed repatriation tax and may continue to impact several other elements of our operating model certain additional provisions of the tax act such as a minimum tax on foreign earnings could also apply to vf depending on certain facts and circumstances and as a result could increase our effective tax rate taxes due over a period of time as a result of the new tax law could be accelerated upon certain triggering events including failure to pay such taxes when due the new law made broad and complex changes to the us tax code and regulatory administrative and legislative guidance continues to be released to the extent any future guidance differs from our preliminary interpretation of the law it could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 

in addition many countries in the european union and around the globe have adopted andor proposed changes to current tax laws further organizations such as the organisation for economic cooperation and development have published action plans that if adopted by countries where we do business could increase our tax obligations in these countries due to the large scale of our us and international business activities many of these enacted and proposed changes to the taxation of our activities could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations 

we may have additional tax liabilities 

as a global company we determine our income tax liability in various tax jurisdictions based on an analysis and interpretation of local tax laws and regulations this analysis requires a significant 

12          vf corporation fiscal 2019 form 10k 

amount of judgment and estimation and is often based on various assumptions about the future actions of the local tax authorities these determinations are the subject of periodic us and international tax audits although we accrue for uncertain tax positions our accrual may be insufficient to satisfy unfavorable findings unfavorable audit findings and tax rulings may result in payment of taxes fines and penalties for prior periods and higher tax rates in future periods which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

the company petitioned the us tax court to resolve an internal revenue service irs dispute regarding the timing of income inclusion associated with the 2011 timberland acquisition the company remains confident in our timing and treatment of the income inclusion and therefore this matter is not reflected in our financial statements we are vigorously defending our position and do not expect the resolution to have a material adverse impact on the companys financial position results of operations or cash flows while the irs argues immediate income inclusion the companys position is to include the income over a period of years as the matter relates to 2011 nearly half of the timing at dispute has passed with the company including the income and paying the related tax on our income tax returns the company notes that should the irs prevail in this timing matter the net interest expense would be up to 130 million further this timing matter is impacted by the tax act that reduced the us corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 if the irs is successful this rate differential would increase tax expense by approximately 136 million 

vf’s balance sheet includes a significant amount of intangible assets and goodwill a decline in the fair value of an intangible asset or of a business unit could result in an asset impairment charge which would be recorded as an operating expense in vf’s consolidated statement of income and could be material 

vf’s policy is to evaluate indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill for possible impairment as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of such assets may be below their carrying amount in addition intangible assets that are being amortized are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable for these impairment tests we use various valuation methods to estimate the fair value of our business units and intangible assets if the fair value of an asset is less than its carrying value we would recognize an impairment charge for the difference 

it is possible that we could have an impairment charge for goodwill or trademark and trade name intangible assets in future periods if i overall economic conditions in fiscal 2020 or future years vary from our current assumptions ii business conditions or our strategies for a specific business unit change from our current assumptions iii investors require higher rates of return on equity investments in the marketplace or iv enterprise values of comparable publicly traded companies or of actual sales transactions of comparable companies were to decline resulting in lower comparable multiples of revenues and earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and accordingly lower implied values of goodwill and intangible assets a future impairment charge for goodwill or intangible assets could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

 

vf uses thirdparty suppliers and manufacturing facilities worldwide for a substantial portion of its raw materials and finished products which poses risks to vf’s business operations 

during fiscal 2019  approximately 79  of vf’s units were purchased from independent manufacturers primarily located in asia with substantially all of the remainder produced by vfowned and operated manufacturing facilities located in the us mexico central america and the caribbean any of the following could impact our ability to produce or deliver vf products or our cost of producing or delivering products and as a result our profitability 

 although no single supplier and no one country is critical to vf’s production needs if we were to lose a supplier it could result in interruption of finished goods shipments to vf cancellation of orders by customers and termination of relationships this along with the damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on vf’s revenues and consequently our results of operations 

in addition although we audit our thirdparty material suppliers and contracted manufacturing facilities and set strict compliance standards actions by a thirdparty supplier or manufacturer that fail to comply could expose vf to claims for damages financial penalties and reputational harm any of which could have a material adverse effect in our business and operations 

vf corporation fiscal 2019 form 10k 13 

our business is subject to national state and local laws and regulations for environmental consumer protection employment privacy safety and other matters the costs of compliance with or the violation of such laws and regulations by vf or by independent suppliers who manufacture products for vf could have an adverse effect on our operations and cash flows as well as on our reputation 

our business is subject to comprehensive national state and local laws and regulations on a wide range of environmental consumer protection employment privacy safety and other matters vf could be adversely affected by costs of compliance with or violations of those laws and regulations in addition while we do not control their business practices we require thirdparty suppliers to operate in compliance with applicable laws rules and regulations regarding working conditions employment practices and environmental compliance the costs of products purchased by vf from independent contractors could increase due to the costs of compliance by those contractors 

failure by vf or its thirdparty suppliers to comply with such laws and regulations as well as with ethical social product labor and environmental standards or related political considerations could result in interruption of finished goods shipments to vf cancellation of orders by customers and termination of relationships if one of our independent contractors violates labor or other laws implements labor or other business practices or takes other actions that are generally regarded as unethical it could jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions including boycotts that may reduce demand for vf’s merchandise damage to vf’s reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on vf’s results of operations financial condition and cash flows as well as require additional resources to rebuild vf’s reputation 

fluctuations in wage rates and the price availability and quality of raw materials and finished goods could increase costs 

fluctuations in the price availability and quality of fabrics leather or other raw materials used by vf in its manufactured products or of purchased finished goods could have a material adverse effect on vf’s cost of goods sold or its ability to meet its customers’ demands the prices we pay depend on demand and market prices for the raw materials used to produce them the price and availability of such raw materials may fluctuate significantly depending on many factors including general economic conditions and demand crop yields energy prices weather patterns and speculation in the commodities markets prices of purchased finished products also depend on wage rates in asia and other geographic areas where our independent contractors are located as well as freight costs from those regions inflation can also have a longterm impact on us because increasing costs of materials and labor may impact our ability to maintain satisfactory margins for example the cost of the materials that are used in our manufacturing process such as oilrelated commodity prices and other raw materials such as cotton dyes and chemical and other costs such as fuel energy and utility costs can fluctuate as a result of inflation and other factors similarly a significant portion of our products are manufactured in other countries and declines in the values of the us dollar may result in higher manufacturing costsin addition fluctuations in wage rates required by legal or industry standards could increase our costs in the future vf may not be able to offset cost increases with other cost reductions or efficiencies or to pass higher costs on to its customers this could have a material adverse effect on vf’s results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

 

we may be adversely affected by weather conditions 

our business is adversely affected by unseasonable weather conditions a significant portion of the sales of our products is dependent in part on the weather and is likely to decline in years in which weather conditions do not favor the use of these products for example periods of unseasonably warm weather in the fall or winter can lead to inventory accumulation by our wholesale customers which can in turn negatively affect orders in future seasons in addition abnormally harsh or inclement weather can also negatively impact retail traffic and consumer spending any and all of these risks may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

a substantial portion of vf’s revenues and gross profit is derived from a small number of large customers the loss of any of these customers or the inability of any of these customers to pay vf could substantially reduce vf’s revenues and profits 

a few of vf’s customers account for a significant portion of revenues sales to vf’s ten largest customers were 19  of total revenues in fiscal 2019  with our largest customer accounting for 8  of revenues sales to our customers are generally on a purchase order basis and not subject to longterm agreements a decision by any of vf’s major customers to significantly decrease the volume of products purchased from vf could substantially reduce revenues and have a material adverse effect on vf’s financial condition and results of operations 

the retail industry has experienced financial difficulty that could adversely affect vfs business 

recently there have been consolidations reorganizations restructurings bankruptcies and ownership changes in the retail industry these events individually and together could materially adversely affect vfs business these changes could impact vf’s opportunities in the market and increase vf’s reliance on a smaller number of large customers in the future retailers are likely to further consolidate undergo restructurings or reorganizations or bankruptcies realign their affiliations or reposition their stores’ target markets in addition consumers have continued to transition away from traditional wholesale retailers to large online retailers these developments could result in a reduction in the number of stores that carry vf’s products an increase in ownership concentration within the retail industry an increase in credit exposure to vf or an increase in leverage by vf’s customers over their suppliers 

further the global economy periodically experiences recessionary conditions with rising unemployment reduced availability of credit increased savings rates and declines in real estate and securities values these recessionary conditions could have a negative impact on retail sales of apparel and other consumer products the lower sales volumes along with the possibility of restrictions on access to the credit markets could result in our customers experiencing financial difficulties including store closures bankruptcies or liquidations this could result in higher credit risk to vf relating to receivables from our customers who are experiencing these financial difficulties if these developments occur our inability to shift sales to other customers or to collect on vf’s trade accounts receivable could have a material adverse effect on vf’s financial condition and results of operations 

14          vf corporation fiscal 2019 form 10k 

our ability to obtain shortterm or longterm financing on favorable terms if needed could be adversely affected by geopolitical risk and volatility in the capital markets 

any disruption in the capital markets could limit the availability of funds or the ability or willingness of financial institutions to extend capital in the future this could adversely affect our liquidity and funding resources or significantly increase our cost of capital an inability to access capital and credit markets may have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

vf has a global revolving credit facility one or more of the participating banks may not be able to honor their commitments which could have an adverse effect on vf’s business 

vf has a 225 billion global revolving credit facility that expires in december 2023 if the financial markets return to recessionary conditions this could impair the ability of one or more of the banks participating in our credit agreements to honor their commitments this could have an adverse effect on our business if we were not able to replace those commitments or to locate other sources of liquidity on acceptable terms 

the loss of members of vf’s executive management and other key employees could have a material adverse effect on its business 

vf depends on the services and management experience of its executive officers and business leaders who have substantial experience and expertise in vf’s business the unexpected loss of services of one or more of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on vf our future success also depends on our ability to recruit retain and engage our personnel sufficiently competition for experienced and wellqualified personnel is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 

vf’s directtoconsumer business includes risks that could have an adverse effect on its results of operations 

vf sells merchandise directtoconsumer through vfoperated stores and ecommerce sites its directtoconsumer business is subject to numerous risks that could have a material adverse effect on its results risks include but are not limited to i us or international resellers purchasing merchandise and reselling it overseas outside vf’s control ii failure of the systems that operate the stores and websites and their related support systems including computer viruses theft of customer information privacy concerns telecommunication failures and electronic breakins and similar disruptions iii credit card fraud and iv risks related to vf’s directtoconsumer distribution centers and processes risks specific to vf’s ecommerce business also include i diversion of sales from vf stores or wholesale customers ii difficulty in recreating the instore experience through direct channels iii liability for online content iv changing patterns of consumer behavior and v intense competition from online retailers vf’s failure to successfully respond to these risks might adversely affect sales in its ecommerce business as well as damage its reputation and brands 

our vfoperated stores and ecommerce business require substantial fixed investments in equipment and leasehold improvements information systems inventory and personnel we have entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space due to the high fixedcost structure associated with our directtoconsumer operations a decline in sales or the closure of or poor performance of individual or multiple stores 

 

could result in significant lease termination costs writeoffs of equipment and leasehold improvements and employeerelated costs 

vf’s net sales depend on the volume of traffic to its stores and the availability of suitable lease space 

a growing portion of our revenues are directtoconsumer sales through vfoperated stores in order to generate customer traffic we locate many of our stores in prominent locations within successful retail shopping centers or in fashionable shopping districts our stores benefit from the ability of the retail center and other attractions in an area to generate consumer traffic in the vicinity of our stores part of our future growth is significantly dependent on our ability to operate stores in desirable locations with capital investment and lease costs providing the opportunity to earn a reasonable return we cannot control the development of new shopping centers or districts the availability or cost of appropriate locations within existing or new shopping centers or districts competition with other retailers for prominent locations or the success of individual shopping centers or districts further if we are unable to renew or replace our existing store leases or enter into leases for new stores on favorable terms or if we violate the terms of our current leases our growth and profitability could be harmed all of these factors may impact our ability to meet our growth targets and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

vf may be unable to protect its trademarks and other intellectual property rights 

vf’s trademarks and other intellectual property rights are important to its success and its competitive position vf is susceptible to others copying its products and infringing its intellectual property rights especially with the shift in product mix to higher priced brands and innovative new products in recent years some of vf’s brands such as the north face ®  timberland ®  vans ®  jansport ®  dickies ®  wrangler ®  and lee ®  enjoy significant worldwide consumer recognition and the higher pricing of those products creates additional risk of counterfeiting and infringement 

vf’s trademarks trade names patents trade secrets and other intellectual property are important to vf’s success counterfeiting of vf’s products or infringement on its intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our brands and adversely affect vf’s revenues actions we have taken to establish and protect vf’s intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent copying of its products by others or to prevent others from seeking to invalidate its trademarks or block sales of vf’s products as a violation of the trademarks and intellectual property rights of others in addition unilateral actions in the us or other countries including changes to or the repeal of laws recognizing trademark or other intellectual property rights could have an impact on vf’s ability to enforce those rights 

the value of vf’s intellectual property could diminish if others assert rights in or ownership of trademarks and other intellectual property rights of vf or trademarks that are similar to vf’s trademarks or trademarks that vf licenses from others we may be unable to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction in some cases there may be trademark owners who have prior rights to vf’s trademarks because the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the us in other cases there may be holders who have prior rights to similar trademarks 

vf corporation fiscal 2019 form 10k 15 

there have been and there may in the future be opposition and cancellation proceedings from time to time with respect to some of vfs intellectual property rights in some cases litigation may be necessary to protect or enforce our trademarks and other intellectual property rights furthermore third parties may assert intellectual property claims against us and we may be subject to liability required to enter into costly license agreements if available at all required to rebrand our products andor prevented from selling some of our products if third parties successfully oppose or challenge our trademarks or successfully claim that we infringe misappropriate or otherwise violate their trademarks copyrights patents or other intellectual property rights bringing or defending any such claim regardless or merit and whether successful or unsuccessful could be expensive and timeconsuming and have a negative effect on vfs business reputation results of operations and financial condition 

vf is subject to the risk that its licensees may not generate expected sales or maintain the value of vf’s brands 

during fiscal 2019  959 million  of vf’s revenues were derived from licensing royalties although vf generally has significant control over its licensees’ products and advertising we rely on our licensees for among other things operational and financial controls over their businesses failure of our licensees to successfully market licensed products or our inability to replace existing licensees if necessary could adversely affect vf’s revenues both directly from reduced royalties received and indirectly from reduced sales of our other products risks are also associated with a licensee’s ability to 

 in addition vf relies on its licensees to help preserve the value of its brands although we attempt to protect vf’s brands through approval rights over design production processes quality packaging merchandising distribution advertising and promotion of our licensed products we cannot completely control the use of licensed vf brands by our licensees the misuse of a brand by a licensee including through the marketing or products under one of our brand names that do not meet our quality standards could have a material adverse effect on that brand and on vf 

if vf encounters problems with its distribution system vf’s ability to deliver its products to the market could be adversely affected 

vf relies on owned or independentlyoperated distribution facilities to warehouse and ship product to its customers vf’s distribution system includes computercontrolled and automated equipment which may be subject to a number of risks related to security or computer viruses the proper operation of software and hardware power interruptions or other system failures because substantially all of vf’s products are distributed from a relatively small number of locations vf’s operations could also be interrupted by earthquakes floods fires or other natural disasters affecting its distribution centers we maintain business interruption insurance but it may not adequately protect vf from the adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in vf’s distribution facilities such as the longterm loss of 

 

customers or an erosion of brand image in addition vf’s distribution capacity is dependent on the timely performance of services by third parties including the transportation of product to and from its distribution facilities if we encounter problems with our distribution system our ability to meet customer expectations manage inventory complete sales and achieve operating efficiencies could be materially adversely affected 

volatility in securities markets interest rates and other economic factors could substantially increase vf’s defined benefit pension costs 

vf currently has obligations under its defined benefit pension plans the funded status of the pension plans is dependent on many factors including returns on investment assets and the discount rate used to determine pension obligations unfavorable impacts from returns on plan assets decreases in discount rates changes in plan demographics or revisions in the applicable laws or regulations could materially change the timing and amount of pension funding requirements which could reduce cash available for vf’s business 

vf’s operating performance also may be negatively impacted by the amount of expense recorded for its pension plans pension expense is calculated using actuarial valuations that incorporate assumptions and estimates about financial market economic and demographic conditions differences between estimated and actual results give rise to gains and losses that are deferred and amortized as part of future pension expense which can create volatility that adversely impacts vf’s future operating results 

the relocation of our global headquarters the north face ®  jansport ®  smartwool ®  altra ®  and eagle creek ®  brands and vf’s global innovation center for technical fabrics and digital lab could adversely affect our operations operating results and financial condition as we may experience disruptions to our business and incur additional costs in connection with the relocation 

we announced on august 13 2018 the relocation of our global headquarters to the metro denver area which will also serve as the home for the north face ®  jansport ®  smartwool ®  altra ®  and eagle creek ®  brands the “relocating brands” and vf’s global innovation center for technical fabrics and digital lab the “innovation center and lab” the process of moving our headquarters the relocating brands and the innovation center and lab is inherently complex and not part of our daytoday operations the relocation process could cause significant disruption to our operations cause the temporary diversion of management resources and result in the loss of key employees who have substantial experience and expertise in our business all of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations operating results and financial condition the need to replace company personnel who do not relocate train new employees and transition company operating knowledge may cause disruptions in our business while we have implemented a transition plan to provide for the move of our global headquarters the relocating brands and the innovation center and lab including relocation benefits for employees who may be transferring and severance and retention benefits for employees who will not be continuing with the company after the move we may encounter difficulties retaining employees who elect to transfer and attracting new talent in the denver area to replace our employees who are unwilling to relocate we may also experience difficulties in retaining employees who will remain in greensboro during the transition period and who we are relying on to facilitate the transition of operating knowledge in addition we may incur additional costs for 

16          vf corporation fiscal 2019 form 10k 

duplication in staff as we effect the transition we can give no assurance that the relocation will be completed as planned or within the expected timeframe in addition the relocation may involve significant additional costs to us and the expected benefits of the move may not be fully realized due to associated disruption to our operations and personnel 

we may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits we expect to achieve from the spinoff 

on may 22 2019 we completed the spinoff of our jeans business kontoor brands inc kontoor brands although we believe that the spinoff will enhance our longterm value we may not be able to achieve some or all of the anticipated benefits from the separation of our businesses and the spinoff may adversely affect our business separating the businesses resulted in two independent publicly traded companies each of which is now a smaller less diversified and more narrowly focused business than before the spinoff which makes us more vulnerable to changing market and economic conditions additionally a potential loss of synergies from separating the businesses could negatively impact the balance sheet profit margins or earnings of both businesses and the combined value of the common stock of the two publicly traded companies may not be equal to or greater than the value of vf common stock had the spinoff not occurred if we fail to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve as a result of the spinoff or do not achieve them in the time we expect our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

the kontoor brands spinoff could result in substantial tax liability to us and our stockholders 

we received opinions of tax advisors substantially to the effect that for us federal income tax purposes the spinoff and certain related transactions qualify for taxfree treatment under certain sections of the internal revenue code however if the factual assumptions or representations made by us in connection with the delivery of the opinions are inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect including those relating to the past and future conduct of our business we will not be able to rely on the opinions furthermore the opinions are not binding on the irs or the courts if notwithstanding receipt of the opinions the spinoff transaction and certain related transactions are determined to be taxable we would be subject to a substantial tax liability in addition if the spin 

 

off transaction is taxable each holder of our common stock who received shares of kontoor brands in connection with the spinoff would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares received 

even if the spinoff otherwise qualifies as a taxfree transaction the distribution would be taxable to us but not to our stockholders in certain circumstances if future significant acquisitions of our stock or the stock of kontoor brands are deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that included the spinoff in this event the resulting tax liability could be substantial in connection with the spinoff we entered into a tax matters agreement with kontoor brands pursuant to which kontoor brands agreed to not enter into any transaction that could cause any portion of the spinoff to be taxable to us without our consent and to indemnify us for any tax liability resulting from any such transaction in addition these potential tax liabilities may discourage delay or prevent a change of control of us 

certain directors who serve on our board of directors also serve as directors of kontoor brands and ownership of shares of common stock of kontoor brands following the spinoff by our directors and executive officers may create or appear to create conflicts of interest 

certain of our directors who serve on our board of directors currently serve on the board of directors of kontoor brands this may create or appear to create conflicts of interest when our or kontoor brands management and directors face decisions that could have different implications for us and kontoor brands including the resolution of any dispute regarding the terms of the agreements governing the spinoff and the relationship between us and kontoor brands after the spinoff or any other commercial agreements entered into in the future between us and kontoor brands 

most of our executive officers and nonemployee directors currently own shares of the common stock of kontoor brands the continued ownership of such common stock by our directors and executive officers following the spinoff creates or may create the appearance of a conflict of interest when these directors and executive officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for us and kontoor brands

year ended march 2019  compared to twelve months ended march 2018 unaudited 

vf reported a 12  increase in revenues in 2019  the 2019  results were driven by organic growth in the active outdoor and work segments continued strength in our directtoconsumer and international businesses and contributions from acquisitions the increases were partially offset by an unfavorable impact from foreign currency lower revenues due to dispositions and declines in the jeans segment international sales grew in every region in 2019  

 

year ended december 2017  compared to year ended december 2016   

vf reported a 7 increase in revenues in 2017  the 2017  results were driven by increases in the active and outdoor segments and continued strength in our directtoconsumer and international businesses the increase was also attributable to growth in the work segment which included a 2472 million contribution from the williamsondickie acquisition which closed on october 2 2017 these increases were offset by declines in the jeans segment international sales grew in every region in 2017  

additional details on revenues are provided in the section titled “information by reportable segment” 

the following table presents the percentage relationship to net revenues for components of the consolidated statements of income 



year ended march 2019  compared to twelve months ended march 2018 unaudited 

  

gross margin increased 10 basis points to 507  in 2019  compared to 506  in 2018  gross margin in 2019  was positively impacted by a mixshift to higher margin businesses and increased pricing partially offset by 459 million of costs related to the acquisition integration and separation of businesses and costs related to the relocation of our global headquarters and certain brands to denver colorado 

selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased 40 basis points in 2019  compared to 2018  this increase is primarily due to 1867 million of expenses related to the acquisition integration and separation of businesses and relocation of our global headquarters and certain brands to denver colorado the increase is also due to continued investments in our key strategic growth initiatives these costs were partially offset by leverage of operating expenses on higher revenues 

in 2019  operating margin decreased 30 basis points to 121  from 124  in 2018  primarily due to the items described above 

net interest expense decreased 14 million to 854 million in 2019  the decrease in net interest expense was due to higher 

 

international bank balances in high yielding currencies and the payoff of the 2500 million of 595 fixedrate notes on november 1 2017 which was partially offset by higher interest rates on increased levels of shortterm borrowings 

outstanding interestbearing debt averaged 34 billion for both 2019  and 2018  with shortterm borrowings representing 353 and 309 of average debt outstanding for the respective years the weighted average interest rates on outstanding debt were 31 in 2019  and 29 in 2018  

other income expense net primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses the funding fee charged on the sale of our trade receivables other components of net periodic pension cost excluding the service cost component and nonoperating gains and losses other income expense netted to 630 million  and 18 million  in 2019  and 2018  respectively included in other income expense net in 2019  is the loss on sale of the reef ®  brand business of 144 million and loss on sale of 224 million related to the divestiture of the van moer business 

the effective income tax rate was 176 in 2019  compared to 466 in 2018  the effective income tax rate is substantially lower in 2019  when compared to 2018  primarily due to discrete tax expense 

24          vf corporation fiscal 2019 form 10k 

associated with the tax act in december 2017 vf recognized a provisional charge of approximately 4655 million to reflect the impacts resulting from the tax act primarily comprised of approximately 5124 million related to the transition tax and approximately 895 million of tax benefits related to revaluing us deferred tax assets and liabilities using the new us corporate tax rate of 21 other provisional charges of 426 million were primarily related to us federal and state tax on foreign income and dividends and establishing a deferred tax liability for foreign withholding taxes as the company is not asserting indefinite reinvestment on shortterm liquid assets of certain foreign subsidiaries all other foreign earnings including basis differences of certain foreign subsidiaries continue to be considered indefinitely reinvested 

the 2019  effective income tax rate included a net discrete tax expense of 189 million which included 373 million net tax expense related to adjustments to provisional amounts recorded in 2017 under the tax act 319 million of tax benefit related to stock compensation 143 million of net tax expense related to unrecognized tax benefits and interest 19 million of tax benefit related to adjustments of previously recorded amounts based on proposed regulations and 12 million of tax expense related to adjustments to previously recognized state income tax credits the 189 million net discrete tax expense in 2019 increased the effective income tax rate by 13 compared to an unfavorable 294 impact of discrete items for 2018 excluding discrete items the effective tax rate during 2019 decreased by approximately 09 primarily due to a lower us corporate income tax rate that was effective beginning january 1 2018 the international effective tax rate was 116 for 2019 

as a result of the above income from continuing operations in 2019  was 13 billion   314  per diluted share compared to 08 billion   192  per diluted share in 2018  

refer to additional discussion in the “information by reportable segment” section below 

year ended december 2017  compared to year ended december 2016 

gross margin improved 120 basis points to 505  in 2017  compared to 493  in 2016  reflecting a 180 basis point benefit from pricing a mixshift toward higher margin businesses and lower restructuring costs which was partially offset by an unfavorable 60 basis point impact from foreign currency 

selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased 230 basis points in 2017  compared to 2016  this increase is primarily due to investments in our key growth priorities which include directtoconsumer product innovation demand creation and technology initiatives the increases were partially offset by lower restructuring costs in 2017  

in 2017  operating margin decreased 40 basis points to 128  from 132  in 2016 in addition to the items described above the operating margin decrease was partially offset by a 70 basis point increase from goodwill and intangible asset impairments in 2016  that did not recur in 2017  

net interest expense increased 03 million to 859 million in 2017  the increase in net interest expense was due to higher interest rates on shortterm borrowings and higher interest on longterm debt balances due to a full year of interest on the €850 million eurodenominated 0625 fixedrate notes issued in september 2016 which were partially offset by the payoff of the 2500 million of 595 fixedrate notes on november 1 2017 and an increase in international shortterm investment rates 

 

outstanding interestbearing debt averaged 32 billion for 2017  compared to 26 billion for 2016  with shortterm borrowings representing 27 and 37 of average debt outstanding for the respective years the weighted average interest rates on outstanding debt were 31 in 2017  and 35 in 2016 as the impact of the issuance of €850 million eurodenominated 0625 fixedrate notes in september of 2016 was offset by higher shortterm debt rates 

other income expense net primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses the funding fee charged on the sale of our trade receivables other components of net periodic pension cost excluding the service cost component and nonoperating gains and losses other income expense netted to 107 million  and 852 million  in 2017  and 2016  respectively a pension settlement charge of 509 million was included in 2016 which did not recur in 2017 

the effective income tax rate was 491 in 2017  compared to 160 in 2016  the effective income tax rate is substantially higher in 2017  when compared to 2016  primarily due to discrete tax expense associated with the tax act the tax act reduces the federal tax rate on us earnings to 21 and moves from a global taxation regime to a modified territorial regime as part of the legislation us companies are required to pay a tax on historical earnings generated offshore that have not been repatriated to the us additionally revaluation of deferred tax asset and liability positions at the lower federal base rate of 21 is also required the transitional impact of the tax act resulted in a provisional net charge of 4655 million or 115 per share during the three months ended december 2017  this amount which is included in the income taxes line item in the consolidated statements of income is primarily comprised of approximately 5124 million related to the transition tax and approximately 895 million tax benefit related to revaluing us deferred tax assets and liabilities using the new us corporate tax rate of 21 other provisional charges of 426 million were primarily related to us federal and state tax on foreign income and dividends and establishing a deferred tax liability for foreign withholding taxes as the company is not asserting indefinite reinvestment on shortterm liquid assets of certain foreign subsidiaries all other foreign earnings including basis differences of certain foreign subsidiaries continue to be considered indefinitely reinvested 

the 2017  effective income tax rate included a net discrete tax expense of 4389 million which included the provisional net charge of 4655 million related to the tax act 252 million of tax benefits related to stock compensation 29 million of net tax benefit related to the realization of previously unrecognized tax benefits and interest and 19 million of discrete tax expense related to the effects of tax rate changes exclusive of the tax act the 4389 million net discrete tax expense in 2017  increased the effective income tax rate by 310 compared to a favorable 34 impact of discrete items in 2016  without discrete items the effective tax rate during 2017  decreased by approximately 13 primarily due to the negative tax impact related to the 2016  goodwill impairment the international effective tax rate was 131 and 109 for 2017  and 2016  respectively 

as a result of the above income from continuing operations in 2017  was 07 billion   179  per diluted share compared to 11 billion   256  per diluted share in 2016

selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased 190 basis points during the three months ended march 2018  compared to the 2017  period the increase was due to expenses related to the acquisition and integration of businesses and higher investments in our key growth priorities which include demand creation customer fulfillment directtoconsumer and product innovation higher compensation costs also impacted the three months ended march 2018  

net interest expense increased 10 million during the three months ended march 2018  compared to the 2017  period this increase was due to higher levels of shortterm borrowings at higher interest rates compared to 2017  which was partially offset by lower interest on longterm debt due to the payoff of the 2500 million of 595 fixedrate notes on november 1 2017 total outstanding debt averaged 32 billion in the three months ended march 2018  and 26 billion in the same period in 2017  with weighted average interest rates of 29 and 36 respectively 

the effective income tax rate for the three months ended march 2018  was 112 compared to 208 in the three months ended 

 

march 2017  the three months ended march 2018  included a net discrete tax benefit of 161 million which included a 121 million tax benefit related to stock compensation a 73 million net tax benefit related to the realization of previously unrecognized tax benefits and interest an 88 million tax expense related to the change of a prior estimate of taxes payable and a 51 million net tax benefit related to adjustments to provisional amounts recorded in 2017 under the tax act the 161 million net discrete tax benefit in the three months ended march 2018  reduced the effective income tax rate by 55 compared to a favorable 04 impact of discrete items in the three months ended march 2017  without discrete items the effective income tax rate for the three months ended march 2018  decreased by 45 compared with the estimated annual effective tax rate applied to the three months ended march 2017  primarily due to a higher percentage of income in lower tax rate jurisdictions partially offset by an unfavorable impact from the tax act 

as a result of the above net income in the three months ended march 2018  was 2612 million 065 per share compared to 2133 million 051 per share in the 2017  period

the following discussion refers to significant changes in balances at march 2018  compared to december 2017  





the financial condition of vf is reflected in the following 



the increase in the current ratio at march 2019 compared to march 2018 was primarily due to a net decrease in current liabilities driven by lower shortterm borrowings and a net increase in current assets driven by higher accounts receivable balances as discussed in the balance sheets section above the decrease in the current ratio at march 2018 compared to december 2017 was primarily driven by the increase in shortterm borrowings 

for the ratio of debt to total capital debt is defined as shortterm and longterm borrowings and total capital is defined as debt plus stockholders’ equity the decrease in the debt to total capital ratio at march 2019  compared to march 2018  was attributed to the increase in stockholders equity which was driven by net income and stockbased compensation activity partially offset by payments of dividends and purchases of treasury stock the 

 

decrease in the debt to total capital ratio at march 2019 compared to march 2018 was also due to the decrease in shortterm borrowings as discussed in the balance sheets section above the increase in the debt to total capital ratio at march 2018 compared to december 2017 was due to the increase in shortterm borrowings as discussed in the balance sheets section above 

vf’s primary source of liquidity is the strong annual cash flow from operating activities cash from operations is typically lower in the first half of the calendar year as inventory builds to support peak sales periods in the second half of the calendar year cash provided by operating activities in the second half of the calendar year is substantially higher as inventories are sold and accounts receivable are collected additionally directtoconsumer sales are highest in the fourth quarter of the calendar year

in summary our cash flows were as follows 



the cash flows related to discontinued operations and heldforsale assets and liabilities have not been segregated and remain included in the major classes of assets and liabilities within the consolidated statements of cash flows accordingly the information in the table above and cash flow discussion below include the results of continuing and discontinued operations 

cash provided by operating activities 

cash flow related to operating activities is dependent on net income adjustments to net income and changes in working capital the increase in cash provided by operating activities in the year ended march 2019  compared to the twelve months ended march 2018 is primarily due to higher net income in the year ended march 2019 partially offset by an increase in net cash usage for working capital 

cash provided by operating activities remained relatively flat in the year ended december 2017  compared to the year ended december 2016  as lower net income was offset by working capital changes primarily related to an increase in accrued income tax payable resulting from the tax act 

cash used by investing activities 

the decrease in cash used by investing activities in the year ended march 2019  related primarily to 3204 million of net cash paid for acquisitions in the year ended march 2019 compared with 7405 million of net cash paid for acquisitions during the twelve months ended march 2018 investing activities also included 4303 million of proceeds received from the sale of businesses in the year ended march 2019 which is 2153 million higher than the proceeds received from the sales of businesses during the twelve months ended march 2018 capital expenditures increased 676 million compared to the twelve months ended march 2018 

vf’s investing activities in the year ended december 2017  related primarily to the williamsondickie acquisition of 7405 million net of cash received additionally the activities included 2150 million of proceeds from the sale of lsg which is 990 million higher than the proceeds received from the sale of the former contemporary brands segment in the year ended december 2016  capital expenditures of 1696 million and software purchases of 652 million offset the proceeds received capital expenditures decreased 63 million compared to the year ended december 2016  software purchases increased 210 million in the year ended december 2017  primarily due to system implementations and investments in our digital platform 

cash used by financing activities 

the increase in cash used by financing activities in the year ended march 2019  compared to the twelve months ended march 2018 was primarily due to a 21 billion net decrease in cash generated by shortterm borrowings driven by lower net borrowings during the year ended march 2019 compared to the twelve months ended march 2018 partially offset by a 8617 million decrease in treasury stock purchases and a 2486 million decrease in payments on longterm debt 

 

the increase in cash used by financing activities in the year ended december 2017  compared to the year ended december 2016  was driven by i no longterm debt borrowings in 2017  compared to 9518 million in proceeds during 2016 ii the 2500 million repayment of longterm debt and iii a 1999 million increase in purchases of treasury stock these increases were partially offset by the 11 billion increase in net cash generated by shortterm borrowings 

during the years ended march 2019  december 2017  and december 2016  vf purchased 19 million 222 million and 159 million shares respectively of its common stock in open market transactions under the share repurchase program authorized by vfs board of directors the cost was 1507 million 12 billion and 10 billion with an average price per share of 8062  5404 and 6280 in the years ended march 2019  december 2017  and december 2016  respectively 

as of the end of fiscal 2019 the company had 38 billion remaining for future repurchases under its share repurchase program vf will continue to evaluate its use of capital giving first priority to business acquisitions and then to direct shareholder return in the form of dividends and share repurchases 

vf relies on continued strong cash generation to finance its ongoing operations in addition vf has significant liquidity from its available cash balances and credit facilities in december 2018 vf entered into a 225 billion senior unsecured revolving line of credit the “global credit facility” that expires in december 2023 the global credit facility replaced vfs 225 billion revolving facility which was scheduled to expire in april 2020 vf may request an unlimited number of one year extensions so long as each extension does not cause the remaining life of the global credit facility to exceed five years subject to stated terms and conditions the global credit facility may be used to borrow funds in both us dollar and certain nonus dollar currencies and has a 500 million letter of credit sublimit in addition the global credit facility supports vf’s us commercial paper program for shortterm seasonal working capital requirements and general corporate purposes including share repurchases and acquisitions outstanding shortterm balances may vary from period to period depending on the level of corporate requirements borrowings under the global credit facility are priced at a credit spread of 810 basis points over the appropriate libor benchmark for each currency vf is also required to pay a facility fee to the lenders currently equal to 65 basis points of the committed amount of the facility the credit spread and facility fee are subject to adjustment based on vf’s credit ratings 

vf has a commercial paper program that allows for borrowings up to 225 billion to the extent that it has borrowing capacity under the global credit facility commercial paper borrowings and standby letters of credit issued as of march 2019  were 6500 

42          vf corporation fiscal 2019 form 10k 

million and 153 million respectively leaving approximately 16 billion available for borrowing against the global credit facility at march 2019  

vf has 1795 million of international lines of credit with various banks which are uncommitted and may be terminated at any time by either vf or the banks total outstanding balances under these arrangements were 151 million 251 million and 244 million at march 2019  march 2018 and december 2017  respectively borrowings under these arrangements had a weighted average interest rate of 246 120 and 99 at march 2019  march 2018 and december 2017  respectively excluding accepted letters of credit which are noninterest bearing to vf the interestbearing borrowings include shortterm borrowings in argentina 

vf repaid 2500 million of 595 fixedrate notes on november 1 2017 using a combination of operating cash flows and commercial paper borrowings 

vf’s favorable credit agency ratings allow for access to additional liquidity at competitive rates at the end of march 2019  vf’s longterm debt ratings were ‘a’ by standard  poor’s ratings services and ‘a3’ by moody’s investors service and commercial paper ratings by those rating agencies were ‘a1’ and ‘prime2’ respectively 

none of vf’s longterm debt agreements contain acceleration of maturity clauses based solely on changes in credit ratings however if there were a change in control of vf and as a result of the change in control the 2021 2023 and 2037 notes were rated 

 

below investment grade by recognized rating agencies vf would be obligated to repurchase the notes at 101 of the aggregate principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest 

cash dividends totaled 194 per share in the year ended march 2019  as compared to 172 and 153 in the years ended december 2017  and 2016  respectively the dividend payout ratio was 617 of diluted earnings per share in the year ended march 2019  as compared to 962 and 599 in the years ended december 2017  and 2016  respectively the company has declared a dividend of 051 per share that is payable in the first quarter of fiscal 2020  the company intends to reduce its quarterly dividend following the spinoff of the jeans business in a manner that results in vf paying an annual dividend with a longterm targeted payout ratio of 50 to 55 

on may 22 2019 vf completed the spinoff of its jeans business with the new company now operating as an independent publicly traded company under the name kontoor brands inc kontoor brands the spinoff is effected through a distribution to vf shareholders of one share of kontoor brands common stock for every seven shares of vf common stock held on the record date of may 10 2019 in connection with the spinoff kontoor brands transferred net proceeds of approximately 10 billion  to vf and its subsidiaries from its new debt issuance which vf intends to use to pay off its short term borrowings in addition vf expects an increase of approximately 150 million in capital expenditures during fiscal 2020 driven by infrastructure investments

in summary our cash flows were as follows 



the cash flows related to discontinued operations have not been segregated and are included in the consolidated statements of cash flows accordingly the information in the table above and cash flow discussion below include the results of continuing and discontinued operations 

cash used by operating activities 

cash flow related to operating activities is dependent on net income adjustments to net income and changes in working capital the increase in cash used by operating activities in the three months ended march 2018 is primarily due to an increase in net cash usage from working capital driven by the timing of payments and cash collections partially offset by higher net income in the three months ended march 2018 

cash used by investing activities 

the decrease in cash used by investing activities in the three months ended march 2018 was primarily due to proceeds from the sale of property plant and equipment of 208 million which was partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures of 135 million compared to the 2017 period 

 

cash provided used by financing activities 

the increase in cash provided by financing activities during the three months ended march 2018 was driven by a 5338 million increase in net cash generated by shortterm borrowings and a 1880 million decline in treasury stock purchases 

during the three months ended march 2018 vf purchased 34 million shares of its common stock in open market transactions at a total cost of 2503 million average price per share of 7446 under the share repurchase program authorized by vf’s board of directors in 2017 during the three months ended march 2017 vf purchased 82 million shares of its common stock in open market transactions at a total cost of 4383 million average price per share of 5332 as of the end of march 2018 the company had 40 billion remaining for future repurchases under its current share repurchase program

following is a summary of vf’s contractual obligations and commercial commitments at the end of march 2019  that will require the use of funds 





 

vf had other financial commitments at the end of fiscal 2019  that are not included in the above table but may require the use of funds under certain circumstances 



 

management believes that vf’s cash balances and funds provided by operating activities as well as its global credit facility additional borrowing capacity and access to capital markets taken as a whole provide i adequate liquidity to meet all of its current and longterm obligations when due ii adequate liquidity to fund capital expenditures and to maintain the planned dividend payout rate and iii flexibility to meet investment opportunities that may arise 

vf does not participate in transactions with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships established to facilitate offbalance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes 

44          vf corporation fiscal 2019 form 10k 



vf is exposed to risks in the ordinary course of business management regularly assesses and manages exposures to these risks through operating and financing activities and when appropriate by i taking advantage of natural hedges within vf ii purchasing insurance from commercial carriers or iii using derivative financial instruments some potential risks are discussed below 

insured risks 

vf is selfinsured for a significant portion of its employee medical workers’ compensation vehicle and general liability exposures vf purchases insurance from highlyrated commercial carriers to cover other risks including directors and officers property and umbrella and to establish stoploss limits on selfinsurance arrangements 

cash and equivalents risks 

vf had 5430 million  of cash and equivalents at the end of fiscal 2019  management continually monitors the credit ratings of the financial institutions with whom vf conducts business similarly management monitors the credit quality of cash equivalents 

defined benefit pension plan risks 

at the end of fiscal 2019  vf’s defined benefit pension plans were underfunded by a net total of 678 million the underfunded status includes a 1184 million liability related to our unfunded us nonqualified defined benefit plan 629 million of net liabilities related to our nonus defined benefit plans and a 1135 million asset related to our us qualified defined benefit plan vf has made significant cash contributions in recent years to improve the funded status of its plans vf will continue to evaluate the funded status and future funding requirements of these plans which depends in part on the future performance of the plans’ investment portfolios management believes that vf has sufficient liquidity to make any required contributions to the pension plans in future years 

vf’s reported earnings are subject to risks due to the volatility of its pension expense which has ranged in recent years from 348 million in the year ended december 2017 to 1130 million in the year ended december 2016 including the 509 million settlement charge discussed below these fluctuations are primarily due to varying amounts of actuarial gains and losses that are deferred and amortized to future years’ expense the assumptions that impact actuarial gains and losses include the rate of return on investments held by the pension plans the discount rate used to value participant liabilities and demographic characteristics of the participants 

in fiscal 2019 vf approved a freeze of all future benefit accruals under the us qualified defined benefit pension plan and supplemental defined benefit pension plan effective december 31 2018 during the year ended december 2016 vf took an additional step in managing pension risk by offering former employees in the us qualified plan a onetime option to receive a distribution of their deferred vested benefits pursuant to which the plan paid 1971 million in lumpsum distributions to settle 2247 million of projected benefit obligations the company recorded 509 million in settlement charges during the year ended december 2016 to recognize the related deferred actuarial losses in accumulated other comprehensive income loss no additional funding of the pension plan was required as all distributions were 

 

paid out of existing plan assets and the plan’s funded status remained materially unchanged as a result of this offer however assuming other key assumptions remain unchanged pension expense will decrease in future years due to lower amortization of net deferred actuarial losses refer to note 15 to the consolidated financial statements and the “critical accounting policies and estimates” section below 

vf has taken a series of steps to manage the risk and volatility in the pension plans and their impact on the financial statements in 2005 vf’s us defined benefit plans were closed to new entrants which did not affect the benefits of existing plan participants at that date or their accrual of future benefits in more recent years the investment strategy of the us qualified plan has been revised to define dynamic asset allocation targets that are dependent upon changes in the plan’s funded status capital market expectations and risk tolerance additionally vf completed the onetime lumpsum offering noted above during the year ended december 2016 which reduced the number of plan participants in the us qualified plan by 23 also in fiscal 2019 vf approved a freeze of all future benefit accruals under the us qualified defined benefit pension plan and supplemental defined benefit pension plan effective december 31 2018 management will continue to evaluate actions that may help to reduce vf’s risks related to its defined benefit plans 

interest rate risks 

vf limits the risk of interest rate fluctuations by managing the mix of fixed and variable interest rate debt in addition vf may use derivative financial instruments to manage risk since all of vf’s longterm debt has fixed interest rates the exposure relates to changes in interest rates on variable rate shortterm borrowings which averaged approximately 12 billion during fiscal 2019  however any change in interest rates would also affect interest income earned on vf’s cash equivalents based on the average amount of variable rate borrowings and cash equivalents during fiscal 2019  the effect of a hypothetical 1 increase in interest rates would be a decrease in reported net income of approximately 88 million 

foreign currency exchange rate risks 

vf is a global enterprise subject to the risk of foreign currency fluctuations approximately 41  of vf’s revenues in the year ended march 2019  were generated in international markets most of vf’s foreign businesses operate in functional currencies other than the us dollar in periods where the us dollar strengthens relative to the euro or other foreign currencies where vf has operations there is a negative impact on vf’s operating results upon translation of those foreign operating results into the us dollar as discussed later in this section management hedges vf’s investments in certain foreign operations and foreign currency transactions 

the reported values of assets and liabilities in these foreign businesses are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for net advances to and investments in vf’s foreign businesses that are considered to be longterm the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on those longterm advances is deferred as a component of accumulated oci in stockholders’ equity the us dollar value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries fluctuates with changes in the underlying functional currencies on september 20 2016 vf issued €850 

vf corporation fiscal 2019 form 10k 45 

million of eurodenominated fixedrate notes which it has designated as a net investment hedge of vf’s investment in certain foreign operations because this debt qualified as a nonderivative hedging instrument foreign currency transaction gains or losses of the debt are deferred in the foreign currency translation and other component of accumulated oci as an offset to the foreign currency translation adjustments on the hedged investments any amounts deferred in accumulated oci will remain until the hedged investment is sold or substantially liquidated 

vf monitors net foreign currency market exposures and enters into derivative foreign currency contracts to hedge the effects of exchange rate fluctuations for a significant portion of forecasted foreign currency cash flows or specific foreign currency transactions relating to crossborder inventory purchases production costs product sales operating costs and intercompany royalty payments vf’s practice is to buy or sell foreign currency exchange contracts that cover up to 80 of foreign currency exposures for periods of up to 24 months currently vf uses only foreign exchange forward contracts but may use options or collars in the future this use of financial instruments allows management to reduce the overall exposure to risks from exchange rate fluctuations on vf’s cash flows and earnings since gains and losses on these contracts will offset losses and gains on the transactions being hedged 

for cash flow hedging contracts outstanding at the end of fiscal 2019  if there were a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates compared to rates at the end of fiscal 2019  it would result in a change in fair value of those contracts of approximately 245 million however any change in the fair value of the hedging contracts would be substantially offset by a change in the fair value of the underlying hedged exposure impacted by the currency rate changes 

 

counterparty risks 

vf is exposed to creditrelated losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to derivative hedging instruments to manage this risk we have established counterparty credit guidelines and only enter into derivative transactions with financial institutions that have ‘a minusa3’ investment grade credit ratings or better vf continually monitors the credit rating of and limits the amount hedged with each counterparty additionally management utilizes a portfolio of financial institutions to minimize exposure to potential counterparty defaults and adjusts positions as necessary vf also monitors counterparty risk for derivative contracts within the defined benefit pension plans 

commodity price risks 

vf is exposed to market risks for the pricing of cotton leather rubber wool and other materials which we either purchase directly or in a converted form such as fabric or shoe soles to manage risks of commodity price changes management negotiates prices in advance when possible vf has not historically managed commodity price exposures by using derivative instruments 

deferred compensation and related investment security risks 

vf has nonqualified deferred compensation plans in which liabilities to the plans’ participants are based on the market values of the participants’ selection of a hypothetical portfolio of investment funds vf invests in a portfolio of securities that substantially mirrors the participants’ investment selections the increases and decreases in deferred compensation liabilities are substantially offset by corresponding increases and decreases in the market value of vf’s investments resulting in an insignificant net exposure to operating results and financial position 



vf has chosen accounting policies that management believes are appropriate to accurately and fairly report vf’s operating results and financial position in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us vf applies these accounting policies in a consistent manner significant accounting policies are summarized in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

the application of these accounting policies requires that vf make estimates and assumptions about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses contingent assets and liabilities and related disclosures these estimates assumptions and judgments are based on historical experience current trends and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis because vf’s business cycle is relatively short ie from the date 

 

that inventory is received until that inventory is sold and the trade receivable is collected actual results related to most estimates are known within a few months after any balance sheet date in addition vf may retain outside specialists to assist in valuations of business acquisitions impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets equity compensation pension benefits and selfinsured liabilities if actual results ultimately differ from previous estimates the revisions are included in results of operations when the actual amounts become known 

vf believes the following accounting policies involve the most significant management estimates assumptions and judgments used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements or are the most sensitive to change from outside factors the application of these critical accounting policies and estimates is discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors 



vf’s inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value cost includes all material labor and overhead costs incurred to manufacture or purchase the finished goods overhead allocated to manufactured product is based on the normal capacity of plants and does not include amounts related to idle capacity or abnormal production inefficiencies vf performs a detailed review at each business unit at least quarterly of all inventories on the basis of 

 

individual styles or individual stylesizecolor stock keeping units to identify slow moving or excess products discontinued and tobediscontinued products and offquality merchandise this review matches inventory on hand plus current production and purchase commitments with current and expected future sales orders management performs an evaluation to estimate net realizable value using a systematic and consistent methodology of 

46          vf corporation fiscal 2019 form 10k 

forecasting future demand market conditions and selling prices less costs of disposal if the estimated net realizable value is less than cost vf provides an allowance to reflect the lower value of that inventory this methodology recognizes inventory exposures at the time such losses are evident rather than at the time goods are actually sold historically these estimates of future demand and selling prices have not varied significantly from actual results due to vf’s timely identification and ability to rapidly dispose of these distressed inventories 

 

existence of physical inventory is verified through periodic physical inventory counts and ongoing cycle counts at most locations throughout the year vf provides for estimated inventory losses that have likely occurred since the last physical inventory date historically physical inventory shrinkage has not been material 



vf allocates the purchase price of an acquired business to the fair values of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed with any excess purchase price recorded as goodwill vf evaluates fair value at acquisition using three valuation techniques  the replacement cost market and income methods  and weights the valuation methods based on what is most appropriate in the circumstances the process of assigning fair values particularly to acquired intangible assets is highly subjective 

fair value for acquired intangible assets is generally based on the present value of expected cash flows indefinitelived trademark or trade name intangible assets collectively referred to herein as “trademarks” represent individually acquired trademarks some of which are registered in multiple countries definitelived customer relationship intangible assets are based on the value of relationships with wholesale customers at the time of acquisition definitelived license intangible assets relate to vfs licensing contracts with customers goodwill represents the excess of cost of an acquired business over the fair value of net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired and is assigned at the reporting unit level 

vf’s depreciation policies for property plant and equipment reflect judgments on their estimated economic lives and residual value if any vf’s amortization policies for definitelived intangible assets reflect judgments on the estimated amounts and duration of future cash flows expected to be generated by those assets in evaluating the amortizable life for customer relationship intangible assets management considers historical attrition patterns for various groups of customers for licenserelated intangible assets management considers historical trends and anticipated license renewal periods 

testing of definitelived assets 

vf’s policy is to review property plant and equipment and definitelived intangible assets for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable vf tests for potential impairment at the asset or asset group level which is the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent vf measures recoverability of the carrying value of an asset or asset group by comparison to the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if the forecasted undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset are not expected to be adequate to recover the asset’s carrying value a fair value analysis must be performed and an impairment charge is recorded if there is an excess of the asset’s carrying value over its estimated fair value 

when testing property plant and equipment for potential impairment vf uses the incomebased discounted cash flow method using the estimated cash flows of the respective asset or 

 

asset group the estimated undiscounted cash flows of the asset or asset group through the end of its useful life are compared to its carrying value if the undiscounted cash flows of the asset or asset group exceed its carrying value there is no impairment charge if the undiscounted cash flows of the asset or asset group are less than its carrying value the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group is calculated based on the aftertax discounted cash flows using an appropriate weighted average cost of capital wacc and an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group and its carrying value 

when testing definitelived trademarks for potential impairment management uses the incomebased relieffromroyalty method under this method forecasted revenues for products sold with the trademark are assigned a royalty rate that would be charged to license the trademark in lieu of ownership and the estimated undiscounted cash flows of the trademark representing forecasted royalties avoided by owning the trademark are compared to its carrying value if the undiscounted cash flows of the trademark exceed its carrying value there is no impairment charge if the undiscounted cash flows of the trademark are less than its carrying value the estimated fair value of the trademark is calculated in a manner consistent with indefinitelived intangible assets discussed below and an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value of the trademark and its carrying value 

when testing customer relationship intangible assets for potential impairment management considers historical customer attrition rates and projected revenues and profitability related to customers that existed at acquisition management uses the multiperiod excess earnings method which is a specific application of the discounted cash flow method to value customer relationship assets under this method vf calculates the present value of the aftertax cash flows expected to be generated by the customer relationship asset after deducting contributory asset charges 

rock  republic ®  impairment analysis 

the rock  republic ® brand has an exclusive wholesale distribution and licensing arrangement with kohls corporation that covers all branded apparel accessories and other merchandise as of june 30 2018 vf performed a quantitative impairment analysis of the rock  republic ®  amortizing trademark intangible asset to determine if the carrying value was recoverable we determined this testing was necessary based on the expectation that certain customer contract terms would be modified management used the incomebased relieffromroyalty method and the contractual 4 royalty rate to calculate the pretax undiscounted future cash flows based on the analysis performed management concluded that the trademark intangible asset did not require further testing 

vf corporation fiscal 2019 form 10k 47 

as the undiscounted cash flows exceeded the carrying value of 490 million 

it is possible that vfs conclusion regarding the recoverability of the intangible asset could change in future periods as there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions used in the analysis as of june 30 2018 will prove to be accurate predictions of the future 

testing of indefinitelived assets and goodwill 

vf’s policy is to evaluate indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill for possible impairment as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of such assets may be below their carrying amount as part of its annual impairment testing vf may elect to assess qualitative factors as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform quantitative impairment testing if management’s assessment of these qualitative factors indicates that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset or reporting unit is less than its carrying value then no further testing is required otherwise the intangible asset or reporting unit must be quantitatively tested for impairment 

an indefinitelived intangible asset is quantitatively tested for possible impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value fair value of an indefinitelived trademark is based on an income approach using the relieffromroyalty method under this method forecasted revenues for products sold with the trademark are assigned a royalty rate that would be charged to license the trademark in lieu of ownership and the estimated fair value is calculated as the present value of those forecasted royalties avoided by owning the trademark the appropriate discount rate is based on the reporting unit’s wacc that considers market participant assumptions plus a spread that factors in the risk of the intangible asset the royalty rate is selected based on consideration of i royalty rates included in active license agreements if applicable ii royalty rates received by market participants in the apparel industry and iii the current performance of the reporting unit if the estimated fair value of the trademark intangible asset exceeds its carrying value there is no impairment charge if the estimated fair value of the trademark is less than its carrying value an impairment charge would be recognized for the difference 

goodwill is quantitatively evaluated for possible impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value reporting units are businesses with discrete financial information that is available and reviewed by segment management 

for goodwill impairment testing vf estimates the fair value of a reporting unit using both incomebased and marketbased valuation methods the incomebased approach is based on the reporting unit’s forecasted future cash flows that are discounted to present value using the reporting unit’s wacc as discussed above for the marketbased approach management uses both the guideline company and similar transaction methods the guideline company method analyzes market multiples of revenues and earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” for a group of comparable public companies the market multiples used in the valuation are based on the relative strengths and weaknesses of the reporting unit compared to the selected guideline companies under the similar transactions method valuation multiples are calculated utilizing actual 

 

transaction prices and revenueebitda data from target companies deemed similar to the reporting unit 

based on the range of estimated fair values developed from the income and marketbased methods vf determines the estimated fair value for the reporting unit if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value the goodwill is not impaired and no further review is required however if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value vf calculates the impairment loss as the difference between the carrying value of the reporting unit and the estimated fair value 

the incomebased fair value methodology requires management’s assumptions and judgments regarding economic conditions in the markets in which vf operates and conditions in the capital markets many of which are outside of management’s control at the reporting unit level fair value estimation requires management’s assumptions and judgments regarding the effects of overall economic conditions on the specific reporting unit along with assessment of the reporting unit’s strategies and forecasts of future cash flows forecasts of individual reporting unit cash flows involve management’s estimates and assumptions regarding 

 under the marketbased fair value methodology judgment is required in evaluating market multiples and recent transactions management believes that the assumptions used for its impairment tests are representative of those that would be used by market participants performing similar valuations of vf’s reporting units 

timberland reporting unit impairment analysis 

the historical timberland reporting unit included the timberland pro ®  brand and was included in the former outdoor  action sports segment in connection with the segment reporting changes in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 timberland pro was identified as a new reporting unit accordingly vf was required to evaluate whether there was any impairment at the historical timberland reporting unit and allocate to timberland pro a portion of the historical timberland reporting unit goodwill of 8446 million at the april 1 2018 assessment date 

management performed a quantitative impairment analysis and concluded that the estimated fair value of the historical timberland reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by a substantial amount and thus the goodwill was not impaired 

48          vf corporation fiscal 2019 form 10k 

management allocated 515 million of the historical timberland reporting unit goodwill balance to timberland pro based on estimated relative fair values the goodwill for the timberland pro reporting unit is included in the work reportable segment the remaining goodwill from the historical timberland reporting unit is included in the outdoor reportable segment 

management considered whether there were any triggering events that would require impairment testing for the new reporting units and determined that there were none 

jeanswear north america reporting unit impairment analysis 

the historical jeanswear north america reporting unit included the wrangler ®   riggs  brand and was included in the former jeanswear segment in connection with the segment reporting changes in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 wrangler riggs was identified as a new reporting unit accordingly vf was required to evaluate whether there was any impairment at the historical jeanswear north america reporting unit and allocate to wrangler riggs a portion of the historical jeanswear north america reporting unit goodwill of 1421 million at the april 1 2018 assessment date 

management performed a quantitative impairment analysis and concluded that the estimated fair value of the historical jeanswear north america reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by a substantial amount and thus the goodwill was not impaired 

management allocated 74 million of the historical jeanswear north america reporting unit goodwill balance to wrangler riggs based on estimated relative fair values the goodwill for the wrangler riggs reporting unit is included in the work reportable segment the remaining goodwill from the historical jeanswear north america reporting unit is included in the jeans reportable segment 

management considered whether there were any triggering events that would require impairment testing for the new reporting units and determined that there were none 

reef ®  impairment analysis 

in may 2018 management commenced a strategic assessment of the reef ®  brand which was considered a triggering event that required management to perform a quantitative impairment analysis of the goodwill and trademark intangible asset for the reef ®  reporting unit based on the analyses management concluded that the goodwill and trademark were not impaired for goodwill the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by 16 the estimated fair value of the trademark exceeded its carrying value by a significant amount 

the reef ®  brand acquired in 2005 sold surfinspired products including sandals shoes swimwear casual apparel and accessories for men women and children products were sold globally through specialty stores sporting goods chains department stores independent distributors and online as part of the 2009 annual impairment analyses vf recorded impairment charges of 311 million and 56 million related to the goodwill and trademark respectively the remaining carrying values of the goodwill and trademark at the may 26 2018 testing date were 483 million and 744 million respectively until its sale in october 2018 the reef ®  brand was included in the active reportable segment 

 

management’s revenue and profitability forecasts used in the reef ®  reporting unit and intangible asset valuations considered historical reef ®  performance strategic initiatives for the reef ®  reporting unit and industry trends assumptions used in the valuations were similar to those that would be used by market participants performing independent valuations of the business 

key assumptions developed by vf management and used in the quantitative analyses of the reef ®  reporting unit and trademark include 

 management made its estimates based on information available as of the date of our assessment using assumptions we believe market participants would use in performing an independent valuation of the business vf completed the sale of the reef ®  brand business on october 26 2018 

fiscal 2019  annual impairment testing 

management performed its annual goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment testing as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019  management performed a qualitative analysis for all reporting units and trademark intangible assets as discussed below in the “qualitative impairment analysis” section 

qualitative impairment analysis 

for all reporting units vf elected to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the goodwill and trademark intangible assets in those reporting units were impaired in this qualitative assessment vf considered relevant events and circumstances for each reporting unit including i current year results ii financial performance versus management’s annual and fiveyear strategic plans iii changes in the reporting unit carrying value since prior year iv industry and market conditions in which the reporting unit operates v macroeconomic conditions including discount rate changes and vi changes in products or services offered by the reporting unit if applicable performance in recent years was compared to forecasts included in prior valuations based on the results of the qualitative assessment vf concluded that it was not more likely than not that the carrying values of the goodwill and trademark intangible assets were greater than their fair values and that further quantitative testing was not necessary 

management’s use of estimates and assumptions 

management made its estimates based on information available as of the date of our assessment using assumptions we believe market participants would use in performing an independent valuation of the business it is possible that vf’s conclusions regarding impairment or recoverability of goodwill or intangible assets in any reporting unit could change in future periods there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions used in our goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing will prove to be accurate predictions of the future if for example i the 

vf corporation fiscal 2019 form 10k 49 

businesses do not perform as projected ii overall economic conditions in fiscal 2020 or future years vary from current assumptions including changes in discount rates iii business conditions or strategies for a specific reporting unit change from current assumptions including loss of major customers iv investors require higher rates of return on equity investments in the marketplace or v enterprise values of comparable publicly 

 

traded companies or actual sales transactions of comparable companies were to decline resulting in lower multiples of revenues and ebitda 

a future impairment charge for goodwill or intangible assets could have a material effect on vf’s consolidated financial position and results of operations 



vf uses a lattice optionpricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees and nonemployee members of the board of directors vf believes that a lattice model provides a refined estimate of the fair value of options because it can incorporate i historical option exercise patterns and multiple assumptions about future option exercise patterns for each of several groups of option holders and ii inputs that vary over time such as assumptions for interest rates and volatility management performs an annual review of all assumptions employed in the valuation of option grants and believes they are reflective of the outstanding options and underlying common stock and of groups of option participants the lattice valuation incorporates the assumptions listed in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements 

one of the critical assumptions in the valuation process is estimating the expected average life of the options before they are exercised for each option grant vf estimated the expected average life based on evaluations of the historical and expected 

 

option exercise patterns for each of the groups of option holders that have historically exhibited different option exercise patterns these evaluations included i voluntary stock option exercise patterns based on a combination of changes in the price of vf common stock and periods of time that options are outstanding before exercise and ii involuntary exercise patterns resulting from turnover retirement and death 

volatility is another critical assumption requiring judgment management bases its estimates of future volatility on a combination of implied and historical volatility implied volatility is based on shortterm 6 to 9 months publicly traded nearthemoney options on vf common stock vf measures historical volatility over a tenyear period corresponding to the contractual term of the options using daily stock prices management’s assumption for valuation purposes is that expected volatility starts at a level equal to the implied volatility and then transitions to the historical volatility over the remainder of the tenyear option term 



vf sponsors a qualified defined benefit pension plan covering most fulltime us employees hired before 2005 and an unfunded supplemental defined benefit pension plan us pension plans that provides benefits in excess of the limitations imposed by income tax regulations in fiscal 2019 vf approved a freeze of all future benefit accruals under the us qualified defined benefit pension plan and supplemental defined benefit pension plan effective december 31 2018 vf also sponsors certain nonus defined benefit pension plans the selection of actuarial assumptions for determining the projected pension benefit liabilities and annual pension expense is significant due to amounts involved and the long time period over which benefits are accrued and paid 

annually management reviews the principal economic actuarial assumptions summarized in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements and revises them as appropriate based on current rates and trends as of the valuation date vf also periodically reviews and revises as necessary other plan assumptions such as rates of compensation increases retirement termination disability and mortality vf believes the assumptions appropriately reflect the participants’ demographics and projected benefit obligations of the plans and result in the best estimate of the plans’ future experience actual results may vary from the actuarial assumptions used 

the below discussion of discount rate return on assets and mortality assumptions relates specifically to the us pension plans as they comprise approximately 91  of vf’s total defined benefit plan assets and approximately 88  of vf’s total projected benefit obligations of the combined us and international plans 

 

one of the critical assumptions used in the actuarial model is the discount rate which is used to estimate the present value of future cash outflows necessary to meet projected benefit obligations for the specific plan it is the estimated interest rate that vf could use to settle its projected benefit obligations at the valuation date the discount rate assumption is based on current market interest rates vf selects a discount rate for each of the us pension plans by matching high quality corporate bond yields to the timing of projected benefit payments to participants in each plan vf uses the population of us corporate bonds rated ‘aa’ by moody’s investors service or standard  poor’s ratings services vf excludes the highest and lowest yielding bonds from this population of approximately 1046 such bonds the bonds must be noncallablenonputable unless makewhole provisions exist each plan’s projected benefit payments are matched to current market interest rates over the expected payment period to calculate an associated present value a single equivalent discount rate is then determined that produces the same present value the resulting discount rate is reflective of both the current interest rate environment and the plan’s distinct liability characteristics vf believes that those ‘aa’ rated issues meet the “high quality” intent of the applicable accounting standards and that the fiscal 2019 discount rates of 398 for the us qualified defined benefit pension plan and 399 for the unfunded supplemental defined benefit plan appropriately reflect current market conditions and the longterm nature of projected benefit payments to participants in the us pension plans these higher discount rates compared with the rates of 366 for the us qualified defined benefit pension plan and 370 for the unfunded supplemental defined benefit plan at the end of december 2017 reflect the general increase in yields 

50          vf corporation fiscal 2019 form 10k 

of us government obligations and high quality corporate bonds during fiscal 2019 

vf utilizes the spot rate approach to measure service and interest costs under the spot rate approach the full yield curve is applied separately to cash flows for each projected benefit obligation service cost and interest cost for a more precise calculation 

another critical assumption of the actuarial model is the expected longterm rate of return on investments vf’s investment objective is to invest in a diversified portfolio of assets with an acceptable level of risk to maximize the longterm return while minimizing volatility in the value of plan assets relative to the value of plan liabilities these risks include market interest rate credit liquidity regulatory and foreign securities risks investment assets consist of cash equivalents us and international equity corporate and governmental fixedincome securities insurance contracts and alternative assets vf develops a projected rate of return for each of the investment asset classes based on many factors including historical and expected returns the estimated inflation rate the premium to be earned in excess of a riskfree return the premium for equity risk and the premium for longer duration fixedincome securities the weighted average projected longterm rates of return of the various assets held by the us qualified plan provide the basis for the expected longterm rate of return actuarial assumption vf’s rate of return assumption was 570 in the year ended march 2019 585 in the three months ended march 2018 and 600 in the years ended december 2017 and 2016 in recent years vf has altered the investment mix by i increasing the allocation to fixedincome investments and reducing the allocation to equity investments and ii increasing the allocation in equities to more international investments the changes in asset allocation are anticipated over time to reduce the yeartoyear variability of the us qualified plan’s funded status and resulting pension expense management monitors the plan’s asset allocation to balance risk with anticipated investment returns in a given year based on an evaluation of market conditions and projected market returns vf will be using a rate of return assumption of 570 for the us qualified defined benefit pension plan for fiscal 2020 

we consistently review all of our demographic assumptions as part of the normal management of our defined benefit plans and update these assumptions as appropriate the company performed a demographic assumptions study in 2017 and updated the assumptions as necessary in the year ended march 2019 valuations 

 

in 2014 the society of actuaries soa issued new mortality tables rp2014 and mortality improvement scales mp2014 which reflect longer life expectancies than the previous tables in 2017 the soa issued updated scales mp2017 which were adjusted for characteristics of our planspecific populations and other data where appropriate in developing our best estimate of the expected mortality rates of plan participants in the us pension plans management assessed the mortality assumption and concluded no change was needed for the year ended march 2019 

differences between actual results in a given year and the actuarially determined assumed results for that year eg investment performance discount rates and other assumptions do not affect that year’s pension expense but instead are deferred as unrecognized actuarial gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the consolidated balance sheet at the end of fiscal 2019 for all pension plans there were 3991 million  of pretax accumulated deferred actuarial losses plus 06 million  of pretax deferred prior service costs resulting in an aftertax amount of  2432 million  in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the march 2019 consolidated balance sheet these deferred losses will be amortized as a component of pension expense 

pension expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements was 397 million  in the year ended march 2019 46 million  in the three months ended march 2018  and 348 million  and 1130 million  in the years ended december 2017 and 2016 respectively pension expense for the year ended december 2016 was higher as it included a 509 million settlement charge resulting from 9400 participants accepting a onetime option to receive a distribution of their deferred vested benefits refer to note 15 the cost of pension benefits actually earned each year by covered active employees commonly called “service cost” was 224 million  in the year ended march 2019 59 million  in the three months ended march 2018  249 million  in the year ended december 2017 and 258 million  in the year ended december 2016 pension expense was higher in the year ended march 2019 compared to the year ended december 2017 due to settlement and curtailment charges in the year ended march 2019 discussed in note 15 and higher interest costs resulting from higher interest rates for the us pension plans partially offset by lower amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses looking forward vf expects pension income for the next 12 months of approximately 33 million as a result of lower amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses and lower services costs 

the sensitivity of changes in actuarial assumptions on fiscal 2019  pension expense and on projected benefit obligations related to the us defined benefit pension plan at the end of fiscal 2019  all other factors being equal is illustrated by the following 



as discussed in the “risk management” section above vf has taken a series of steps to reduce volatility in the pension plans and their impact on the financial statements on a longerterm basis vf believes the yeartoyear variability of the retirement benefit expense should decrease 

vf corporation fiscal 2019 form 10k 51 



as a global company vf is subject to income taxes and files income tax returns in over 100 us and foreign jurisdictions each year as discussed in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements vf has been granted a lower effective income tax rate on taxable earnings in certain foreign jurisdictions due to economic and political conditions tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change the company could be subject to changes in its tax rates the adoption of new us or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities vf makes an ongoing assessment to identify any significant exposure related to increases in tax rates in the jurisdictions in which vf operates 

in february 2015 the european union commission “eu” opened a state aid investigation into belgium’s rulings on january 11 2016 the eu announced its decision that these rulings were illegal and ordered that tax benefits granted under these rulings should be collected from the affected companies including vf on march 22 2016 the belgium government filed an appeal seeking annulment of the eu decision additionally on june 21 2016 vf europe bvba filed its own application for annulment of the eu decision on december 22 2016 belgium adopted a law which entitled the belgium tax authorities to issue tax assessments and demand timely payments from companies which benefited from the excess profits regime on january 10 2017 vf europe bvba received an assessment for €319 million tax and interest related to excess profits benefits received in prior years vf europe bvba remitted €319 million 339 million on january 13 2017 which was recorded as an income tax receivable in 2017 based on the expected success of the aforementioned requests for annulment an additional assessment of €31 million 38 million was received and paid in january 2018 on february 14 2019 the general court annulled the eu decision and on april 26 2019 the eu appealed the general court’s annulment both listed requests for annulment remain open and unresolved if this matter is adversely resolved these amounts will not be collected by vf 

the calculation of income tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations which are subject to legal interpretation and significant management judgment vf’s income tax returns are regularly examined by federal state and foreign tax authorities and those audits may result in proposed adjustments vf has reviewed all issues raised upon examination as well as any exposure for issues that may be raised in future examinations vf has evaluated these potential issues under the “morelikelythannot” standard of the accounting literature a tax position is recognized if it meets this standard and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized such judgments and estimates may change based on audit settlements court cases and interpretation of tax laws and regulations income tax expense could be materially affected to the extent vf prevails in a tax position or when the statute of limitations expires for a tax position for which a liability for unrecognized tax benefits or valuation allowances have been established or to the extent vf is required to pay amounts greater than the established liability for unrecognized tax benefits vf does not currently anticipate any material impact on earnings from the ultimate resolution of income tax uncertainties there are no accruals for general or unknown tax expenses 

vf has 2494 million of gross deferred income tax assets related to operating loss and capital loss carryforwards and 1783 million of valuation allowances against those assets realization of 

 

deferred tax assets related to operating loss and capital loss carryforwards is dependent on future taxable income in specific jurisdictions the amount and timing of which are uncertain and on possible changes in tax laws if management believes that vf will not be able to generate sufficient taxable income or capital gains to offset losses during the carryforward periods vf records valuation allowances to reduce those deferred tax assets to amounts expected to be ultimately realized if in a future period management determines that the amount of deferred tax assets to be realized differs from the net recorded amount vf would record an adjustment to income tax expense in that future period 

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted the tax act the tax act included a broad range of complex provisions impacting the taxation of multinational companies generally accounting for the impacts of newly enacted tax legislation is required to be completed in the period of enactment however in response to the complexities and ambiguity surrounding the tax act the sec released staff accounting bulletin no 118 “sab 118” to provide companies with relief around the initial accounting for the tax act pursuant to sab 118 the sec provided a oneyear measurement period for companies to analyze and finalize accounting for the tax act during the oneyear measurement period sab 118 allowed companies to recognize provisional amounts when reasonable estimates could be made for the impacts resulting from the tax act 

vf finalized its accounting for the tax act during the oneyear measurement period under sab 118 and recognized additional net charges of 182 million primarily comprised of 143 million tax expense related to the transition tax additional tax benefits of 03 million related to revaluing us deferred tax assets and liabilities using the new us corporate tax rate of 21 and 42 million tax expense related to establishing a deferred tax liability for foreign withholding taxes resulting in a cumulative net charge of 4837 million the measurement period adjustments include 51 million of net tax benefit recognized in the three months ended march 2018 and 233 million of net tax expense recognized during fiscal 2019 

on january 15 2019 final regulations under section 965 related to the transition tax were released after analyzing these regulations the company recorded an additional net charge of 139 million primarily comprised of 207 million tax expense related to transition tax and a net tax benefit of 68 million related to a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits as a result of the final regulations 

the income tax payable attributable to the transition tax is due over an 8year period beginning in 2018 at march 30 2019 a noncurrent income tax payable of approximately 4161 million attributable to the transition tax is reflected in other liabilities of the consolidated balance sheet 

the tax act created a new tax on certain global intangible lowtax income “gilti” from foreign operations under gaap companies may make an accounting policy election to either treat taxes resulting from gilti as a currentperiod expense when they are incurred or factor such amounts into the measurement of deferred taxes the company completed its analysis of the effects of the gilti provisions and determined it will treat the taxes resulting from gilti as a currentperiod expense which is consistent with the treatment prior to the accounting policy election

at december 30 2017 the nautica ® brand business met the heldforsale and discontinued operations accounting criteria all disclosure throughout part i of this form 10k excludes the  nautica ®  brand business 



our directtoconsumer business includes fullprice stores outlet stores ecommerce sites and concession retail locations directtoconsumer revenues were 32  of total vf revenues in 2017  compared with 29  in 2016  

our fullprice stores allow us to display a brand’s full line of products with fixtures and imagery that support the brand’s positioning and promise to consumers these experiences provide high visibility for our brands and products and enable us to stay close to the needs and preferences of our consumers the complete and impactful presentation of products in our stores also helps to increase sellthrough of vf products at our wholesale customers due to increased brand awareness education and visibility vfoperated fullprice stores generally provide gross margins that are well above vf averages 

in addition vf operates outlet stores in both premium outlet malls and more traditional valuebased locations these outlet stores carry merchandise that is specifically designed for sale in our outlet stores and serve an important role in our overall inventory management and profitability by allowing vf to sell a significant portion of excess discontinued and outofseason products at better prices than otherwise available from outside parties while maintaining the integrity of our brands 

our growing global directtoconsumer operations included 1518  stores at the end of 2017  we operate retail store locations for the following brands vans ®  timberland ®  the north face ®  kipling ®  dickies ®  lee ®  napapijri ®  and wrangler ®  we also operate 80 vf outlet ® stores in the us that sell a broad selection of excess vf products as well as other nonvf products approximately 65 of 

 

vfoperated stores offer products at full price and the remainder are outlet locations approximately 60 of our stores are located in the americas region 55 in the us 25 in europe and 15 in the asiapacific region additionally we have approximately 1100 concession retail stores located principally in europe and asia 

ecommerce represented approximately 21 of our directtoconsumer business in 2017  we currently market the following brands online vans ®  the north face ®  timberland ®  lee ®  kipling ®  wrangler ®    napapijri ®  smartwool ®  jansport ®  eastpak ®  eagle creek ®  reef ®  dickies ®  kodiak ®  and walls ®  we continue to expand our ecommerce initiatives by rolling out additional countryspecific brand sites in europe and asia which enhances our ability to deliver a superior localized consumer experience 

we expect our directtoconsumer business to continue growing at a faster pace than vf’s overall growth rate as we expand our ecommerce presence and open new stores we opened 111  stores during 2017  concentrating on the brands with the highest retail growth potential vans ®  the north face ®  and timberland ®  

in addition to our directtoconsumer operations our licensees distributors and other independent parties own and operate over 3000 partnership stores these are primarily monobrand retail locations selling vf products that have the appearance of vfoperated stores most of these partnership stores are located in europe and asia and are concentrated in the timberland ®  lee ®  the north face ®  vans ®  wrangler ®  kipling ®  and napapijri ® brands

as part of our strategy of expanding market penetration of vfowned brands we enter into licensing agreements with independent parties for specific apparel and complementary product categories when such arrangements provide more effective manufacturing distribution and marketing than could be achieved internally we provide support to these business partners and ensure the integrity of our brand names by taking an active role in the design quality control advertising marketing and distribution of licensed products 

licensing arrangements relate to a broad range of vf brands license agreements are for fixed terms of generally 3 to 5 years 

 

with conditional renewal options each licensee pays royalties to vf based on its sales of licensed products with most agreements providing for a minimum royalty requirement royalties generally range from 4 to 10 of the licensing partners’ net licensed products sales royalty income was 755 million  in 2017  less than 1  of total revenues primarily from the vans ®  lee ®  timberland ®  and wrangler ® brands in addition licensees of our brands are generally required to spend from 1 to 3 of their net licensed product sales to advertise vf’s products in some cases these advertising amounts are remitted to vf for advertising on behalf of the licensees 



product design and innovation including fit fabric finish and quality are important elements across our businesses these functions are performed by employees located in our global supply chain organization and our branded business units across the globe 

in addition to the design functions of each brand vf has three strategic global innovation centers that focus on technical and performance product development for apparel footwear and jeanswear the centers are staffed with dedicated scientists engineers and designers who combine proprietary insights with consumer needs and a deep understanding of technology and new materials these innovation centers are integral to vf’s longterm growth as they allow us to deliver new products and experiences that consistently delight consumers which drives organic growth and higher gross margins 

vf’s centralized global supply chain organization is responsible for producing procuring and delivering products to our customers vf is highly skilled in managing the complexities associated with our global supply chain vf sourced or produced approximately 473 million units spread across more than 30  brands our products are obtained from 21 vfoperated manufacturing facilities and approximately 1000  contractor manufacturing facilities in over 50 countries additionally we operate 38 distribution centers and 1518  retail stores managing this complexity is made possible by the use of a network of information systems for product development forecasting order management and warehouse management along with our core enterprise resource management platforms 

in 2017  23 of our units were manufactured in vfowned facilities and 77  were obtained from independent contractors products manufactured in vf facilities generally have a lower cost and shorter lead times than products procured from independent contractors products obtained from contractors in the western hemisphere generally have a higher cost than products obtained from contractors in asia however contracting in the western hemisphere gives us greater flexibility shorter lead times and allows for lower inventory levels this combination of vfowned and contracted production along with different geographic regions and cost structures provides a wellbalanced flexible approach to product sourcing we will continue to manage our supply chain from a global perspective and adjust as needed to changes in the global production environment 

vf operates manufacturing facilities in the us mexico central america and the caribbean a significant percentage of denim 

 

bottoms and occupational apparel is manufactured in these plants as well as a smaller percentage of footwear and other products for these owned production facilities we purchase raw materials from numerous us and international suppliers to meet our production needs raw materials include products made from cotton leather rubber wool synthetics and blends of cotton and synthetic yarn as well as thread and trim product identification buttons zippers snaps eyelets and laces in some instances we contract the sewing of vfowned raw materials into finished product with independent contractors fixed price commitments for fabric and certain supplies are generally set on a quarterly basis for the next quarter’s purchases no single supplier represents more than 10 of our total cost of goods sold 

independent contractors generally own the raw materials and ship finished readyforsale products to vf these contractors are engaged through vf sourcing hubs in hong kong with satellite offices across asia and panama these hubs are responsible for managing the manufacturing and procurement of product supplier oversight product quality assurance sustainability within the supply chain responsible sourcing and transportation and shipping functions in addition our hubs leverage proprietary knowledge and technology to enable certain contractors to more effectively control costs and improve labor efficiency substantially all products in the outdoor  action sports coalition as well as a portion of products for our jeanswear and imagewear coalitions are obtained through these sourcing hubs 

management continually monitors political risks and developments related to duties tariffs and quotas we limit vf’s sourcing exposure through among other measures i diversifying geographies with a mix of vfoperated and contracted production ii shifting of production among countries and contractors iii sourcing production to merchandise categories where product is readily available and iv sourcing from countries with tariff preference and free trade agreements vf does not directly or indirectly source products from suppliers in countries that are prohibited by the us state department 

all vfoperated production facilities throughout the world as well as all independent contractor facilities that manufacture vf products must comply with vf’s global compliance principles these principles established in 1997 and consistent with international labor standards are a set of strict standards covering legal and ethical business practices worker age work hours health and safety conditions environmental standards and compliance with local laws and regulations in addition our owned 

vf corporation 2017 form 10k 5 

factories must also undergo certification by the independent nonprofit organization worldwide responsible accredited production “wrap” which promotes global ethics in manufacturing 

vf through its contractor monitoring program audits the activities of the independent businesses and contractors that produce vf products at locations across the globe each of the approximately 1000  independent contractor facilities including those serving our independent licensees must be precertified before producing vf products this precertification includes passing a factory inspection and signing a vf terms of engagement agreement we maintain an ongoing audit program to ensure compliance with these requirements by using dedicated internal staff and externally contracted firms additional information about vf’s code of business conduct global compliance principles terms of engagement and environmental compliance guidelines along with a global compliance report is available on the vf website at wwwvfccom 

 

vf did not experience difficulty in fulfilling its raw material and contracting production needs during 2017  absent any material changes vf believes it would be able to largely offset any increases in product costs through i the continuing shift in the mix of its business to higher margin brands geographies and channels of distribution ii increases in the prices of its products and iii cost reduction efforts the loss of any one supplier or contractor would not have a significant adverse effect on our business 

product is shipped from our independent suppliers and vfoperated manufacturing facilities to distribution centers around the world in some instances product is shipped directly to our customers most distribution centers are operated by vf and some support more than one brand a portion of our distribution needs are met by contract distribution centers 



vf’s quarterly operating results vary due to the seasonality of our individual businesses and are historically stronger in the second half of the year on a quarterly basis in 2017  revenues ranged from a low of 19 of full year revenues in the second quarter to a high of 31 in the fourth quarter while operating margin ranged from a low of 7 in the second quarter to a high of 17 in the third quarter this variation results primarily from the seasonal influences on revenues of our outdoor  action sports coalition where 18 of the coalition’s revenues occurred in the second quarter compared to 30 in the fourth quarter of 2017  with changes in our mix of business and the growth of our retail 

 

operations historical quarterly revenue and profit trends may not be indicative of future trends 

working capital requirements vary throughout the year working capital increases early in the year as inventory builds to support peak shipping periods and then moderates later in the year as those inventories are sold and accounts receivable are collected cash provided by operating activities is substantially higher in the second half of the year due to higher net income during that period and reduced working capital requirements particularly during the fourth quarter 



during 2017  our advertising and promotion expense was 7159 million  representing 6  of total revenues we advertise in consumer and trade publications on radio and television and through digital initiatives including social media and mobile platforms on the internet we also participate in cooperative advertising on a shared cost basis with major retailers in print and digital media radio and television we sponsor sporting musical and special events as well as athletes and personalities who promote our products we employ marketing sciences to optimize the impact of advertising and promotional spending and to identify the types of spending that provide the greatest return on our marketing investments 

we provide advertising support to our wholesale customers in the form of pointofsale fixtures and signage to enhance the presentation and brand image of our products we also participate in shopinshops and concession retail arrangements which are separate sales areas dedicated to a specific vf brand within our customers’ stores to help differentiate and enhance the presentation of our products 

we contribute to incentive programs with our wholesale customers including cooperative advertising funds discounts and allowances we also offer sales incentive programs directly to consumers in the form of rebate and coupon offers 

 

in addition to sponsorships and activities that directly benefit our products and brands vf and its associates actively support our communities and various charities for example the north face ® brand has committed to programs that encourage and enable outdoor participation such as the north face endurance challenge ®  and the north face explore fund™  programs the timberland ® brand has a strong heritage of volunteerism including the path of service™  program that offers fulltime employees up to 40 hours of paid time off a year to serve their local communities through global service events such as earth day in the spring and servapalooza in the fall the wrangler ®  brand launched the tough enough to wear pink ™ program which honors and raises money for breast cancer survivors and the national patriot program™  which funds agencies that serve wounded and fallen american military veterans and their families the vans ®  brand has hosted annual vans ®  earth day and vans ®  gives back day events in which all employees at brand headquarters spend the day volunteering in the community

vf is one of the world’s largest apparel footwear and accessories manufacturers and our global scale is significant equally significant is the responsibility we have to make an impact on the industry and our planet in advancing sustainable business vf has set goals and made commitments to achieve significant progress in several different key areas of sustainability in an effort to accomplish this

vf’s large global presence necessitates a comprehensive approach to managing our impacts the work that has been done to date has allowed us to make great strides in promoting the responsible stewardship of our scale success in this area has demonstrated that the vf scale is not something that simply needs to be managed for impact but can also be used for good to create significant value

 item 1a risk factors 

tableend

the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating vf’s business and the forwardlooking statements contained in this form 10k any of the following risks could materially adversely affect vf’s business its operating results and its financial condition 

vf’s revenues and profits depend on the level of consumer spending for apparel and footwear which is sensitive to global economic conditions and other factors a decline in consumer spending could have a material adverse effect on vf 

the success of vf’s business depends on consumer spending on apparel and footwear and there are a number of factors that influence consumer spending including actual and perceived economic conditions disposable consumer income interest rates consumer credit availability unemployment stock market performance weather conditions energy prices consumer discretionary spending patterns and tax rates in the international national regional and local markets where vf’s products are sold the current global economic environment is unpredictable and adverse economic trends or other factors could negatively impact the level of consumer spending which could have a material adverse impact on vf 

the apparel and footwear industries are highly competitive and vf’s success depends on its ability to gauge consumer preferences and product trends and to respond to constantly changing markets 

vf competes with numerous apparel and footwear brands and manufacturers competition is generally based upon brand name recognition price design product quality selection service and purchasing convenience some of our competitors are larger and have more resources than vf in some product categories and regions in addition vf competes directly with the private label brands of its wholesale customers vf’s ability to compete within the apparel and footwear industries depends on our ability to 

 failure to compete effectively or to keep pace with rapidly changing consumer preferences markets and product trends could have a material adverse effect on vf’s business financial condition and results of operations moreover there are significant shifts underway in the wholesale and retail ecommerce and retail store channels vf may not be able to manage its brands within and across channels sufficiently which could have a material adverse effect on vf’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

vf’s results of operations could be materially harmed if we are unable to accurately forecast demand for our products 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully anticipate changing consumer preferences and product trends or economic conditions and as a result we may not successfully manage inventory levels to meet our future order requirements we often schedule internal production and place orders for products with independent manufacturers before our customers’ orders are firm if we fail to accurately forecast consumer demand we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of product required to meet the demand inventory levels in excess of consumer demand may result in inventory writedowns the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices or excess inventory held by our wholesale customers which could have a negative impact on future sales an adverse effect on the image and reputation of vf’s brands and negatively impact profitability on the other hand if we underestimate demand for our products our manufacturing facilities or thirdparty manufacturers may not be able to produce products to meet consumer requirements and this could result in delays in the shipment of products and lost revenues as well as damage to vf’s reputation and relationships these risks could have a material adverse effect on our brand image as well as our results of operations and financial condition 

vf’s business and the success of its products could be harmed if vf is unable to maintain the images of its brands 

vf’s success to date has been due in large part to the growth of its brands’ images and vf’s customers’ connection to its brands if we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to changing consumer demand the names and images of our brands may be impaired even if we react appropriately to changes in consumer preferences consumers may consider our brands’ images to be outdated or associate our brands with styles that are no longer popular in addition brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of qualities including merchandise quality and corporate integrity negative claims or publicity regarding vf its brands or its products including licensed products could adversely affect our reputation and sales regardless of whether such claims are accurate social media which accelerates the dissemination of information can increase the challenges of responding to negative claims in the past many apparel companies have experienced periods of rapid growth in sales and earnings followed by periods of declining sales and losses our businesses may be similarly affected in the future in addition we have sponsorship contracts with a number of athletes musicians and celebrities and feature those individuals in our advertising and marketing efforts actions taken by those individuals associated with our products could harm their reputations which could adversely affect the images of our brands 

vf’s revenues and cash requirements are affected by the seasonal nature of its business 

vf’s business is increasingly seasonal with a higher proportion of revenues and operating cash flows generated during the second half of the fiscal year which includes the fall and holiday selling seasons poor sales in the second half of the fiscal year would have a material adverse effect on vf’s full year operating results and cause higher inventories in addition fluctuations in sales and operating income in any fiscal quarter are affected by the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales 

vf corporation 2017 form 10k 9 

vf’s profitability may decline as a result of increasing pressure on margins 

the apparel industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors including intense competition consolidation in the retail industry pressure from retailers to reduce the costs of products and changes in consumer demand if these factors cause us to reduce our sales prices to retailers and consumers and we fail to sufficiently reduce our product costs or operating expenses vf’s profitability will decline this could have a material adverse effect on vf’s results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

vf may not succeed in its business strategy 

one of vf’s key strategic objectives is growth we seek to grow organically and through acquisitions we seek to grow by building our lifestyle brands expanding our share with winning customers stretching vf’s brands to new regions managing costs leveraging our supply chain and information technology capabilities across vf and expanding our directtoconsumer business including opening new stores remodeling and expanding our existing stores and growing our ecommerce business however we may not be able to grow our existing businesses for example 

 failure to implement our strategic objectives may have a material adverse effect on vf’s business 

vf relies significantly on information technology any inadequacy interruption integration failure or security failure of this technology could harm vf’s ability to effectively operate its business 

our ability to effectively manage and operate our business depends significantly on information technology systems we rely heavily on information technology to track sales and inventory and manage our supply chain we are also dependent on information technology including the internet for our directtoconsumer sales including our ecommerce operations and retail business credit card transaction authorization despite our preventative efforts our systems and those of our thirdparty service providers may be vulnerable to damage or interruption the failure of these systems to operate effectively problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems difficulty in integrating new 

 

systems or systems of acquired businesses or a breach in security of these systems could adversely impact the operations of vf’s business including management of inventory ordering and replenishment of products ecommerce operations retail business credit card transaction authorization and processing corporate email communications and our interaction with the public on social media 

vf is subject to data security and privacy risks that could negatively affect its business operations results of operations or reputation 

in the normal course of business we often collect retain and transmit certain sensitive and confidential customer information including credit card information over public networks there is a significant concern by consumers and employees over the security of personal information transmitted over the internet identity theft and user privacy despite the security measures we currently have in place our facilities and systems and those of our thirdparty service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches and vf and its customers could suffer harm if customer and other proprietary information were accessed by third parties due to a security failure in vf’s systems or one of our thirdparty service providers it could require significant expenditures to remediate any such failure or breach severely damage our reputation and our relationships with customers and expose us to risks of litigation and liability in addition as a result of recent security breaches at a number of prominent retailers the media and public scrutiny of information security and privacy has become more intense and the regulatory environment has become more uncertain as a result we may incur significant costs to comply with laws regarding the protection and unauthorized disclosure of personal information and we may not be able to comply with new regulations such as the general data protection regulation in the european union 

vf’s business is exposed to the risks of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations vf’s hedging strategies may not be effective in mitigating those risks 

a growing percentage of vf’s total revenues approximately 41  in 2017  is derived from markets outside the us vf’s international businesses operate in functional currencies other than the us dollar changes in currency exchange rates affect the us dollar value of the foreign currencydenominated amounts at which vf’s international businesses purchase products incur costs or sell products in addition for vf’s usbased businesses the majority of products are sourced from independent contractors or vf plants located in foreign countries as a result the costs of these products are affected by changes in the value of the relevant currencies furthermore much of vf’s licensing revenue is derived from sales in foreign currencies changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse impact on vf’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in accordance with our operating practices we hedge a significant portion of our foreign currency transaction exposures arising in the ordinary course of business to reduce risks in our cash flows and earnings our hedging strategy may not be effective in reducing all risks and no hedging strategy can completely insulate vf from foreign exchange risk 

further our use of derivative financial instruments may expose vf to counterparty risks although vf only enters into hedging contracts with counterparties having investment grade credit ratings it is possible that the credit quality of a counterparty could be downgraded or a counterparty could default on its obligations 

10          vf corporation 2017 form 10k 

which could have a material adverse impact on vf’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

there are risks associated with vf’s acquisitions 

any acquisitions or mergers by vf will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of companies these risks include among other things higher than anticipated acquisition costs and expenses the difficulty and expense of integrating the operations systems and personnel of the companies and the loss of key employees and customers as a result of changes in management in addition geographic distances may make integration of acquired businesses more difficult we may not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with any acquisitions 

our acquisitions may cause large onetime expenses or create goodwill or other intangible assets that could result in significant impairment charges in the future we also make certain estimates and assumptions in order to determine purchase price allocation and estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed if our estimates or assumptions used to value these assets and liabilities are not accurate we may be exposed to losses that may be material 

vf’s operations and earnings may be affected by legal regulatory political and economic risks 

our ability to maintain the current level of operations in our existing markets and to capitalize on growth in existing and new markets is subject to legal regulatory political and economic risks these include the burdens of complying with us and international laws and regulations unexpected changes in regulatory requirements tariffs or other trade barriers and the economic uncertainty associated with the pending exit of the united kingdom from the european union brexit or any other similar referendums that may be held 

a significant portion of vfs 2017 net income was earned in jurisdictions outside the us and most of our goods are manufactured outside the us vf is exposed to risks of changes in us policy for companies having business operations and manufacturing products outside the us we cannot predict any changes to us participation in or renegotiations of certain trade agreements or whether quotas duties taxes exchange controls or other restrictions will be imposed by the us the european union or other countries on the import or export of our products or what effect any of these actions would have on vf’s business financial condition or results of operations changes in regulatory geopolitical policies and other factors may adversely affect vf’s business or may require us to modify our current business practices while enactment of any such change is not certain if such changes were adopted our costs could increase which would reduce our earnings 

changes in tax laws could increase our worldwide tax rate and materially affect our financial position and results of operations 

we are subject to taxation in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” which includes a broad range of tax reform proposals affecting businesses including a reduction in the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 a onetime mandatory deemed repatriation tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and a new minimum 

 

tax on certain foreign earnings the tax act significantly impacts our effective tax rate for 2017 as a result of the deemed repatriation tax and may impact several other elements of our operating model in future years certain additional provisions of the tax act such as a minimum tax on foreign earnings will also apply to vf and as a result could increase our effective tax rate taxes due over a period of time as a result of the new tax law could be accelerated upon certain triggering events including failure to pay such taxes when due the new law makes broad and complex changes to the us tax code and we expect to see future regulatory administrative or legislative guidance we are analyzing the tax act to determine the full impact of the new tax law and to the extent any future guidance differs from our preliminary interpretation of the law it could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 

in addition many countries in the european union and around the globe have adopted andor proposed changes to current tax laws further organizations such as the organization for economic cooperation and development have published action plans that if adopted by countries where we do business could increase our tax obligations in these countries due to the large scale of our us and international business activities many of these enacted and proposed changes to the taxation of our activities could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations 

we may have additional tax liabilities 

as a global company we determine our income tax liability in various tax jurisdictions based on an analysis and interpretation of local tax laws and regulations this analysis requires a significant amount of judgment and estimation and is often based on various assumptions about the future actions of the local tax authorities these determinations are the subject of periodic us and international tax audits although we accrue for uncertain tax positions our accrual may be insufficient to satisfy unfavorable findings unfavorable audit findings and tax rulings may result in payment of taxes fines and penalties for prior periods and higher tax rates in future periods which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows   

vf’s balance sheet includes a significant amount of intangible assets and goodwill a decline in the fair value of an intangible asset or of a business unit could result in an asset impairment charge which would be recorded as an operating expense in vf’s consolidated statement of income and could be material 

vf’s policy is to evaluate indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill for possible impairment as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of such assets may be below their carrying amount in addition intangible assets that are being amortized are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable for these impairment tests we use various valuation methods to estimate the fair value of our business units and intangible assets if the fair value of an asset is less than its carrying value we would recognize an impairment charge for the difference 

it is possible that we could have an impairment charge for goodwill or trademark and trade name intangible assets in future periods if i overall economic conditions in 2018 or future years vary from our current assumptions ii business conditions or our strategies for a specific business unit change from our current assumptions iii investors require higher rates of return on equity investments 

vf corporation 2017 form 10k 11 

in the marketplace or iv enterprise values of comparable publicly traded companies or of actual sales transactions of comparable companies were to decline resulting in lower comparable multiples of revenues and earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and accordingly lower implied values of goodwill and intangible assets a future impairment charge for goodwill or intangible assets could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

vf uses thirdparty suppliers and manufacturing facilities worldwide for a substantial portion of its raw materials and finished products which poses risks to vf’s business operations 

during fiscal 2017  approximately 77  of vf’s units were purchased from independent manufacturers primarily located in asia with substantially all of the remainder produced by vfowned and operated manufacturing facilities located in the us mexico central america and the caribbean any of the following could impact our ability to produce or deliver vf products or our cost of producing or delivering products and as a result our profitability 

 although no single supplier and no one country is critical to vf’s production needs if we were to lose a supplier it could result in interruption of finished goods shipments to vf cancellation of orders by customers and termination of relationships this along with the damage to our reputation could have a material adverse 

 

effect on vf’s revenues and consequently our results of operations 

our business is subject to national state and local laws and regulations for environmental consumer protection employment privacy safety and other matters the costs of compliance with or the violation of such laws and regulations by vf or by independent suppliers who manufacture products for vf could have an adverse effect on our operations and cash flows as well as on our reputation 

our business is subject to comprehensive national state and local laws and regulations on a wide range of environmental consumer protection employment privacy safety and other matters vf could be adversely affected by costs of compliance with or violations of those laws and regulations in addition while we do not control their business practices we require thirdparty suppliers to operate in compliance with applicable laws rules and regulations regarding working conditions employment practices and environmental compliance the costs of products purchased by vf from independent contractors could increase due to the costs of compliance by those contractors 

failure by vf or its thirdparty suppliers to comply with such laws and regulations as well as with ethical social product labor and environmental standards or related political considerations could result in interruption of finished goods shipments to vf cancellation of orders by customers and termination of relationships if one of our independent contractors violates labor or other laws implements labor or other business practices or takes other actions that are generally regarded as unethical it could jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions including boycotts that may reduce demand for vf’s merchandise damage to vf’s reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on vf’s results of operations financial condition and cash flows as well as require additional resources to rebuild vf’s reputation 

fluctuations in wage rates and the price availability and quality of raw materials and finished goods could increase costs 

fluctuations in the price availability and quality of fabrics leather or other raw materials used by vf in its manufactured products or of purchased finished goods could have a material adverse effect on vf’s cost of goods sold or its ability to meet its customers’ demands the prices we pay depend on demand and market prices for the raw materials used to produce them the price and availability of such raw materials may fluctuate significantly depending on many factors including general economic conditions and demand crop yields energy prices weather patterns and speculation in the commodities markets prices of purchased finished products also depend on wage rates in asia and other geographic areas where our independent contractors are located as well as freight costs from those regions in addition fluctuations in wage rates required by legal or industry standards could increase our costs in the future vf may not be able to offset cost increases with other cost reductions or efficiencies or to pass higher costs on to its customers this could have a material adverse effect on vf’s results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

we may be adversely affected by weather conditions 

our business is adversely affected by unseasonable weather conditions a significant portion of the sales of our products is dependent in part on the weather and is likely to decline in years in which weather conditions do not favor the use of these products 

12          vf corporation 2017 form 10k 

for example periods of unseasonably warm weather in the fall or winter can lead to inventory accumulation by our wholesale customers which can in turn negatively affect orders in future seasons in addition abnormally harsh or inclement weather can also negatively impact retail traffic and consumer spending any and all of these risks may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

a substantial portion of vf’s revenues and gross profit is derived from a small number of large customers the loss of any of these customers or the inability of any of these customers to pay vf could substantially reduce vf’s revenues and profits 

a few of vf’s customers account for a significant portion of revenues sales to vf’s ten largest customers were 19  of total revenues in 2017  with our largest customer accounting for 8  of revenues sales to our customers are generally on a purchase order basis and not subject to longterm agreements a decision by any of vf’s major customers to significantly decrease the volume of products purchased from vf could substantially reduce revenues and have a material adverse effect on vf’s financial condition and results of operations 

the retail industry has experienced financial difficulty that could increase vfs bad debt 

recently there have been consolidations reorganizations restructurings bankruptcies and ownership changes in the retail industry these events individually and together could materially adversely affect vfs business these changes could impact vf’s opportunities in the market and increase vf’s reliance on a smaller number of large customers in the future retailers are likely to further consolidate undergo restructurings or reorganizations or bankruptcies realign their affiliations or reposition their stores’ target markets these developments could result in a reduction in the number of stores that carry vf’s products an increase in ownership concentration within the retail industry an increase in credit exposure to vf or an increase in leverage by vf’s customers over their suppliers 

further the global economy periodically experiences recessionary conditions with rising unemployment reduced availability of credit increased savings rates and declines in real estate and securities values these recessionary conditions could have a negative impact on retail sales of apparel and other consumer products the lower sales volumes along with the possibility of restrictions on access to the credit markets could result in our customers experiencing financial difficulties including store closures bankruptcies or liquidations this could result in higher credit risk to vf relating to receivables from our customers who are experiencing these financial difficulties if these developments occur our inability to shift sales to other customers or to collect on vf’s trade accounts receivable could have a material adverse effect on vf’s financial condition and results of operations 

our ability to obtain shortterm or longterm financing on favorable terms if needed could be adversely affected by geopolitical risk and volatility in the capital markets 

any disruption in the capital markets could limit the availability of funds or the ability or willingness of financial institutions to extend capital in the future this could adversely affect our liquidity and funding resources or significantly increase our cost of capital an inability to access capital and credit markets may have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

 

vf has a global revolving credit facility one or more of the participating banks may not be able to honor their commitments which could have an adverse effect on vf’s business 

vf has a 225 billion global revolving credit facility that expires in april 2020 if the financial markets return to recessionary conditions this could impair the ability of one or more of the banks participating in our credit agreements to honor their commitments this could have an adverse effect on our business if we were not able to replace those commitments or to locate other sources of liquidity on acceptable terms 

the loss of members of vf’s executive management and other key employees could have a material adverse effect on its business 

vf depends on the services and management experience of its executive officers and business leaders who have substantial experience and expertise in vf’s business the unexpected loss of services of one or more of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on vf our future success also depends on our ability to recruit retain and engage our personnel sufficiently competition for experienced and wellqualified personnel is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 

vf’s directtoconsumer business includes risks that could have an adverse effect on its results of operations 

vf sells merchandise directtoconsumer through vfoperated stores and ecommerce sites its directtoconsumer business is subject to numerous risks that could have a material adverse effect on its results risks include but are not limited to a us or international resellers purchasing merchandise and reselling it overseas outside vf’s control b failure of the systems that operate the stores and websites and their related support systems including computer viruses theft of customer information privacy concerns telecommunication failures and electronic breakins and similar disruptions c credit card fraud and d risks related to vf’s directtoconsumer distribution centers and processes risks specific to vf’s ecommerce business also include a diversion of sales from vf stores or wholesale customers b difficulty in recreating the instore experience through direct channels c liability for online content d changing patterns of consumer behavior and e intense competition from online retailers vf’s failure to successfully respond to these risks might adversely affect sales in its ecommerce business as well as damage its reputation and brands 

our vfoperated stores and ecommerce business require substantial fixed investments in equipment and leasehold improvements information systems inventory and personnel we have entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space due to the high fixedcost structure associated with our directtoconsumer operations a decline in sales or the closure of or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs writeoffs of equipment and leasehold improvements and employeerelated costs 

vf’s net sales depend on the volume of traffic to its stores and the availability of suitable lease space 

a growing portion of our revenues are directtoconsumer sales through vfoperated stores in order to generate customer traffic we locate many of our stores in prominent locations within successful retail shopping centers or in fashionable shopping districts our stores benefit from the ability of the retail center and 

vf corporation 2017 form 10k 13 

other attractions in an area to generate consumer traffic in the vicinity of our stores part of our future growth is significantly dependent on our ability to operate stores in desirable locations with capital investment and lease costs providing the opportunity to earn a reasonable return we cannot control the development of new shopping centers or districts the availability or cost of appropriate locations within existing or new shopping centers or districts competition with other retailers for prominent locations or the success of individual shopping centers or districts further if we are unable to renew or replace our existing store leases or enter into leases for new stores on favorable terms or if we violate the terms of our current leases our growth and profitability could be harmed all of these factors may impact our ability to meet our growth targets and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

vf may be unable to protect its trademarks and other intellectual property rights 

vf’s trademarks and other intellectual property rights are important to its success and its competitive position vf is susceptible to others copying its products and infringing its intellectual property rights especially with the shift in product mix to higher priced brands and innovative new products in recent years some of vf’s brands such as the north face ®  timberland ®  vans ®  jansport ®  dickies ®  wrangler ®  and lee ®  enjoy significant worldwide consumer recognition and the higher pricing of those products creates additional risk of counterfeiting and infringement 

vf’s trademarks trade names patents trade secrets and other intellectual property are important to vf’s success counterfeiting of vf’s products or infringement on its intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our brands and adversely affect vf’s revenues actions we have taken to establish and protect vf’s intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent copying of its products by others or to prevent others from seeking to invalidate its trademarks or block sales of vf’s products as a violation of the trademarks and intellectual property rights of others in addition unilateral actions in the us or other countries including changes to or the repeal of laws recognizing trademark or other intellectual property rights could have an impact on vf’s ability to enforce those rights 

the value of vf’s intellectual property could diminish if others assert rights in or ownership of trademarks and other intellectual property rights of vf or trademarks that are similar to vf’s trademarks or trademarks that vf licenses from others we may be unable to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction in some cases there may be trademark owners who have prior rights to vf’s trademarks because the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the us in other cases there may be holders who have prior rights to similar trademarks vf is from time to time involved in opposition and cancellation proceedings with respect to some of its intellectual property rights 

we may be subject to liability if third parties successfully claim that we infringe on their trademarks copyrights patents or other intellectual property rights defending infringement claims could be expensive and timeconsuming and might result in our entering into costly license agreements 

 

vf is subject to the risk that its licensees may not generate expected sales or maintain the value of vf’s brands 

during 2017  755 million  of vf’s revenues were derived from licensing royalties although vf generally has significant control over its licensees’ products and advertising we rely on our licensees for among other things operational and financial controls over their businesses failure of our licensees to successfully market licensed products or our inability to replace existing licensees if necessary could adversely affect vf’s revenues both directly from reduced royalties received and indirectly from reduced sales of our other products risks are also associated with a licensee’s ability to 

 in addition vf relies on its licensees to help preserve the value of its brands although we attempt to protect vf’s brands through approval rights over design production processes quality packaging merchandising distribution advertising and promotion of our licensed products we cannot completely control the use of licensed vf brands by our licensees the misuse of a brand by a licensee could have a material adverse effect on that brand and on vf 

if vf encounters problems with its distribution system vf’s ability to deliver its products to the market could be adversely affected 

vf relies on owned or independentlyoperated distribution facilities to warehouse and ship product to its customers vf’s distribution system includes computercontrolled and automated equipment which may be subject to a number of risks related to security or computer viruses the proper operation of software and hardware power interruptions or other system failures because substantially all of vf’s products are distributed from a relatively small number of locations vf’s operations could also be interrupted by earthquakes floods fires or other natural disasters affecting its distribution centers we maintain business interruption insurance but it may not adequately protect vf from the adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in vf’s distribution facilities such as the longterm loss of customers or an erosion of brand image in addition vf’s distribution capacity is dependent on the timely performance of services by third parties including the transportation of product to and from its distribution facilities if we encounter problems with our distribution system our ability to meet customer expectations manage inventory complete sales and achieve operating efficiencies could be materially adversely affected 

volatility in securities markets interest rates and other economic factors could substantially increase vf’s defined benefit pension costs 

vf currently has obligations under its defined benefit pension plans the funded status of the pension plans is dependent on many factors including returns on investment assets and the discount rate used to determine pension obligations unfavorable impacts from returns on plan assets decreases in discount rates changes in plan demographics or revisions in the applicable laws or regulations could materially change the timing and amount of 

14          vf corporation 2017 form 10k 

pension funding requirements which could reduce cash available for vf’s business 

vf’s operating performance also may be negatively impacted by the amount of expense recorded for its pension plans pension expense is calculated using actuarial valuations that incorporate 

 

assumptions and estimates about financial market economic and demographic conditions differences between estimated and actual results give rise to gains and losses that are deferred and amortized as part of future pension expense which can create volatility that adversely impacts vf’s future operating results

we continued reshaping our portfolio in 2017 to align with our financial aspirations as we closed on the acquisition of williamsondickie mfg co williamsondickie in the fourth quarter of 2017 and announced the acquisition of icebreaker holdings ltd which we expect to close in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 further we completed the sale of the licensing business in 2017 and have announced the planned sale of the nautica ®  brand business 

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act “tax act” the tax act significantly changes us corporate income tax laws by among other things reducing the us corporate income tax rate to 21 starting in 2018 and moves from a global taxation regime to a modified territorial regime as part of the legislation us companies are required to pay a tax on historical earnings generated offshore that have not been repatriated to the us and revalue deferred tax asset and liability positions at the lower federal base tax rate of 21 the transitional impact of the tax act resulted in a provisional net

charge of approximately of 4655 million or 115 cents per share during the fourth quarter of 2017 

the execution of our 2021 strategic choices including the reshaping of our portfolio and significant changes to the us corporate income tax laws delivered the following results in 2017  



 







the following table presents a summary of the changes in total revenues during the last two years 



2017  compared to 2016   

vf reported a 7 increase in revenues in 2017  the 2017  results were driven by an increase in the outdoor  action sports coalition and continued strength in our directtoconsumer and international businesses the increase was also attributable to growth in the imagewear coalition which included a 2472 million contribution from the williamsondickie acquisition which closed on october 2 2017 these increases were offset by declines in the jeanswear coalition international sales grew in every region in 2017  

 

2016  compared to 2015   

vf reported revenues in 2016  that were in line with 2015 revenues the 2016 results were primarily attributable to a 2 increase in the outdoor  action sports coalition and continued strength in the international and directtoconsumer businesses which offset foreign currency headwinds of 1 and softness in our jeanswear and imagewear coalitions excluding the negative impact from foreign currency international sales grew in every region in 2016

2017  compared to 2016 

  

gross margin improved 120 basis points to 505  in 2017  compared to 493  in 2016  reflecting a 180 basis point benefit from pricing a mixshift toward higher margin businesses and lower restructuring costs which was partially offset by a 60 basis point impact from foreign currency 

selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased 160 basis points in 2017  compared to 2016  this increase is primarily due to investments in our key growth priorities which include directtoconsumer product innovation demand creation and technology initiatives the increases were offset by lower restructuring costs in 2017 and a pension settlement charge of 509 million in 2016 which did not recur in 2017 

in 2017  operating margin increased 30 basis points to 127  from 124  in 2016  in addition to the items described above the increase in operating margin reflects a 70 basis point increase from goodwill and intangible asset impairments in 2016 that did not recur in 2017 

net interest expense increased 03 million to 859 million in 2017  the increase in net interest expense was due to higher interest rates on shortterm borrowings and higher interest on longterm debt balances due to a full year of interest on the €850 million eurodenominated 0625 fixedrate notes issued in september 2016 which were partially offset by the payoff of the 2500 million of 595 fixedrate notes on november 1 2017 and an increase in international shortterm investment rates 

outstanding interestbearing debt averaged 32 billion for 2017  compared to 26 billion for 2016  with shortterm borrowings representing 27 and 37 of average debt outstanding for the respective years the weighted average interest rates on outstanding debt were 31 in 2017  and 35 in 2016  as the impact of the issuance of €850 million eurodenominated 0625 fixedrate notes in september of 2016 was offset by higher shortterm debt rates 

other income expense primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses the funding fee charged on the sale of our trade receivables and nonoperating gains and losses other income expense netted to 07 million  and 20 million  in 2017  and 2016  respectively 

the effective income tax rate was 491 in 2017 compared to 160 in 2016 the effective income tax rate is substantially higher in 2017 when compared to 2016 primarily due to discrete tax expense associated with the tax act the tax act reduces the federal tax rate on us earnings to 21 and moves from a global taxation regime to a modified territorial regime as part of the legislation us companies are required to pay a tax on historical earnings generated offshore that have not been repatriated to the us additionally revaluation of deferred tax asset and liability positions at the lower federal base rate of 21 is also required the transitional impact of the tax act resulted in a provisional net charge of 4655 million or 115 per share during the fourth quarter of 2017 this amount which is included in the income taxes line item in the consolidated statements of income is primarily comprised of approximately 5124 million related to the transition tax and approximately 895 million tax benefit related to revaluing us deferred tax assets and liabilities using the new us corporate tax rate of 21 other provisional charges of 426 million were primarily related to us federal and state tax on 

 

foreign income and dividends and establishing a deferred tax liability for foreign withholding taxes 

the 2017 effective income tax rate included a net discrete tax expense of 4389 million which included the provisional net charge of 4655 million related to the tax act 252 million of tax benefits related to stock compensation 29 million of net tax benefit related to the realization of previously unrecognized tax benefits and interest and 19 million of discrete tax expense related to the effects of tax rate changes exclusive of the tax act the 4389 million net discrete tax expense in 2017 increased the effective income tax rate by 310 compared to a favorable 34 impact of discrete items in 2016 without discrete items the effective tax rate during 2017 decreased by approximately 13 primarily due to the negative tax impact related to the 2016 goodwill impairment the international effective tax rate was 131 and 109 for 2017 and 2016 respectively 

as a result of the above net income in 2017  was 07 billion   179  per diluted share compared to 11 billion   256  per diluted share in 2016  

2016  compared to 2015   

in 2016  gross margin improved 30 basis points reflecting a 130 basis point benefit from pricing lower product costs and a mixshift toward higher margin businesses which was partially offset by a 20 basis point impact from restructuring activities and a negative 80 basis point impact from foreign currency 

selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased 210 basis points compared to 2015  this increase was primarily due to restructuring initiatives of 318 million a pension settlement charge of 509 million investments in our key growth priorities which include directtoconsumer product innovation demand creation and technology initiatives and the benefit of a 166 million gain on the sale of a vf outlet ®  location in 2015

in 2016  operating margin decreased 260 basis points to 124  from 150  in 2015  the decrease in operating margin reflects a 170 basis point decrease from goodwill and intangible asset impairment restructuring and pension settlement charges that did not occur in 2015 a negative 60 basis point impact from changes in foreign currency and investments in our key growth priorities which include directtoconsumer product innovation demand creation and technology initiatives 

in 2016  net interest expense increased 39 million to 855 million primarily due to higher interest rates on shortterm borrowings and an increase in longterm debt due to the issuance of €850 million eurodenominated 0625 fixedrate notes in september 2016 

outstanding interestbearing debt averaged 26 billion for 2016  and 24 billion for 2015  with shortterm borrowings representing 37 and 42 of average debt outstanding for the respective years the weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt was 35 in both 2016  and 2015  as the impact of the issuance of €850 million 

vf corporation 2017 form 10k 23 

eurodenominated 0625 fixedrate notes in september of 2016 was offset by higher shortterm debt rates 

other income expense netted to 20 million  and 10 million  in 2016 and 2015  respectively 

the effective income tax rate was 160 in 2016 compared to 222 in 2015 the 2016 tax rate included a net discrete tax benefit of 431 million which included 279 million of tax benefits related to the early adoption of the accounting standards update on stock compensation 132 million of net tax benefits related to the realization of previously unrecognized tax benefits and interest and 41 million of discrete tax expense related to the effects of tax rate changes the 431 million net discrete tax benefit in 2016 reduced the effective income tax rate by 34 compared to a favorable 28 impact of discrete items in 2015 without discrete items the effective tax rate during 2016 decreased by approximately 56 primarily due to i a higher percentage of 

 

foreign earnings in 2016 ii the comparative impact of tax benefits recorded in 2016 related to the utilization of foreign tax attributes iii the full year benefits of the federal research tax credit and other incentives signed into law in december 2015 and iv the negative tax impact related to the 2016 goodwill impairment the international effective tax rate was 109 and 125 for 2016 and 2015 respectively 

as a result of the above net income in 2016  was 11 billion   256  per diluted share compared to 12 billion   282  per diluted share in 2015  the decrease in diluted earnings per share in 2016  compared to 2015  was the result of goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges 015 per share restructuring charges 010 per share and a pension settlement charge 007 per share

global revenues for the timberland ®  brand were up 1 in 2016 driven by growth in the directtoconsumer channel and international business partially offset by weaker wholesale revenues in the us 

global directtoconsumer revenues for outdoor  action sports grew 12 in 2016 driven by new store openings and an expanding ecommerce business partially offset by an unfavorable 1 impact from foreign currency wholesale revenues were down 4 in 2016 primarily due to retailer bankruptcies and reduced offprice shipments in the us and a negative impact from foreign currency of 1

the 60 basis point increase in operating margin in 2016 compared to 2015 was driven by improved gross margin primarily due to favorable pricing product mix and foreign currency impacts partially offset by restructuring charges 

other 



vf outlet ®  stores in the us sell both vf and nonvf products revenues and profits of vf products sold in these stores are reported as part of the operating results of the applicable coalition while revenues and profits of nonvf products are reported in this “other” category the improvement in profit and operating margin 

 

in 2017 was due to no restructuring charges during the year the decrease in profit and operating margin in 2016 was primarily due to a 166 million gain recognized on the sale of a vf outlet ® location during 2015 and restructuring charges of 13 million in 2016 



there are three types of costs necessary to reconcile total coalition profit to consolidated income before income taxes these costs are i impairment of goodwill and intangible assets which is excluded from coalition profit because these costs are not part of the ongoing operations of the respective businesses ii interest expense net which is excluded from coalition profit because substantially all financing costs are managed at the corporate office and are not 

 

under the control of coalition management and iii corporate and other expenses discussed below which are excluded from coalition profit to the extent they are not allocated to the coalitions impairment of goodwill and intangible assets and net interest expense are discussed in the “consolidated statements of income” section and corporate and other expenses are discussed below 

vf corporation 2017 form 10k 27 

following is a summary of vf’s corporate and other expenses 



information systems and shared services 

these costs include management information systems and the centralized finance supply chain human resources directtoconsumer and customer management functions that support worldwide operations operating costs of information systems and shared services are charged to the coalitions based on utilization of those services costs to develop new computer applications are generally not allocated to the coalitions the increases in information systems and shared services costs in 2017  and 2016  primarily resulted from the costs associated with software system implementations and upgrades and other strategic projects 

corporate headquarters’ costs 

headquarters’ costs include compensation and benefits of corporate management and staff legal and professional fees and general and administrative expenses that have not been allocated to the coalitions the increase in corporate headquarters’ costs in 2017  compared to 2016  was primarily driven by higher strategic project costs an increase in cash and stockbased 

 

compensation expense and charitable contributions the increase in corporate headquarters’ costs in 2016  compared to 2015  was primarily driven by restructuring initiatives in the fourth quarter of 2016 and higher cash and stockbased compensation expense 

other 

this category includes i costs of corporate programs or corporatemanaged decisions that are not allocated to the coalitions ii costs of registering maintaining and enforcing certain of vf’s trademarks and iii miscellaneous consolidated costs the most significant of which is related to the expense of vf’s centrallymanaged us defined benefit pension plans the decrease in other expense in 2017  compared to 2016  and the increase in other expense in 2016  compared to 2015  was largely driven by a 509 million settlement charge in 2016 related to our us pension obligation resulting from offering former employees a onetime option to receive a lump sum distribution of their deferred vested benefits 



international revenues increased 12 in 2017  compared to an increase of 3 in 2016  foreign currency favorably impacted international revenue growth by 1 in 2017  and negatively impacted growth by 3 in 2016  revenues in europe increased 15 in 2017  reflecting operational growth and a 2 benefit from foreign currency in the asiapacific region revenues increased 6 

 

primarily driven by strong growth across the region particularly in china revenues in the americas nonus region grew 13 reflecting operational growth and a 1 benefit from foreign currency international revenues represented 41  and 40  of total vf revenues in 2017  and 2016  respectively 



directtoconsumer revenues grew 17 in 2017  compared to growth of 10 in 2016  reflecting growth in all regions and in nearly every brand with a retail format foreign currency favorably impacted directtoconsumer revenue growth by 1 in 2017  and negatively impacted directtoconsumer growth by 1 in 2016 the increase in directtoconsumer revenues in both periods was due to comparable store growth for locations open at least twelve 

 

 months at each reporting date and an expanding ecommerce business which grew 34 and 23 in 2017 and 2016 respectively vf opened 111  stores in 2017  bringing the total number of vfowned retail stores to 1518  at december 2017  directtoconsumer revenues were 32  of total vf revenues in 2017  compared to 29  in 2016

unless noted otherwise the discussion that follows relates to vfs businesses excluding the williamsondickie balances at december 2017 the discussion refers to significant changes in balances at december 2017  compared to december 2016  



 



vf corporation 2017 form 10k 29 



the financial condition of vf is reflected in the following 



for the ratio of debt to total capital debt is defined as shortterm and longterm borrowings and total capital is defined as debt plus stockholders’ equity the increase in the debt to total capital ratio at december 2017  compared to 2016  was primarily due to the increase in shortterm borrowings partially offset by the decrease in total longterm debt as discussed in “balance sheets” above in addition vf repurchased 12 billion of stock and paid 6847 million in dividends in 2017  which reduced stockholders’ equity by 19 billion stockholders equity was also reduced by 2378 million related to the cumulativeeffect adjustment upon the early adoption of the accounting standards update regarding intraentity 

 

asset transfers and the impact of the 4655 million provisional net charge related to the tax act 

vf’s primary source of liquidity is the strong annual cash flow provided by operating activities cash from operations is typically lower in the first half of the year as inventory builds to support peak sales periods in the second half of the year cash provided by operating activities in the second half of the year is substantially higher as inventories are sold and accounts receivable are collected additionally directtoconsumer sales are highest in the fourth quarter of the year 

in summary our cash flows were as follows 



the cash flows related to discontinued operations have not been segregated and are included in the consolidated statements of cash flows accordingly the information in the table above and cash flow discussion below include the results of continuing and discontinued operations 

cash provided by operating activities 

cash flow provided by operating activities is dependent on the level of net income adjustments to net income and changes in working capital cash provided by operating activities remained relatively flat as lower net income was offset by working capital changes primarily related to an increase in accrued income tax payable resulting from the tax act 

cash provided by operating activities increased 2770 million in 2016  primarily due to i a 2500 million discretionary contribution to the us qualified pension plan in 2015 that did not recur in 2016 and ii a decrease in net cash usage from working capital changes due in part to higher collections of accounts receivable and lower increases of inventory partially offset by higher levels of cash tax payments compared to 2015 

cash used by investing activities 

vf’s investing activities in 2017 related primarily to the williamsondickie acquisition of 7405 million net of cash received additionally the activities included 2150 million of proceeds from the sale of lsg which is 990 million higher than the proceeds received from the sale of the contemporary brands coalition in 2016 capital expenditures of 1696 million and software purchases of 652 million offset the proceeds received capital expenditures decreased 63 million compared to 2016 software purchases increased 210 million in 2017 primarily due to system implementations and investments in our digital platform 

vf’s investing activities in 2016 related primarily to capital expenditures of 1758 million and software purchases of 442 million partially offset by 1160 million of proceeds from the sale of its contemporary brands coalition capital expenditures 

 

decreased 787 million compared to 2015 primarily due to the purchase in 2015 of a headquarters building in the outdoor  action sports coalition software purchases decreased 191 million in 2016 primarily due to the completion of a major system implementation that incurred significant costs through the middle of 2015 

cash used by financing activities 

the increase in cash used by financing activities in 2017 compared to 2016 was driven by i no longterm debt borrowings in 2017 compared to 9518 million in proceeds during 2016 ii the 2500 million repayment of longterm debt discussed in balance sheets above iii a 1999 million increase in purchases of treasury stock and iv a 487 million increase in cash dividends paid these increases were partially offset by the 11 billion increase in net cash generated by shortterm borrowings as discussed in “balance sheets” above 

the increase in cash used by financing activities in 2016 compared to 2015 was driven by i the 8533 million net decrease in shortterm borrowings ii a 2678 million increase in purchases of treasury stock and iii a 707 million increase in cash dividends paid these increases were partially offset by 9518 million of proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt 

during 2017  2016  and 2015  vf purchased 222 million 159 million and 100 million shares respectively of its common stock in open market transactions the respective cost was 12 billion 10 billion and 7326 million with an average price per share of 5404 in 2017  6280 in 2016  and 7300 in 2015  

in march 2017 vfs board of directors approved a 50 billion share repurchase authorization replacing the 2013 authorization as of 

30          vf corporation 2017 form 10k 

the end of 2017  vf has purchased 140 million shares of its common stock in open market transactions at a total cost of 7621 million average price per share of 5446 under the new share repurchase authorization and had 42 billion remaining for future repurchases vf will continue to evaluate its use of capital giving first priority to business acquisitions and then to direct shareholder return in the form of dividends and share repurchases 

vf relied on continued strong cash generation to finance its ongoing operations in addition vf has significant liquidity from its available cash balances and credit facilities vf maintains a 225 billion senior unsecured revolving line of credit the “global credit facility” the global credit facility expires in april 2020 and vf may request two extensions of one year each subject to stated terms and conditions the global credit facility may be used to borrow funds in both us dollar and certain nonus dollar currencies and has a 500 million letter of credit sublimit in addition the global credit facility supports vf’s us commercial paper program for shortterm seasonal working capital requirements and general corporate purposes including share repurchases borrowings under the global credit facility are priced at a credit spread of 805 basis points over the appropriate libor benchmark for each currency vf is also required to pay a facility fee to the lenders currently equal to 70 basis points of the committed amount of the facility the credit spread and facility fee are subject to adjustment based on vf’s credit ratings 

vf has a commercial paper program that allows for borrowings up to 225 billion to the extent that it has borrowing capacity under the global credit facility commercial paper borrowings and standby letters of credit issued as of december 2017  were 7050 million and 153 million respectively leaving 15 billion available for borrowing against the global credit facility at december 2017  

vf has 2670 million of international lines of credit with various banks which are uncommitted and may be terminated at any time 

 

by either vf or the banks total outstanding balances under these arrangements were 244 million and 260 million at december 2017 and 2016 respectively borrowings under these arrangements had a weighted average interest rate of 99 and 72 at december 2017  and 2016  respectively excluding accepted letters of credit which are noninterest bearing to vf 

vf repaid 2500 million of 595 fixedrate notes on november 1 2017 using a combination of operating cash flows and commercial paper borrowings 

vf’s favorable credit agency ratings allow for access to additional liquidity at competitive rates at the end of 2017  vf’s longterm debt ratings were ‘a’ by standard  poor’s ratings services and ‘a3’ by moody’s investors service and commercial paper ratings by those rating agencies were ‘a1’ and ‘prime2’ respectively none of vf’s longterm debt agreements contain acceleration of maturity clauses based solely on changes in credit ratings however if there were a change in control of vf and as a result of the change in control the 2021 2023 and 2037 notes were rated below investment grade by recognized rating agencies vf would be obligated to repurchase the notes at 101 of the aggregate principal amount of notes repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest 

cash dividends totaled 172 per share in 2017  compared to 153 in 2016  and 133 in 2015  the dividend payout ratio was 962 of diluted earnings per share in 2017  599 in 2016  and 472 in 2015  based on the quarterly dividend in place the current indicated annual dividend rate for 2018 is 184 per share 

following is a summary of vf’s contractual obligations and commercial commitments at the end of 2017  that will require the use of funds 





 obligations under our qualified defined benefit pension plans and unfunded supplemental executive retirement plan are not included in the table above contractual cash obligations for these plans cannot be determined due to the number of assumptions required to estimate our future benefit obligations including return on assets discount rate and future compensation increases the liabilities associated with these plans are presented in note n to the consolidated financial statements we currently estimate that we will make contributions of approximately 351 million  to our pension plans during calendar year 2018 future contributions may differ from our planned contributions due to many factors including changes 

vf corporation 2017 form 10k 31 

in tax and other benefit laws changes to the plan or significant differences between expected and actual pension asset performance or interest rates 

 

vf had other financial commitments at the end of 2017  that are not included in the above table but may require the use of funds under certain circumstances 



 

management believes that vf’s cash balances and funds provided by operating activities as well as its global credit facility additional borrowing capacity and access to capital markets taken as a whole provide i adequate liquidity to meet all of its current and longterm obligations when due ii adequate liquidity to fund capital expenditures and to maintain the planned dividend payout rate and iii flexibility to meet investment opportunities that may arise 

vf does not participate in transactions with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships established to facilitate offbalance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes 



vf is exposed to risks in the ordinary course of business management regularly assesses and manages exposures to these risks through operating and financing activities and when appropriate by i taking advantage of natural hedges within vf ii purchasing insurance from commercial carriers or iii using derivative financial instruments some potential risks are discussed below 

insured risks 

vf is selfinsured for a significant portion of its employee medical workers’ compensation vehicle and general liability exposures vf purchases insurance from highlyrated commercial carriers to cover other risks including directors and officers property and umbrella and to establish stoploss limits on selfinsurance arrangements 

cash and equivalents risks 

vf had 5661 million  of cash and equivalents at the end of 2017  management continually monitors the credit ratings of the financial institutions with whom vf conducts business similarly management monitors the credit quality of cash equivalents 

defined benefit pension plan risks 

at the end of 2017  vf’s defined benefit pension plans were underfunded by a net total of 1342 million the underfunded status includes a 1620 million liability related to our unfunded us nonqualified defined benefit plan 485 million of net liabilities related to our nonus defined benefit plans and a 763 million asset related to our us qualified defined benefit 

 

plan vf has made significant cash contributions in recent years to improve the funded status of its plans including a discretionary contribution to the us qualified plan of 2500 million in 2015 vf will continue to evaluate the funded status and future funding requirements of these plans which depends in part on the future performance of the plans’ investment portfolios management believes that vf has sufficient liquidity to make any required contributions to the pension plans in future years 

vf’s reported earnings are subject to risks due to the volatility of its pension expense which has ranged in recent years from 348 million in 2017 to 1130 million in 2016 including the 509 million settlement charge discussed below these fluctuations are primarily due to varying amounts of actuarial gains and losses that are deferred and amortized to future years’ expense the assumptions that impact actuarial gains and losses include the rate of return on investments held by the pension plans the discount rate used to value participant liabilities and demographic characteristics of the participants 

during 2016 vf took an additional step in managing pension risk by offering former employees in the us qualified plan a onetime option to receive a distribution of their deferred vested benefits pursuant to which the plan paid 1971 million in lumpsum distributions to settle 2247 million of projected benefit obligations the company recorded 509 million in settlement charges during 2016 to recognize the related deferred actuarial losses in accumulated other comprehensive income loss no additional funding of the pension plan was required as all distributions were paid out of existing plan assets and the plan’s funded status remained materially unchanged as a result of this offer however assuming other key assumptions remain 

32          vf corporation 2017 form 10k 

unchanged pension expense will decrease in future years due to lower amortization of net deferred actuarial losses refer to note n to the consolidated financial statements and the “critical accounting policies and estimates” section below 

vf has taken a series of steps to manage the risk and volatility in the pension plans and their impact on the financial statements in 2005 vf’s us defined benefit plans were closed to new entrants which did not affect the benefits of existing plan participants at that date or their accrual of future benefits in more recent years the investment strategy of the us qualified plan has been revised to define dynamic asset allocation targets that are dependent upon changes in the plan’s funded status capital market expectations and risk tolerance additionally vf completed the onetime lumpsum offering noted above during 2016 which reduced the number of plan participants in the us qualified plan by 23  management will continue to evaluate actions that may help to reduce vf’s risks related to its defined benefit plans 

interest rate risks 

vf limits the risk of interest rate fluctuations by managing the mix of fixed and variable interest rate debt in addition vf may use derivative financial instruments to manage risk since all of vf’s longterm debt has fixed interest rates the exposure relates to changes in interest rates on variable rate shortterm borrowings which averaged approximately 870 million during 2017  however any change in interest rates would also affect interest income earned on vf’s cash equivalents based on the average amount of variable rate borrowings and cash equivalents during 2017  the effect of a hypothetical 1 increase in interest rates would be a decrease in reported net income of approximately 36 million 

foreign currency exchange rate risks 

vf is a global enterprise subject to the risk of foreign currency fluctuations approximately 41  of vf’s revenues in 2017  were generated in international markets most of vf’s foreign businesses operate in functional currencies other than the us dollar in periods where the us dollar strengthens relative to the euro or other foreign currencies where vf has operations there is a negative impact on vf’s operating results upon translation of those foreign operating results into the us dollar as discussed later in this section management hedges vf’s investments in certain foreign operations and foreign currency transactions 

the reported values of assets and liabilities in these foreign businesses are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for net advances to and investments in vf’s foreign businesses that are considered to be longterm the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on those longterm advances is deferred as a component of accumulated oci in stockholders’ equity the us dollar value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries fluctuates with changes in the underlying functional currencies on september 20 2016 vf issued €850 million of eurodenominated fixedrate notes which it has designated as a net investment hedge of vf’s investment in certain foreign operations because this debt qualified as a nonderivative hedging instrument foreign currency transaction gains or losses of the debt are deferred in the foreign currency translation and other component of accumulated oci as an offset to the foreign currency translation adjustments on the hedged investments any amounts deferred in accumulated oci will remain until the hedged investment is sold or substantially liquidated 

vf monitors net foreign currency market exposures and enters into derivative foreign currency contracts to hedge the effects of 

 

exchange rate fluctuations for a significant portion of forecasted foreign currency cash flows or specific foreign currency transactions relating to crossborder inventory purchases production costs product sales operating costs and intercompany royalty payments vf’s practice is to buy or sell foreign currency exchange contracts that cover up to 80 of foreign currency exposures for periods of up to 24 months currently vf uses only foreign exchange forward contracts but may use options or collars in the future this use of financial instruments allows management to reduce the overall exposure to risks from exchange rate fluctuations on vf’s cash flows and earnings since gains and losses on these contracts will offset losses and gains on the transactions being hedged 

for cash flow hedging contracts outstanding at the end of 2017  if there were a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates compared to rates at the end of 2017  it would result in a change in fair value of those contracts of approximately 230 million however any change in the fair value of the hedging contracts would be substantially offset by a change in the fair value of the underlying hedged exposure impacted by the currency rate changes 

counterparty risks 

vf is exposed to creditrelated losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to derivative hedging instruments to manage this risk we have established counterparty credit guidelines and only enter into derivative transactions with financial institutions that have ‘a minusa3’ investment grade credit ratings or better vf continually monitors the credit rating of and limits the amount hedged with each counterparty additionally management utilizes a portfolio of financial institutions to minimize exposure to potential counterparty defaults and adjusts positions as necessary vf also monitors counterparty risk for derivative contracts within the defined benefit pension plans 

commodity price risks 

vf is exposed to market risks for the pricing of cotton leather rubber wool and other materials which we either purchase directly or in a converted form such as fabric or shoe soles to manage risks of commodity price changes management negotiates prices in advance when possible vf has not historically managed commodity price exposures by using derivative instruments 

deferred compensation and related investment security risks 

vf has nonqualified deferred compensation plans in which liabilities to the plans’ participants are based on the market values of the participants’ selection of a hypothetical portfolio of investment funds including vf common stock vf invests in a portfolio of securities that substantially mirrors the participants’ investment selections the increases and decreases in deferred compensation liabilities except for the participants’ investment selections in vf common stock are substantially offset by corresponding increases and decreases in the market value of vf’s investments resulting in an insignificant net exposure to operating results and financial position the vf common stock is treated as treasury shares for financial reporting purposes so any gains or losses on those shares result in exposure to operating results and financial position as a result of the corresponding change in participant liabilities 

vf corporation 2017 form 10k 33 



vf has chosen accounting policies that management believes are appropriate to accurately and fairly report vf’s operating results and financial position in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us vf applies these accounting policies in a consistent manner significant accounting policies are summarized in note a to the consolidated financial statements 

the application of these accounting policies requires that vf make estimates and assumptions about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses contingent assets and liabilities and related disclosures these estimates assumptions and judgments are based on historical experience current trends and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis because vf’s business cycle is relatively short ie from the date 

 

that inventory is received until that inventory is sold and the trade receivable is collected actual results related to most estimates are known within a few months after any balance sheet date in addition vf may retain outside specialists to assist in valuations of business acquisitions impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets equity compensation pension benefits and selfinsured liabilities if actual results ultimately differ from previous estimates the revisions are included in results of operations when the actual amounts become known 

vf believes the following accounting policies involve the most significant management estimates assumptions and judgments used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements or are the most sensitive to change from outside factors the application of these critical accounting policies and estimates is discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors 



vf’s inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value cost includes all material labor and overhead costs incurred to manufacture or purchase the finished goods overhead allocated to manufactured product is based on the normal capacity of plants and does not include amounts related to idle capacity or abnormal production inefficiencies vf performs a detailed review at each business unit at least quarterly of all inventories on the basis of individual styles or individual stylesizecolor stock keeping units to identify slow moving or excess products discontinued and tobediscontinued products and offquality merchandise this review matches inventory on hand plus current production and purchase commitments with current and expected future sales orders management performs an evaluation to estimate net realizable value using a systematic and consistent methodology of forecasting future demand market conditions and selling prices 

 

less costs of disposal if the estimated net realizable value is less than cost vf provides an allowance to reflect the lower value of that inventory this methodology recognizes inventory exposures at the time such losses are evident rather than at the time goods are actually sold historically these estimates of future demand and selling prices have not varied significantly from actual results due to vf’s timely identification and ability to rapidly dispose of these distressed inventories 

existence of physical inventory is verified through periodic physical inventory counts and ongoing cycle counts at most locations throughout the year vf provides for estimated inventory losses that have likely occurred since the last physical inventory date historically physical inventory shrinkage has not been significant 



vf allocates the purchase price of an acquired business to the fair values of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed with any excess purchase price recorded as goodwill vf evaluates fair value at acquisition using three valuation techniques  the replacement cost market and income methods  and weights the valuation methods based on what is most appropriate in the circumstances the process of assigning fair values particularly to acquired intangible assets is highly subjective 

fair value for acquired intangible assets is generally based on the present value of expected cash flows indefinitelived trademark or trade name intangible assets collectively referred to herein as “trademarks” represent individually acquired trademarks some of which are registered in multiple countries definitelived customer relationship intangible assets are based on the value of relationships with wholesale customers at the time of acquisition definitelived license intangible assets relate to vfs licensing contracts with customers goodwill represents the excess of cost of an acquired business over the fair value of net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired and is assigned at the reporting unit level 

vf’s depreciation policies for property plant and equipment reflect judgments on their estimated economic lives and residual value 

 

if any vf’s amortization policies for definitelived intangible assets reflect judgments on the estimated amounts and duration of future cash flows expected to be generated by those assets in evaluating the amortizable life for customer relationship intangible assets management considers historical attrition patterns for various groups of customers for licenserelated intangible assets management considers historical trends and anticipated license renewal periods 

vf’s policy is to review property plant and equipment and definitelived intangible assets for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable vf tests for potential impairment at the asset or asset group level which is the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent vf measures recoverability of the carrying value of an asset or asset group by comparison to the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if the forecasted undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset are not expected to be adequate to recover the asset’s carrying value a fair value analysis must be performed and an impairment charge is recorded if there is an excess of the asset’s carrying value over its estimated fair value 

34          vf corporation 2017 form 10k 

when testing customer relationship intangible assets for potential impairment management considers historical customer attrition rates and projected revenues and profitability related to customers that existed at acquisition management uses the multiperiod excess earnings method which is a specific application of the discounted cash flow method to value customer relationship assets under this method vf calculates the present value of the aftertax cash flows expected to be generated by the customer relationship asset after deducting contributory asset charges 

vf’s policy is to evaluate indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill for possible impairment as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of such assets may be below their carrying amount as part of its annual impairment testing vf may elect to assess qualitative factors as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform quantitative impairment testing if management’s assessment of these qualitative factors indicates that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset or reporting unit is less than its carrying value then no further testing is required otherwise the intangible asset or reporting unit must be quantitatively tested for impairment 

an indefinitelived intangible asset is quantitatively tested for possible impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value fair value of an indefinitelived trademark is based on an income approach using the relieffromroyalty method under this method forecasted revenues for products sold with the trademark are assigned a royalty rate that would be charged to license the trademark in lieu of ownership and the estimated fair value is calculated as the present value of those forecasted royalties avoided by owning the trademark the appropriate discount rate is based on the reporting unit’s weighted average cost of capital “wacc” that considers market participant assumptions plus a spread that factors in the risk of the intangible asset the royalty rate is selected based on consideration of i royalty rates included in active license agreements if applicable ii royalty rates received by market participants in the apparel industry and iii the current performance of the reporting unit if the estimated fair value of the trademark intangible asset exceeds its carrying value there is no impairment charge if the estimated fair value of the trademark is less than its carrying value an impairment charge would be recognized for the difference 

goodwill is quantitatively evaluated for possible impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value reporting units are businesses with discrete financial information that is available and reviewed by coalition management 

for goodwill impairment testing vf estimates the fair value of a reporting unit using both incomebased and marketbased valuation methods the incomebased approach is based on the reporting unit’s forecasted future cash flows that are discounted to present value using the reporting unit’s wacc as discussed above for the marketbased approach management uses both the guideline company and similar transaction methods the guideline company method analyzes market multiples of revenues and earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” for a group of comparable public companies the market multiples used in the valuation are based on the relative strengths and weaknesses of the reporting unit compared to the selected guideline companies under the similar transactions method valuation multiples are calculated utilizing actual 

 

transaction prices and revenueebitda data from target companies deemed similar to the reporting unit 

based on the range of estimated fair values developed from the income and marketbased methods vf determines the estimated fair value for the reporting unit if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value the goodwill is not impaired and no further review is required however if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value vf calculates the impairment loss as the difference between the carrying value of the reporting unit and the estimated fair value 

the incomebased fair value methodology requires management’s assumptions and judgments regarding economic conditions in the markets in which vf operates and conditions in the capital markets many of which are outside of management’s control at the reporting unit level fair value estimation requires management’s assumptions and judgments regarding the effects of overall economic conditions on the specific reporting unit along with assessment of the reporting unit’s strategies and forecasts of future cash flows forecasts of individual reporting unit cash flows involve management’s estimates and assumptions regarding 

 under the marketbased fair value methodology judgment is required in evaluating market multiples and recent transactions management believes that the assumptions used for its impairment tests are representative of those that would be used by market participants performing similar valuations of vf’s reporting units 

2017  impairment testing 

during the third quarter of 2017  management determined that there had been a triggering event related to the nautica ® brand reporting unit that required an interim impairment analysis of the goodwill and trademark intangible assets vf early adopted the accounting standard update that permits a single step quantitative goodwill impairment test accordingly the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was compared to the carrying value and a 1047 million goodwill impairment was recorded in the third quarter of 2017 the nautica ® brand reporting unit has since been reported in discontinued operations 

management performed its annual goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment testing as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2017  management performed a qualitative analysis for all reporting units and trademark intangible assets as discussed below in the “ qualitative impairment analysis ” section 

vf corporation 2017 form 10k 35 

qualitative impairment analysis 

for all reporting units vf elected to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the goodwill and trademark intangible assets in those reporting units were impaired in this qualitative assessment vf considered relevant events and circumstances for each reporting unit including i current year results ii financial performance versus management’s annual and fiveyear strategic plans iii changes in the reporting unit carrying value since prior year iv industry and market conditions in which the reporting unit operates v macroeconomic conditions including discount rate changes and vi changes in products or services offered by the reporting unit if applicable performance in recent years was compared to forecasts included in prior valuations based on the results of the qualitative assessment vf concluded that it was not more likely than not that the carrying values of the goodwill and trademark intangible assets were greater than their fair values and that further quantitative testing was not necessary 

management’s use of estimates and assumptions 

management made its estimates based on information available as of the date of our assessment using assumptions we believe 

 

market participants would use in performing an independent valuation of the business it is possible that vf’s conclusions regarding impairment or recoverability of goodwill or intangible assets in any reporting unit could change in future periods there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions used in our goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing will prove to be accurate predictions of the future if for example i the businesses do not perform as projected ii overall economic conditions in 2018 or future years vary from current assumptions including changes in discount rates iii business conditions or strategies for a specific reporting unit change from current assumptions including loss of major customers iv investors require higher rates of return on equity investments in the marketplace or v enterprise values of comparable publicly traded companies or actual sales transactions of comparable companies were to decline resulting in lower multiples of revenues and ebitda 

a future impairment charge for goodwill or intangible assets could have a material effect on vf’s consolidated financial position and results of operations 



vf uses a lattice optionpricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees and nonemployee members of the board of directors vf believes that a lattice model provides a refined estimate of the fair value of options because it can incorporate i historical option exercise patterns and multiple assumptions about future option exercise patterns for each of several groups of option holders and ii inputs that vary over time such as assumptions for interest rates and volatility management performs an annual review of all assumptions employed in the valuation of option grants and believes they are reflective of the outstanding options and underlying common stock and of groups of option participants the lattice valuation incorporates the assumptions listed in note p to the consolidated financial statements 

one of the critical assumptions in the valuation process is estimating the expected average life of the options before they are exercised for each option grant vf estimated the expected average life based on evaluations of the historical and expected 

 

option exercise patterns for each of the groups of option holders that have historically exhibited different option exercise patterns these evaluations included i voluntary stock option exercise patterns based on a combination of changes in the price of vf common stock and periods of time that options are outstanding before exercise and ii involuntary exercise patterns resulting from turnover retirement and death 

volatility is another critical assumption requiring judgment management bases its estimates of future volatility on a combination of implied and historical volatility implied volatility is based on shortterm 6 to 9 months publicly traded nearthemoney options on vf common stock vf measures historical volatility over a tenyear period corresponding to the contractual term of the options using daily stock prices management’s assumption for valuation purposes is that expected volatility starts at a level equal to the implied volatility and then transitions to the historical volatility over the remainder of the tenyear option term 



vf sponsors a qualified defined benefit pension plan covering most fulltime us employees hired before 2005 and an unfunded supplemental defined benefit pension plan that provides benefits in excess of the limitations imposed by income tax regulations vf also sponsors certain nonus defined benefit pension plans the selection of actuarial assumptions for determining the projected pension benefit liabilities and annual pension expense is significant due to amounts involved and the long time period over which benefits are accrued and paid 

annually management reviews the principal economic actuarial assumptions summarized in note n to the consolidated financial statements and revises them as appropriate based on current rates and trends as of the valuation date vf also periodically reviews and revises as necessary other plan assumptions such as rates of compensation increases retirement termination disability and mortality vf believes the assumptions appropriately 

 

reflect the participants’ demographics and projected benefit obligations of the plans and result in the best estimate of the plans’ future experience actual results may vary from the actuarial assumptions used 

the below discussion of discount rate return on assets and mortality assumptions relates specifically to the us pension plans as they comprise approximately 91  of vf’s total defined benefit plan assets and approximately 90  of vf’s total projected benefit obligations of the combined us and international plans 

one of the critical assumptions used in the actuarial model is the discount rate which is used to estimate the present value of future cash outflows necessary to meet projected benefit obligations for the specific plan it is the estimated interest rate that vf could use to settle its projected benefit obligations at the valuation date the discount rate assumption is based on current market interest 

36          vf corporation 2017 form 10k 

rates vf selects a discount rate for each of the us pension plans by matching high quality corporate bond yields to the timing of projected benefit payments to participants in each plan vf uses the population of us corporate bonds rated ‘aa’ by moody’s investors service or standard  poor’s ratings services vf excludes the highest and lowest yielding bonds from this population of approximately 623 such bonds having at least i 500 million outstanding with 10 years or less to maturity or ii 50 million outstanding with 10 years or more to maturity the bonds must be noncallablenonputable unless makewhole provisions exist each plan’s projected benefit payments are matched to current market interest rates over the expected payment period to calculate an associated present value a single equivalent discount rate is then determined that produces the same present value the resulting discount rate is reflective of both the current interest rate environment and the plan’s distinct liability characteristics vf believes that those ‘aa’ rated issues meet the “high quality” intent of the applicable accounting standards and that the 2017 discount rates of 366 for the us qualified defined benefit pension plan and 370 for the unfunded supplemental defined benefit plan appropriately reflect current market conditions and the longterm nature of projected benefit payments to participants in the us pension plans these lower discount rates compared with the rates of 410 for the us qualified defined benefit pension plan and 414 for the unfunded supplemental defined benefit plan at the end of 2016 reflect the general decrease in yields of us government obligations and high quality corporate bonds during 2017 

in 2015 vf adopted the spot rate approach to measure service and interest costs under the spot rate approach the full yield curve is applied separately to cash flows for each projected benefit obligation service cost and interest cost for a more precise calculation 

another critical assumption of the actuarial model is the expected longterm rate of return on investments vf’s investment objective is to invest in a diversified portfolio of assets with an acceptable level of risk to maximize the longterm return while minimizing volatility in the value of plan assets relative to the value of plan liabilities these risks include market interest rate credit liquidity regulatory and foreign securities risks investment assets consist of us and international equity corporate and governmental fixedincome securities insurance contracts and alternative assets vf develops a projected rate of return for each of the investment asset classes based on many factors including historical and expected returns the estimated inflation rate the premium to be earned in excess of a riskfree return the premium for equity risk and the premium for longer duration fixedincome securities the weighted average projected longterm rates of return of the various assets held by the qualified plan provide the basis for the expected longterm rate of return actuarial assumption vf’s rate of return assumption was 600 in 2017 and 2016 and 625 in 2015 in recent years vf has altered the investment mix by i increasing the allocation to fixedincome investments and reducing the allocation to equity investments 

 

ii increasing the allocation in equities to more international investments and iii adding alternative assets as an asset class the changes in asset allocation are anticipated over time to reduce the yeartoyear variability of the us plan’s funded status and resulting pension expense management monitors the plan’s asset allocation to balance risk with anticipated investment returns in a given year based on an evaluation of market conditions and projected market returns vf will be using a rate of return assumption of 600 for the us qualified defined benefit pension plan for 2018 

we consistently review all of our demographic assumptions as part of the normal management of our defined benefit plans and update these assumptions as appropriate the company performed a demographic assumptions study in 2017 and updated the assumptions as necessary in the year end 2017 valuations 

in 2014 the society of actuaries soa issued new mortality tables rp2014 and mortality improvement scales mp2014 which reflect longer life expectancies than the previous tables in 2017 the soa issued updated scales mp2017 which were adjusted for characteristics of our planspecific populations and other data where appropriate in developing our best estimate of the expected mortality rates of plan participants in the us pension plans 

differences between actual results in a given year and the actuarially determined assumed results for that year eg investment performance discount rates and other assumptions do not affect that year’s pension expense but instead are deferred as unrecognized actuarial gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the consolidated balance sheet at the end of 2017 there were 4545 million  of pretax accumulated deferred actuarial losses plus 105 million  of pretax deferred prior service costs resulting in an aftertax amount of 2919 million in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the 2017 consolidated balance sheet these deferred losses will be amortized as a component of pension expense 

pension expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements was 348 million  in 2017 1130 million  in 2016 and 648 million  in 2015 pension expense for 2016 was higher as it included a 509 million settlement charge resulting from 9400 participants accepting a onetime option to receive a distribution of their deferred vested benefits refer to note n the cost of pension benefits actually earned each year by covered active employees commonly called “service cost” was 249 million  in 2017 258 million  in 2016 and 292 million  in 2015 pension expense was significantly lower in 2017 due to the 509 million settlement charge incurred in 2016 lower interest costs resulting from lower interest rates and lower amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses resulting from the 2016 onetime distribution looking forward vf expects pension expense for the next 12 months to decrease to approximately 204 million which reflects lower amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses and higher expected return on plan assets 

vf corporation 2017 form 10k 37 

the sensitivity of changes in actuarial assumptions on 2017  pension expense and on projected benefit obligations related to the us defined benefit pension plan at the end of 2017  all other factors being equal is illustrated by the following 



as discussed in the “risk management” section above vf has taken a series of steps to reduce volatility in the pension plans and their impact on the financial statements on a longerterm basis vf believes the yeartoyear variability of the retirement benefit expense should decrease 



as a global company vf is subject to income taxes and files income tax returns in over 100 us and foreign jurisdictions each year as discussed in note q to the consolidated financial statements vf has been granted a lower effective income tax rate on taxable earnings in certain foreign jurisdictions due to economic and political conditions tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change the company could be subject to changes in its tax rates the adoption of new us or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities vf makes an ongoing assessment to identify any significant exposure related to increases in tax rates in the jurisdictions in which vf operates 

in february 2015 the european union commission “eu” opened a state aid investigation into rulings granted to companies under belgium’s excess profit tax regime on january 11 2016 the eu announced its decision that these rulings were illegal and ordered that tax benefits granted under these rulings should be collected from the affected companies including vf the belgian government and vf have each filed appeals seeking annulment of the eu decision on january 10 2017 vf europe bvba received an assessment for €319 million tax and interest related to excess profits benefits received in prior years and remitted €319 million 339 million on january 13 2017 this was recorded as an income tax receivable in 2017 based on the expected success of the aforementioned requests for annulment if this matter is adversely resolved these amounts will not be collected by vf 

the calculation of income tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations which are subject to legal interpretation and significant management judgment vf’s income tax returns are regularly examined by federal state and foreign tax authorities and those audits may result in proposed adjustments vf has reviewed all issues raised upon examination as well as any exposure for issues that may be raised in future examinations vf has evaluated these potential issues under the “morelikelythannot” standard of the accounting literature a tax position is recognized if it meets this standard and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized such judgments and estimates may change based on audit settlements court cases and interpretation of tax laws and regulations income tax expense could be materially affected to the extent vf prevails in a tax position or when the statute of limitations expires for a tax position for which a liability for unrecognized tax benefits or valuation allowances have been established or to the extent vf is required 

 

to pay amounts greater than the established liability for unrecognized tax benefits vf does not currently anticipate any material impact on earnings from the ultimate resolution of income tax uncertainties there are no accruals for general or unknown tax expenses 

vf has 2860 million of gross deferred income tax assets related to operating loss and capital loss carryforwards and 2129 million of valuation allowances against those assets realization of deferred tax assets related to operating loss and capital loss carryforwards is dependent on future taxable income in specific jurisdictions the amount and timing of which are uncertain and on possible changes in tax laws if management believes that vf will not be able to generate sufficient taxable income or capital gains to offset losses during the carryforward periods vf records valuation allowances to reduce those deferred tax assets to amounts expected to be ultimately realized if in a future period management determines that the amount of deferred tax assets to be realized differs from the net recorded amount vf would record an adjustment to income tax expense in that future period 

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted the tax act the tax act included a broad range of complex provisions impacting the taxation of multinational companies generally accounting for the impacts of newly enacted tax legislation is required to be completed in the period of enactment however in response to the complexities and ambiguity surrounding the tax act the sec released staff accounting bulletin no 118 “sab 118” to provide companies with relief around the initial accounting for the tax act pursuant to sab 118 the sec has provided a oneyear measurement period for companies to analyze and finalize accounting for the tax act during the oneyear measurement period sab 118 allows companies to recognize provisional amounts when reasonable estimates can be made for the impacts resulting from the tax act vf will finalize accounting for the tax act during the oneyear measurement period and any adjustments to the provisional amounts will be included in income tax expense or benefit in the appropriate period in accordance with guidance provided by sab 118 

while our accounting for the tax act is not complete we have recognized a provisional charge of approximately 4655 million primarily comprised of approximately 5124 million related to the transition tax and approximately 895 million related to revaluing us deferred tax assets and liabilities using the new us corporate 

38          vf corporation 2017 form 10k 

tax rate of 21 other provisional charges netting to 426 million were primarily related to us federal and state tax on foreign income and dividends and establishing a deferred tax liability for foreign withholding taxes 

the tax act has significant complexity and our final tax liability may differ materially from provisional estimates due to additional guidance and regulations that may be issued by the us treasury department and the internal revenue service “irs” and for vf’s finalization of the relevant calculations required by the new tax legislation 

vf continues to analyze the provisions of the tax act which are effective after december 30 2017 including but not limited to the creation of a new minimum tax called the base erosion antiabuse 

 

tax “beat” a new provision that taxes us allocated expenses eg interest and general administrative expenses as well as certain global intangible lowtax income “gilti” from foreign operations a general elimination of us federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries a new limitation on deductible interest expense and limitations on the deductibility of certain employee compensation under generally accepted accounting principles in the us “gaap” companies are allowed to make an accounting policy election to either treat taxes resulting from gilti as a currentperiod expense when they are incurred or factor such amounts into the measurement of deferred taxes the company has not completed its analysis of the effects of the gilti provisions and will further consider the accounting policy election within the measurement period as provided under sab 118

the image business provides uniforms and career occupational apparel for workers in north america and internationally under the red kap ® brand premium workwear the bulwark ®  brand flame resistant and protective apparel primarily for the petrochemical utility and mining industries and the horace small ® brand apparel for law enforcement and public safety personnel products include a wide range of functionally designed shirts pants coveralls and outerwear image revenues are significantly correlated with the overall level of employment in the us 

approximately 66 of image revenues are from industrial laundries resellers and distributors that in turn supply customized workwear to employers for production service and whitecollar personnel since industrial laundries and distributors maintain minimal inventories of work clothes vf’s ability to offer rapid delivery of products in a broad range of sizes is an important advantage in this market our commitment to customer service supported by an automated central distribution center with several satellite locations enables customer orders to be filled within 24 hours of receipt as a result the red kap ®  and bulwark ®  brands have a strong presence in the reseller distributor market and are growing in the workwear retail market 

the image business also develops and manages uniform programs through customdesigned websites for major business customers and governmental organizations these websites provide the employees of our customers with the convenience of shopping for their work and career apparel via the internet 

in our lsg business we design and market sports apparel and fanwear under licenses granted by major sports leagues individual athletes and related organizations including major league baseball the national football league the major league baseball players association the national basketball association the national football league players association the national hockey league and certain nippon professional baseball league teams in addition the lsg business is a major supplier of licensed harleydavidson ® apparel to harleydavidson dealerships

directtoconsumer operations 

our directtoconsumer business includes fullprice stores outlet stores ecommerce and concession retail locations directtoconsumer revenues were 28  of total vf revenues in 2016 compared with 26  in 2015 

our fullprice stores allow us to display a brand’s full line of products with fixtures and imagery that support the brand’s positioning and promise to consumers these experiences provide high visibility for our brands and products and enable us to stay close to the needs and preferences of our consumers the complete and impactful presentation of products in our stores also helps to increase sellthrough of vf products at our wholesale customers due to increased brand awareness education and visibility vfoperated fullprice stores generally provide gross margins that are well above vf averages 

in addition vf operates outlet stores in both premium outlet malls and more traditional valuebased locations these outlet stores serve an important role in our overall inventory management and profitability by allowing vf to sell a significant portion of excess discontinued and outofseason products at better prices than otherwise available from outside parties while maintaining the integrity of our brands 

our growing global directtoconsumer operations included 1507  stores at the end of 2016 we operate retail store locations for the following brands vans ®  timberland ®  the north face ®  kipling ®  nautica ®  lee ®  lucy ®  napapijri ®  and wrangler ®  we also operate 80 vf outlet ® stores in the us that sell a broad selection of excess vf products as well as other nonvf products approximately 65 of vfoperated stores offer products at full price and the remainder are outlet locations approximately 60 of our stores are located in the americas region 55 in the us 25 in europe and 15 in the asia pacific region additionally we have approximately 1100 concession retail stores located principally in europe and asia

we expect our directtoconsumer business to continue growing at a faster pace than vf’s overall growth rate as we expand our ecommerce presence and open new stores we opened 155  stores during 2016 concentrating on the brands with the highest retail growth potential vans ®  the north face ®  and timberland ®  

in addition to our directtoconsumer operations our licensees distributors and other independent parties own and operate over 3000 partnership stores these are primarily monobrand retail locations selling vf products that have the appearance of vfoperated stores most of these partnership stores are located in europe and asia and are concentrated in the timberland ®  lee ®  the north face ®  vans ®  wrangler ®  nautica ®  kipling ®  and napapijri ® brands 

licensing arrangements 

as part of our strategy of expanding market penetration of vfowned brands we enter into licensing agreements with independent parties for specific apparel and complementary product categories when such arrangements provide more effective manufacturing distribution and marketing than could be achieved internally we provide support to these business partners and ensure the integrity of our brand names by taking an active role in the design quality control advertising marketing and distribution of licensed products 

licensing arrangements relate to a broad range of vf brands license agreements are for fixed terms of generally 3 to 5 years with conditional renewal options each licensee pays royalties to vf based on its sales of licensed products with most agreements providing for a minimum royalty requirement royalties generally range from 4 to 10 of the licensing partners’ net licensed products sales royalty income was 1167 million  in 2016  1  of total revenues primarily from the nautica ®  lee ®  

vans ®  timberland ®  and wrangler ® brands in addition licensees of our brands are generally required to spend from 1 to 3 of their net licensed product sales to advertise vf’s products in some cases these advertising amounts are remitted to vf for advertising on behalf of the licensees 

vf has also entered into license agreements to use trademarks owned by third parties we market apparel under licenses granted by major league baseball the national football league the major league baseball players association harleydavidson motor company inc the national basketball association the national football league players association the national hockey league certain nippon professional baseball teams and individual athletes and related organizations most of which contain minimum annual royalty and advertising requirements 

manufacturing sourcing and distribution 

product design and innovation including fit fabric finish and quality are important elements across our businesses these functions are performed by employees located in our global supply chain organization and our branded business units across the globe 

in addition to the design functions of each brand vf has three strategic global innovation centers that focus on technical and performance product development for apparel footwear and jeanswear the centers are staffed with dedicated scientists engineers and designers who combine proprietary insights with consumer needs and a deep understanding of technology and new materials these innovation centers are integral to vf’s longterm expectation to drive brand equity and sustained longterm growth 

vf’s centralized global supply chain organization is responsible for producing procuring and delivering products to our customers vf is highly skilled in managing the complexities associated with our global supply chain on an annual basis vf sources or produces approximately 523 million units spread across more than 30 brands our products are obtained from 27 vfoperated manufacturing facilities and approximately 1600  contractor manufacturing facilities in over 50 countries additionally we operate 33 distribution centers and 1507  retail stores managing this complexity is made possible by the use of a network of information systems for product development forecasting order management and warehouse management along with our core enterprise resource management platforms 

in 2016 22 of our units were manufactured in vfowned facilities and 78  were obtained from independent contractors products manufactured in vf facilities generally have a lower cost and shorter lead times than products procured from independent contractors products obtained from contractors in the western hemisphere generally have a higher cost than products obtained from contractors in asia however contracting in the western hemisphere gives us greater flexibility shorter lead times and allows for lower inventory levels this combination of vfowned and contracted production along with different geographic regions and cost structures provides a wellbalanced flexible approach to product sourcing we will continue to manage our supply chain from a global perspective and adjust as needed to changes in the global production environment 

vf operates manufacturing facilities in the us mexico central and south america the caribbean and europe a significant percentage of denim bottoms and occupational apparel is manufactured in these plants as well as a smaller percentage of footwear and other products for these owned production facilities we purchase raw materials from numerous us and international suppliers to meet our production needs raw materials include products made from cotton leather rubber wool synthetics and blends of cotton and synthetic yarn as well as thread and trim product identification buttons zippers snaps eyelets and laces in some instances we contract the sewing of vfowned raw materials into finished product with independent contractors manufacturing in the us includes all major league baseball uniforms along with screen printing and embroidery of jerseys tshirts and fleece products fixed price commitments for fabric and certain supplies are generally set on a quarterly basis for the next quarter’s purchases no single supplier represents more than 10 of our total cost of goods sold 

independent contractors generally own the raw materials and ship finished readyforsale products to vf these contractors are engaged through vf sourcing hubs in hong kong with satellite offices across asia and panama these hubs are responsible for managing the manufacturing and procurement of product supplier oversight product quality assurance sustainability within the supply chain responsible sourcing and transportation and shipping functions in addition our hubs leverage proprietary knowledge and technology to enable certain contractors to more effectively control costs and improve labor efficiency substantially all products in the outdoor  action sports and sportswear coalitions as well as a portion of products for our jeanswear and imagewear coalitions are obtained through these sourcing hubs 

management continually monitors political risks and developments related to duties tariffs and quotas we limit vf’s sourcing exposure through among other measures i diversifying geographies with a mix of vfoperated and contracted production ii shifting of production among countries and contractors iii sourcing production to merchandise categories where product is readily available and iv sourcing from countries with tariff preference and free trade agreements vf does not directly or indirectly source products from suppliers in countries that are prohibited by the us state department 

all vfoperated production facilities throughout the world as well as all independent contractor facilities that manufacture vf products must comply with vf’s global compliance principles these principles established in 1997 and consistent with international labor standards are a set of strict standards covering legal and ethical business practices workers’ ages work hours health and safety conditions environmental standards and compliance with local laws and regulations in addition our owned factories must also undergo certification by the independent nonprofit organization worldwide responsible accredited production “wrap” which promotes global ethics in manufacturing 

vf through its contractor monitoring program audits the activities of the independent businesses and contractors that produce vf products at locations across the globe each of the approximately 1600  independent contractor facilities including those serving our independent licensees must be precertified before producing vf products this precertification includes passing a factory inspection and signing a vf terms of engagement agreement we maintain an ongoing audit program to ensure compliance with these requirements by using dedicated internal staff and externally contracted firms additional information about vf’s code of business conduct global compliance principles terms of engagement factory compliance guidelines factory audit procedure and environmental compliance guidelines along with a global compliance report is available on the vf website at wwwvfccom 

vf did not experience difficulty in fulfilling its raw material and contracting production needs during 2016 absent any material changes vf believes it would be able to largely offset any increases in product costs through i the continuing shift in the mix of its business to higher margin brands geographies and channels of distribution ii increases in the prices of its products and iii cost reduction efforts the loss of any one supplier or contractor would not have a significant adverse effect on our business 

product is shipped from our independent suppliers and vfoperated manufacturing facilities to distribution centers around the world in some instances product is shipped directly to our customers most distribution centers are operated by vf and some support more than one brand a portion of our distribution needs are met by contract distribution centers 

seasonality 

vf’s quarterly operating results vary due to the seasonality of our individual businesses and are historically stronger in the second half of the year on a quarterly basis in 2016 revenues ranged from a low of 20 of full year revenues in the second quarter to a high of 29 in the third quarter while operating margin ranged from a low of 9 in the second quarter to a high of 18 in the third quarter this variation results primarily from the seasonal influences on revenues of our outdoor  action sports coalition where 19 of the coalition’s revenues occurred in the second quarter compared to 31 in the third quarter of 2016 with changes in our mix of business and the growth of our retail operations historical quarterly revenue and profit trends may not be indicative of future trends 

working capital requirements vary throughout the year working capital increases early in the year as inventory builds to support peak shipping periods and then moderates later in the year as those inventories are sold and accounts receivable are collected cash provided by operating activities is substantially higher in the second half of the year due to higher net income during that period and reduced working capital requirements particularly during the fourth quarter 

advertising customer support and community outreach 

during 2016 our advertising and promotion expense was 6764 million  representing 6  of total revenues we advertise in consumer and trade publications on radio and television and through digital initiatives including social media and mobile platforms on the internet we also participate in cooperative advertising on a shared cost basis with major retailers in print and digital media radio and television we sponsor sporting musical and special events as well as athletes and personalities who promote our products we employ marketing sciences to optimize the impact of advertising and promotional spending and to identify the types of spending that provide the greatest return on our marketing investments

 item 1a risk factors  

the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating vf’s business and the forwardlooking statements contained in this form 10k any of the following risks could materially adversely affect vf’s business its operating results and its financial condition 

vf’s revenues and profits depend on the level of consumer spending for apparel and footwear which is sensitive to global economic conditions and other factors a decline in consumer spending could have a material adverse effect on vf 

the success of vf’s business depends on consumer spending on apparel and footwear and there are a number of factors that influence consumer spending including actual and perceived economic conditions disposable consumer income interest rates consumer credit availability unemployment stock market performance weather conditions energy prices consumer discretionary spending patterns and tax rates in the international national regional and local markets where vf’s products are sold the current global economic environment is unpredictable and adverse economic trends or other factors could negatively impact the level of consumer spending and have a material adverse impact on vf 

the apparel and footwear industries are highly competitive and vf’s success depends on its ability to gauge consumer preferences and product trends and respond to constantly changing markets 

vf competes with numerous apparel and footwear brands and manufacturers competition is generally based upon brand name recognition price design product quality selection service and purchasing convenience some of our competitors are larger and have more resources than vf in some product categories and regions in addition vf competes directly with the private label brands of its wholesale customers vf’s ability to compete within the apparel and footwear industries depends on our ability to 

 failure to compete effectively or to keep pace with rapidly changing consumer preferences markets and product trends could have a material adverse effect on vf’s business financial condition and results of operations moreover there are significant shifts underway in the wholesale retail and ecommerce and retail store channels vf may not be able to manage its brands within and across channels sufficiently which could have a material adverse effect on vf’s business financial condition and results of operations 

vf’s results of operations could be materially harmed if we are unable to accurately forecast demand for our products 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully anticipate changing consumer preferences and product trends or economic conditions and as a result we may not successfully manage inventory levels to meet our future order requirements we often schedule internal production and place orders for products with independent manufacturers before our customers’ orders are firm if we fail to accurately forecast consumer demand we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of product required to meet the demand inventory levels in excess of consumer demand may result in inventory writedowns the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices or excess inventory held by our wholesale customers which could have a negative impact on future sales an adverse effect on the image and reputation of vf’s brands and negatively impact profitability on the other hand if we underestimate demand for our products our manufacturing facilities or thirdparty manufacturers may not be able to produce products to meet consumer requirements and this could result in delays in the shipment of products and lost revenues as well as damage to vf’s reputation and relationships these risks could have a material adverse effect on our brand image as well as our results of operations and financial condition 

vf’s business and the success of its products could be harmed if vf is unable to maintain the images of its brands 

vf’s success to date has been due in large part to the growth of its brands’ images and vf’s customers’ connection to its brands if we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to changing consumer demand the names and images of our brands may be impaired even if we react appropriately to changes in consumer preferences consumers may consider our brands’ images to be outdated or associate our brands with styles that are no longer popular in addition brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of qualities including merchandise quality and corporate integrity negative claims or publicity regarding vf its brands or its products including licensed products could adversely affect our reputation and sales regardless of whether such claims are accurate social media which accelerates the dissemination of information can increase the challenges of responding to negative claims in the past many apparel companies have experienced periods of rapid growth in sales and earnings followed by periods of declining sales and losses our businesses may be similarly affected in the future in addition we have sponsorship contracts with a number of athletes musicians and celebrities and feature those individuals in our advertising and marketing efforts actions taken by those individuals associated with our products could harm their reputations and adversely affect the images of our brands 

vf’s revenues and cash requirements are affected by the seasonal nature of its business 

vf’s business is increasingly seasonal with a higher proportion of revenues and operating cash flows generated during the second half of the fiscal year which includes the fall and holiday selling seasons poor sales in the second half of the fiscal year would have a material adverse effect on vf’s full year operating results and cause higher inventories in addition fluctuations in sales and operating income in any fiscal quarter are affected by the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales 

vf’s profitability may decline as a result of increasing pressure on margins 

the apparel industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors including intense competition consolidation in the retail industry pressure from retailers to reduce the costs of products and changes in consumer demand if these factors cause us to reduce our sales prices to retailers and consumers and we fail to sufficiently reduce our product costs or operating expenses vf’s profitability will decline this could have a material adverse effect on vf’s results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

vf may not succeed in its business strategy 

one of vf’s key strategic objectives is growth we seek to grow organically and through acquisitions we seek to grow by building new lifestyle brands expanding our share with winning customers stretching vf’s brands to new regions managing costs leveraging our supply chain and information technology capabilities across vf and expanding our directtoconsumer business including opening new stores and remodeling and expanding our existing stores and growing our ecommerce business we may not be able to grow our existing businesses we may have difficulty completing acquisitions and we may not be able to successfully integrate a newly acquired business or achieve the expected growth cost savings or synergies from such integration we may not be able to expand our market share with winning customers or our wholesale customers may encounter financial difficulties and thus reduce their purchases of vf products we may not be able to expand our brands geographically or achieve the expected results from our supply chain initiatives we may have difficulty recruiting developing or retaining qualified employees we may not be able to achieve our store and ecommerce expansion goals manage our growth effectively successfully integrate the planned new stores into our operations or operate our new remodeled and expanded stores profitably failure to implement our strategic objectives may have a material adverse effect on vf’s business 

vf relies significantly on information technology any inadequacy interruption integration failure or security failure of this technology could harm vf’s ability to effectively operate its business 

our ability to effectively manage and operate our business depends significantly on information technology systems we rely heavily on information technology to track sales and inventory and manage our supply chain we are also dependent on information technology including the internet for our directtoconsumer sales including our ecommerce operations and retail business credit card transaction authorization despite our preventative efforts our systems and those of our thirdparty service providers may be vulnerable to damage or interruption the failure of these systems to operate effectively problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems difficulty in integrating new systems or systems of acquired businesses or a breach in security of these systems could adversely impact the operations of vf’s business including management of inventory ordering and replenishment of products ecommerce operations retail business credit card transaction authorization and processing corporate email communications and our interaction with the public on social media 

vf is subject to data security and privacy risks that could negatively affect its results operations or reputation 

in the normal course of business we often collect retain and transmit certain sensitive and confidential customer information including credit card information over public networks there is a significant concern by consumers and employees over the security of personal information transmitted over the internet identity theft and user privacy despite the security measures we currently have in place our facilities and systems and those of our thirdparty service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches and vf and its customers could suffer harm if customer information were accessed by third parties due to a security failure in vf’s systems or one of our thirdparty service providers it could require significant expenditures to remediate any such failure or breach severely damage our reputation and our relationships with customers and expose us to risks of litigation and liability in addition as a result of recent security breaches at a number of prominent retailers the media and public scrutiny of information security and privacy has become more intense and the regulatory environment has become more uncertain as a result we may incur significant costs to comply with laws regarding the protection and unauthorized disclosure of personal information 

vf’s business is exposed to the risks of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations vf’s hedging strategies may not be effective in mitigating those risks 

a growing percentage of vf’s total revenues approximately 38  in 2016 is derived from markets outside the us vf’s international businesses operate in functional currencies other than the us dollar changes in currency exchange rates affect the us dollar value of the foreign currencydenominated amounts at which vf’s international businesses purchase products incur costs or sell products in addition for vf’s usbased businesses the majority of products are sourced from independent contractors or vf plants located in foreign countries as a result the cost of these products are affected by changes in the value of the relevant currencies furthermore much of vf’s licensing revenue is derived from sales in foreign currencies changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse impact on vf’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in accordance with our operating practices we hedge a significant portion of our foreign currency transaction exposures arising in the ordinary course of business to reduce risks in our cash flows and earnings our hedging strategy may not be effective in reducing all risks and no hedging strategy can completely insulate vf from foreign exchange risk we do not hedge foreign currency translation rate changes 

further our use of derivative financial instruments may expose vf to counterparty risks although vf only enters into hedging contracts with counterparties having investment grade credit ratings it is possible that the credit quality of a counterparty could be downgraded or a counterparty could default on its obligations which could have a material adverse impact on vf’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

there are risks associated with vf’s acquisitions 

any acquisitions or mergers by vf will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of companies these risks include among other things higher than anticipated acquisition costs and expenses the difficulty and expense of integrating the operations systems and personnel of the companies and the loss of key employees and customers as a result of changes in management in addition geographic distances may make integration of acquired businesses more difficult we may not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with any acquisitions 

our acquisitions may cause large onetime expenses or create goodwill or other intangible assets that could result in significant impairment charges in the future we also make certain estimates and assumptions in order to determine purchase price allocation and estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed if our estimates or assumptions used to value these assets and liabilities are not accurate we may be exposed to losses that may be material 

vf’s operations and earnings may be affected by legal regulatory political and economic risks 

our ability to maintain the current level of operations in our existing markets and to capitalize on growth in existing and new markets is subject to legal regulatory political and economic risks these include the burdens of complying with us and international laws and regulations unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs or other trade barriers 

we cannot predict any changes to us participation in or renegotiations of certain trade agreements or whether quotas duties taxes exchange controls or other restrictions will be imposed by the us the european union or other countries on the import or export of our products or what effect any of these actions would have on vf’s business financial condition or results of operations we cannot predict whether there might be changes in our ability to repatriate earnings or capital from international jurisdictions changes in regulatory geopolitical policies and other factors may adversely affect vf’s business or may require us to modify our current business practices while enactment of any such proposal is not certain if such changes were adopted our costs could increase which would reduce our earnings 

a significant portion of vf’s 2016 net income was earned in jurisdictions outside the us and most of our goods are manufactured outside the us vf is exposed to risks of changes in us policy for companies having business operations and manufacturing products outside the us there have been a number of proposed changes to us income tax laws including overall corporate and individual tax reform some of these tax law changes and tax reform proposals among other things consider accelerating the us taxability of nonus earnings or limiting foreign tax credits while enactment of any such proposal is not certain if new legislation were enacted it is possible our us income tax expense could increase which would reduce our earnings 

we may have additional tax liabilities 

as a global company we determine our income tax liability in various tax jurisdictions based on an analysis and interpretation of local tax laws and regulations this analysis requires a significant amount of judgment and estimation and is often based on various assumptions about the future actions of the local tax authorities these determinations are the subject of periodic us and international tax audits although we accrue for uncertain tax positions our accrual may be insufficient to satisfy unfavorable findings unfavorable audit findings and tax rulings may result in payment of taxes fines and penalties for prior periods and higher tax rates in future periods which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows further in an effort to deal with budget deficits governments around the world are focusing on increasing tax revenues through increased audits and potentially increased tax rates for corporations changes in tax law or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly affect the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements and could significantly impact our profitability 

vf’s balance sheet includes a significant amount of intangible assets and goodwill a decline in the fair value of an intangible asset or of a business unit could result in an asset impairment charge which would be recorded as an operating expense in vf’s consolidated statement of income and could be material 

vf’s policy is to evaluate indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill for possible impairment as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of such assets may be below their carrying amount in addition intangible assets that are being amortized are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable for these impairment tests we use various valuation methods to estimate the fair value of our business units and intangible assets if the fair value of an asset is less than its carrying value we would recognize an impairment charge for the difference 

it is possible that we could have an impairment charge for goodwill or trademark and trade name intangible assets in future periods if i overall economic conditions in 2017 or future years vary from our current assumptions ii business conditions or our strategies for a specific business unit change from our current assumptions iii investors require higher rates of return on equity investments in the marketplace or iv enterprise values of comparable publicly traded companies or of actual sales transactions of comparable companies were to decline resulting in lower comparable multiples of revenues and earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and accordingly lower implied values of goodwill and intangible assets a future impairment charge for goodwill or intangible assets could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

vf uses thirdparty suppliers and manufacturing facilities worldwide for a substantial portion of its raw materials and finished products which poses risks to vf’s business operations 

during fiscal 2016 approximately 78  of vf’s units were purchased from independent manufacturers primarily located in asia with substantially all of the remainder produced by vfowned and operated manufacturing facilities located in the us mexico central and south america the caribbean and europe any of the following could impact our ability to produce or deliver vf products or our cost of producing or delivering products and as a result our profitability 

 although no single supplier and no one country is critical to vf’s production needs if we were to lose a supplier it could result in interruption of finished goods shipments to vf cancellation of orders by customers and termination of relationships this along with the damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on vf’s revenues and consequently our results of operations 

our business is subject to national state and local laws and regulations for environmental employment privacy safety and other matters the costs of compliance with or the violation of such laws and regulations by vf or by independent suppliers who manufacture products for vf could have an adverse effect on our operations and cash flows as well as on our reputation 

our business is subject to comprehensive national state and local laws and regulations on a wide range of environmental consumer protection employment privacy safety and other matters vf could be adversely affected by costs of compliance with or violations of those laws and regulations in addition while we do not control their business practices we require thirdparty suppliers to operate in compliance with applicable laws rules and regulations regarding working conditions employment practices and environmental compliance the costs of products purchased by vf from independent contractors could increase due to the costs of compliance by those contractors 

failure by vf or its thirdparty suppliers to comply with such laws and regulations as well as with ethical social product labor and environmental standards or related political considerations could result in interruption of finished goods shipments to vf cancellation of orders by customers and termination of relationships if one of our independent contractors violates labor or other laws or implements labor or other business practices or takes other actions that are generally regarded as unethical it could jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions including boycotts that may reduce demand for vf’s merchandise damage to vf’s reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on vf’s results of operations financial condition and cash flows as well as require additional resources to rebuild vf’s reputation 

fluctuations in wage rates and the price availability and quality of raw materials and finished goods could increase costs 

fluctuations in the price availability and quality of fabrics leather or other raw materials used by vf in its manufactured products or of purchased finished goods could have a material adverse effect on vf’s cost of goods sold or its ability to meet its customers’ demands the prices we pay depend on demand and market prices for the raw materials used to produce them the price and availability of such raw materials may fluctuate significantly depending on many factors including general economic conditions and demand crop yields energy prices weather patterns and speculation in the commodities markets prices of purchased finished products also depend on wage rates in asia and other geographic areas where our independent contractors are located as well as freight costs from those regions in addition fluctuations in wage rates required by legal or industry standards could increase our costs in the future vf may not be able to offset cost increases with other cost reductions or efficiencies or to pass 

higher costs on to its customers this could have a material adverse effect on vf’s results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

we may be adversely affected by weather conditions 

our business is adversely affected by unseasonable weather conditions a significant portion of the sales of our products is dependent in part on the weather and is likely to decline in years in which weather conditions do not favor the use of these products periods of unseasonably warm weather in the fall or winter may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows inventory accumulation by our wholesale customers resulting from unseasonable weather in one season generally negatively affects orders in future seasons which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows abnormally harsh or inclement weather can also negatively impact retail traffic and consumer spending 

a substantial portion of vf’s revenues and gross profit is derived from a small number of large customers the loss of any of these customers or the inability of any of these customers to pay vf could substantially reduce vf’s revenues and profits 

a few of vf’s customers account for a significant portion of revenues sales to vf’s ten largest customers were 21  of total revenues in fiscal 2016 with our largest customer accounting for 9  of revenues sales to our customers are generally on a purchase order basis and not subject to longterm agreements a decision by any of vf’s major customers to significantly decrease the volume of products purchased from vf could substantially reduce revenues and have a material adverse effect on vf’s financial condition and results of operations moreover in recent years the retail industry has experienced consolidations restructurings reorganizations bankruptcies and other ownership changes in the future retailers are likely to further consolidate undergo restructurings or reorganizations or bankruptcies realign their affiliations or reposition their stores’ target markets these developments could result in a reduction in the number of stores that carry vf’s products an increase in ownership concentration within the retail industry an increase in credit exposure to vf or an increase in leverage by vf’s customers over their suppliers these changes could impact vf’s opportunities in the market and increase vf’s reliance on a smaller number of large customers 

further the global economy periodically experiences recessionary conditions with rising unemployment reduced availability of credit increased savings rates and declines in real estate and securities values these recessionary conditions could have a negative impact on retail sales of apparel and other consumer products the lower sales volumes along with the possibility of restrictions on access to the credit markets could result in our customers experiencing financial difficulties including store closures bankruptcies or liquidations this could result in higher credit risk to vf relating to receivables from our customers who are experiencing these financial difficulties if these developments occur our inability to shift sales to other customers or to collect on vf’s trade accounts receivable could have a material adverse effect on vf’s financial condition and results of operations 

our ability to obtain shortterm or longterm financing on favorable terms if needed could be adversely affected by geopolitical risk and volatility in the capital markets 

any disruption in the capital markets could limit the availability of funds or the ability or willingness of financial institutions to extend capital in the future this could adversely affect our liquidity and funding resources or significantly increase our cost of capital an inability to access capital and credit markets may have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

vf has a global revolving credit facility one or more of the participating banks may not be able to honor their commitments which could have an adverse effect on vf’s business 

vf has a 225 billion global revolving credit facility that expires in april 2020 if the financial markets return to recessionary conditions this could impair the ability of one or more of the banks participating in our credit agreements to honor their commitments this could have an adverse effect on our business if we were not able to replace those commitments or to locate other sources of liquidity on acceptable terms 

the loss of members of vf’s executive management and other key employees could have a material adverse effect on its business 

vf depends on the services and management experience of its executive officers and business leaders who have substantial experience and expertise in vf’s business the unexpected loss of services of one or more of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on vf our future success also depends on our ability to recruit retain and engage our personnel sufficiently competition for experienced and wellqualified personnel is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 

vf’s directtoconsumer business includes risks that could have an adverse effect on its results 

vf sells merchandise directtoconsumer through vfoperated stores and ecommerce sites its directtoconsumer business is subject to numerous risks that could have a material adverse effect on its results risks include but are not limited to a us or international resellers purchasing merchandise and reselling it overseas outside vf’s control b failure of the systems that operate the stores and websites and their related support systems including computer viruses theft of customer information privacy concerns telecommunication failures and electronic breakins and similar disruptions c credit card fraud and d risks related to vf’s directtoconsumer distribution centers and processes risks specific to vf’s ecommerce business also include a diversion of sales from vf stores or wholesale customers b difficulty in recreating the instore experience through direct channels c liability for online content d changing patterns of consumer behavior and e intense competition from online retailers vf’s failure to successfully respond to these risks might adversely affect sales in its ecommerce business as well as damage its reputation and brands 

our vfoperated stores and ecommerce business require substantial fixed investments in equipment and leasehold improvements information systems inventory and personnel we have entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space due to the high fixedcost structure associated with our directtoconsumer operations a decline in sales or the closure of or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs writeoffs of equipment and leasehold improvements and employeerelated costs 

vf’s net sales depend on the volume of traffic to its stores and the availability of suitable lease space 

a growing portion of our revenues are directtoconsumer sales through vfoperated stores in order to generate customer traffic we locate many of our stores in prominent locations within successful retail shopping centers or in fashionable shopping districts our stores benefit from the ability of the retail center and other attractions in an area to generate consumer traffic in the vicinity of our stores part of our future growth is significantly dependent on our ability to operate stores in desirable locations with capital investment and lease costs providing the opportunity to earn a reasonable return we cannot control the development of new shopping centers or districts the availability or cost of appropriate locations within existing or new shopping centers or districts competition with other retailers for prominent locations or the success of individual shopping centers or districts further if we are unable to renew or replace our existing store leases or enter into leases for new stores on favorable terms or if we violate the terms of our current leases our growth and profitability could be harmed all of these factors may impact our ability to meet our growth targets and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

vf may be unable to protect its trademarks and other intellectual property rights 

vf’s trademarks and other intellectual property rights are important to its success and its competitive position vf is susceptible to others copying its products and infringing its intellectual property rights especially with the shift in product mix to higher priced brands and innovative new products in recent years some of vf’s brands such as the north face ®  timberland ®  vans ®  jansport ®  nautica ®  wrangler ®  and lee ®  enjoy significant worldwide consumer recognition and the higher pricing of those products creates additional risk of counterfeiting and infringement 

vf’s trademarks trade names patents trade secrets and other intellectual property are important to vf’s success counterfeiting of vf’s products or infringement on its intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our brands and adversely affect vf’s revenues actions we have taken to establish and protect vf’s intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent copying of its products by others or to prevent others from seeking to invalidate its trademarks or block sales of vf’s products as a violation of the trademarks and intellectual property rights of others in addition unilateral actions in the us or other countries including changes to or the repeal of laws recognizing trademark or other intellectual property rights could have an impact on vf’s ability to enforce those rights 

the value of vf’s intellectual property could diminish if others assert rights in or ownership of trademarks and other intellectual property rights of vf or trademarks that are similar to vf’s trademarks or trademarks that vf licenses from others we may be unable to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction in some cases there may be trademark owners who have prior rights to vf’s trademarks because the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the us in other cases there may be holders who have prior rights to similar trademarks vf is from time to time involved in opposition and cancellation proceedings with respect to some of its intellectual property rights 

we may be subject to liability if third parties successfully claim that we infringe on their trademarks copyrights patents or other intellectual property rights defending infringement claims could be expensive and timeconsuming and might result in our entering into costly license agreements 

vf is subject to the risk that its licensees may not generate expected sales or maintain the value of vf’s brands 

during 2016 1167 million  of vf’s revenues were derived from licensing royalties although vf generally has significant control over its licensees’ products and advertising we rely on our licensees for among other things operational and financial controls over their businesses failure of our licensees to successfully market licensed products or our inability to replace existing licensees if necessary could adversely affect vf’s revenues both directly from reduced royalties received and indirectly from reduced sales of our other products risks are also associated with a licensee’s ability to 

 in addition vf relies on its licensees to help preserve the value of its brands although we attempt to protect vf’s brands through approval rights over design production processes quality packaging merchandising distribution advertising and promotion of our licensed products we cannot completely control the use of licensed vf brands by our licensees the misuse of a brand by a licensee could have a material adverse effect on that brand and on vf 

vf has entered into license agreements to use the trademarks of others loss of a license could have an adverse effect on vf’s operating results 

vf has entered into agreements to market products under licenses granted by third parties including major league baseball the national football league and harleydavidson motor company inc some of these licenses are for a short term and do not contain renewal options loss of a license which in certain cases could result in an impairment charge for related operating and intangible assets could have an adverse effect on vf’s operating results 

if vf encounters problems with its distribution system vf’s ability to deliver its products to the market could be adversely affected 

vf relies on owned or independentlyoperated distribution facilities to warehouse and ship product to its customers vf’s distribution system includes computercontrolled and automated equipment which may be subject to a number of risks related to security or computer viruses the proper operation of software and hardware power interruptions or other system failures because substantially all of vf’s products are distributed from a relatively small number of locations vf’s operations could also be interrupted by earthquakes floods fires or other natural disasters affecting its distribution centers we maintain business interruption insurance but it may not adequately protect vf from the adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in vf’s distribution facilities such as the longterm loss of customers or an erosion of brand image in addition vf’s distribution capacity is dependent on the timely performance of services by third parties including the transportation of product to and from its distribution facilities if we encounter problems with our distribution system our ability to meet customer expectations manage inventory complete sales and achieve operating efficiencies could be materially adversely affected 

volatility in securities markets interest rates and other economic factors could substantially increase vf’s defined benefit pension costs 

vf currently has obligations under its defined benefit pension plans the funded status of the pension plans is dependent on many factors including returns on investment assets and the discount rate used to determine pension obligations unfavorable impacts from returns on plan assets decreases in discount rates changes in plan demographics or revisions in the applicable laws or regulations could materially change the timing and amount of pension funding requirements which could reduce cash available for vf’s business 

vf’s operating performance also may be negatively impacted by the amount of expense recorded for its pension plans pension expense is calculated using actuarial valuations that incorporate assumptions and estimates about financial market economic and demographic conditions differences between estimated and actual results give rise to gains and losses that are deferred and amortized as part of future pension expense which can create volatility that adversely impacts vf’s future operating results

highlights of 2016 

in light of the 2016 divestiture of our contemporary brands coalition and the ongoing strategic review of our licensed sports group business we reassessed how to best optimize and leverage vf’s strengths to create a more efficient and agile organization as part of this assessment the company approved restructuring initiatives in the fourth quarter of 2016 to realign our cost structure vf recognized 581 million in expense related to severance asset writedowns and other costs associated with these restructuring initiatives as part of this assessment management made a strategic decision to merge the lucy ® brand into the   north face ®  brand during 2017 and incurred 796 million of intangible asset and goodwill impairment charges associated with the decision severance and other asset impairment charges associated with this decision are included in the restructuring charge noted above additionally vf took steps to reduce the size and potential future volatility of its us pension plan obligation and 

offered former employees a onetime option to receive a lump sum distribution of their deferred vested benefits the payment of which resulted in a pension settlement charge of 509 million 

despite an inconsistent retail environment and the above strategic actions which reduced net income by 1392 million the company delivered the following results in 2016 

 analysis of results of operations 

consolidated statements of income 

the following table presents a summary of the changes in total revenues during the last two years   



2016 compared to 2015 

vf reported revenues in 2016 that were in line with 2015 revenues the 2016 results were primarily attributable to a 2 increase in both the outdoor  action sports and imagewear coalitions and continued strength in the international and directtoconsumer businesses which offset foreign currency headwinds of 1 and softness in our jeanswear and sportswear coalitions excluding the negative impact from foreign currency sales grew in every international region around the world in 2016 

2015 compared to 2014 

vf reported revenue growth of 1 in 2015 primarily attributable to a 3 increase in the outdoor  action sports coalition and continued strength in the international and directtoconsumer businesses partially offset by a negative 5 impact from foreign currency excluding the negative impact from foreign currency sales grew in every region around the world in 2015 additionally 2015 revenue growth was negatively impacted by unseasonably warm weather in the fourth quarter a softer retail environment and the 53 rd  week in 2014 the extra week in 2014 negatively impacted 2015 revenue growth comparisons by 1 

vf’s most significant foreign currency exposure relates to business conducted in eurobased countries however vf conducts business in other developed and emerging markets around the world with exposure to foreign currencies other than the euro the strengthening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies negatively impacted revenue comparisons in 2016 and 2015 as discussed above 

additional details on revenues are provided in the section titled “information by business segment” 

the following table presents the percentage relationship to total revenues for components of the consolidated statements of income 



2016 compared to 2015 

gross margin improved 20 basis points to 484  in 2016 compared to 482  in 2015 reflecting a 120 basis point benefit from pricing lower product costs and a mix shift toward higher margin businesses which was partially offset by a 20 basis point impact from restructuring activities and a negative 80 basis point impact from foreign currency 

selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased 200 basis points in 2016 compared to 2015 this increase is primarily due to restructuring initiatives of 348 million a pension settlement charge of 509 million investments in our key growth priorities which include directtoconsumer product innovation demand creation and technology initiatives and the benefit of a 166 million gain on the sale of a vf outlet ®  location in 2015 see additional discussion of the pension settlement charge in note m to the consolidated financial statements and the “critical accounting policies and estimates” section below 

as a result of management’s decision to merge the lucy ®  brand into the north face ®   brand   vf recorded a 796 million noncash impairment charge to writeoff the goodwill and intangible assets of the lucy ®  reporting unit during the fourth quarter of 2016 for additional information refer to notes f g and t to the consolidated financial statements and the “critical accounting policies and estimates” section below 

in 2016 operating margin decreased 240 basis points to 125  from 149  in 2015 the decrease in operating margin reflects a 150 basis point decrease from goodwill and intangible asset impairment restructuring and pension settlement charges that did not occur in 2015 a negative 50 basis point impact from changes in foreign currency and investments in our key growth priorities which include directtoconsumer product innovation demand creation and technology initiatives 

net interest expense increased 40 million to 856 million in 2016 the increase in net interest expense was primarily due to higher interest rates on shortterm borrowings and an increase in longterm debt due to the issuance of €850 million eurodenominated 0625 fixedrate notes in september 2016 

outstanding interestbearing debt averaged 26 billion for 2016 compared to 24 billion for 2015 with shortterm borrowings representing 37 and 42 of average debt outstanding for the respective years the weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt was 35 in both 2016 and 2015 as the impact of the issuance of €850 million eurodenominated 0625 fixedrate notes in september of 2016 was offset by higher shortterm debt rates 

other income expense primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses the funding fee charged on the sale of our trade receivables and nonoperating gains and losses other income expense netted to income of 20 million  and 10 million  in 2016 and 2015 respectively 

the effective income tax rate was 172 in 2016 compared to 230 in 2015 the 2016 tax rate included a net discrete tax benefit of 445 million which included 293 million of tax benefits related to the early adoption of the accounting standards update on stock compensation 132 million of net tax benefits related to the realization of previously unrecognized tax benefits and interest and 41 million of discrete tax expense related to the effects of tax rate changes the 445 million net discrete tax benefit in 2016 reduced the effective income tax rate by 31 compared to a 26 impact of discrete items in 2015 without discrete items the effective tax rate during 2016 decreased by approximately 53 primarily due to i a higher percentage of foreign earnings in 2016 ii the comparative impact of tax benefits recorded in 2016 related to the utilization of foreign tax attributes iii the full year benefits of the federal research tax credit and other incentives signed into law in december 2015 and iv the negative tax impact related to the 2016 goodwill impairment the international effective tax rate was 107 and 123 for 2016 and 2015 respectively vf expects the 2017 annual tax rate to approximate 20 

as a result of the above net income in 2016 was 12 billion   278  per diluted share compared to 13 billion   304  per diluted share in 2015 the decrease in diluted earnings per share in 2016 compared to 2015 reflects goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges 015 per share restructuring charges 010 per share and a pension settlement charge 007 per share 

2015 compared to 2014 

in 2015 gross margin declined 40 basis points primarily due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations which negatively impacted gross margin by 70 basis points in 2015 compared to 2014 excluding this impact gross margin improved 30 basis points in 2015 due to lower product costs and the continued shift in our revenue mix towards higher margin businesses including outdoor  action sports directtoconsumer and international partially offset by aggressive efforts to manage inventory levels 

selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased 10 basis points compared to 2014 this decrease was primarily due to lower incentive compensation leverage of operating expenses on higher revenues and the benefit from a 166 million gain on the sale of a vf outlet ®  location in 2015 partially offset by increased investments in our directtoconsumer businesses and global product development which includes our strategic innovation centers 

in 2015 operating margin decreased 20 basis points to 149 from 151 in 2014 the decrease in operating margin reflects lower gross margin due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

in 2015 net interest expense increased 24 million to 816 million primarily due to higher average levels of shortterm borrowings 

outstanding interestbearing debt averaged 24 billion for 2015 and 18 billion for 2014 with shortterm borrowings representing 42 and 22 of average debt outstanding for the respective years the weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt was 35 in 2015 and 46 in 2014 the weighted average interest rate decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to the increase in average levels of shortterm borrowings at lower interest rates 

other income expense netted to income of 10 million  in 2015 compared to expense of 55 million  in 2014 the income in 2015 was due primarily to net foreign currency exchange gains compared to net foreign currency losses in 2014 

the effective income tax rate was 230 in 2015 compared to 225 in 2014 the 2015 tax rate included a net discrete tax benefit of 435 million which included 362 million of tax benefits related to the settlement of tax audits and 41 million related to the retroactive impact of the protecting americans from tax hikes “path” act of 2015 as discussed below the 435 million tax benefit in 2015 reduced the effective income tax rate by 26 compared to a 08 impact of discrete items in 2014 without discrete items the effective tax rate during 2015 increased by approximately 23 primarily due to i a lower percentage of foreign earnings in 2015 reflecting the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates ii the expiration of a favorable tax ruling in a foreign jurisdiction at the end of fiscal 2014 and iii the comparative impact of tax benefits recorded in 2014 related to the utilization of foreign tax attributes the international effective tax rate was 123 and 126 for 2015 and 2014 respectively 

the path act of 2015 signed into law in december 2015 permanently extended the us federal research tax credit and extended certain tax credits and other incentives the path act was retroactive to january 1 2015 and the impact was considered a discrete tax benefit when recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015 

as a result of the above net income in 2015 was 13 billion   304  per diluted share in 2015 compared to 13 billion   302  per diluted share in 2014 the increase in diluted earnings per share in 2015 compared to 2014 was the result of improved operating performance partially offset by the negative impact from foreign currency

operating margin increased 40 basis points in 2015 over 2014 primarily driven by a shift in business mix to the higher margin kipling ®  brand business and lower levels of promotional activity in the wholesale channel for the nautica ®  brand partially offset by reduced expense leverage on lower sales volume and increased investments in directtoconsumer businesses 

other 



 calculation not meaningful   

vf outlet ®  stores in the us sell both vf and nonvf products revenues and profits of vf products sold in these stores are reported as part of the operating results of the applicable coalition while revenues and profits of nonvf products are reported in this “other” category the decrease in profit and operating margin in 2016 was primarily due to a 166 million gain recognized on the sale of a vf outlet ® location during 2015 and restructuring charges of 13 million in 2016 

reconciliation of coalition profit to consolidated income before income taxes 

there are three types of costs necessary to reconcile total coalition profit to consolidated income before income taxes these costs are i impairment of goodwill and intangible assets which is excluded from coalition profit because these costs are not part of the ongoing operations of the respective businesses ii interest expense net which is excluded from coalition profit because substantially all financing costs are managed at the corporate office and are not under the control of coalition management and iii corporate and other expenses discussed below which are excluded from coalition profit to the extent they are not allocated to the coalitions impairment of goodwill and intangible assets and net interest expense are discussed in the “consolidated statements of income” section and corporate and other expenses are discussed below 

following is a summary of vf’s corporate and other expenses 

  



information systems and shared services 

these costs include management information systems and the centralized finance supply chain human resources directtoconsumer and customer management functions that support worldwide operations operating costs of information systems and shared services are charged to the coalitions based on utilization of those services costs to develop new computer applications are generally not allocated to the coalitions the increases in information systems and shared services costs in 2016 and 2015 resulted from the costs associated with software system implementations and upgrades 

corporate headquarters’ costs 

headquarters’ costs include compensation and benefits of corporate management and staff legal and professional fees and general and administrative expenses that have not been allocated to the coalitions the increase in corporate headquarters’ costs in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily driven by restructuring initiatives in the fourth quarter of 2016 and higher cash and stockbased compensation expense the decrease in corporate headquarters’ costs in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily driven by decreases in cash and stockbased compensation expense resulting from lower corporate performance versus established goals partially offset by additional investments in our global innovation centers 

other 

this category includes i costs of corporate programs or corporatemanaged decisions that are not allocated to the coalitions ii costs of registering maintaining and enforcing certain of vf’s trademarks and iii miscellaneous consolidated costs the most significant of which is related to the expense of vf’s centrallymanaged us defined benefit pension plans the increase in other expense in 2016 compared to 2015 was largely driven by a 509 million settlement charge related to our us pension obligation resulting from offering former employees a onetime option to receive a lump sum distribution of their deferred vested benefits the decrease in other expense in 2015 compared to 2014 was driven by a decrease in the value of vf’s deferred compensation liability partially offset by higher pension expense 

international operations 

international revenues increased 4 in 2016 compared to a decline of 4 in 2015 foreign currency negatively impacted international revenue growth by 2 in 2016 and 13 in 2015 revenues in europe increased 5 in 2016 reflecting operational growth and a 1 benefit from foreign currency in the asia pacific region revenues increased 3 primarily driven by strong growth across the region partially offset by negative foreign currency impacts of 3 revenues in the americas nonus region grew 2 as operational growth was largely offset by weakening currencies in the region relative to the us dollar that negatively impacted growth by 9 international revenues represented 38  and 37  of total vf revenues in 2016 and 2015 respectively 

directtoconsumer operations 

directtoconsumer revenues grew 8 in 2016 compared to growth of 2 in 2015 reflecting growth in all regions and in nearly every brand the directtoconsumer revenue increase in 2016 was partially offset by a negative 1 impact from foreign currency as flat foreign currency rates in europe were offset by unfavorable rates primarily in asia and the americas the increases in directtoconsumer revenues in both periods were due to strength in the outdoor  action sports coalition and international business new store openings and an expanding ecommerce business partially offset by declines in the sportswear coalition vf opened 155  stores in 2016 bringing the total number of vfowned retail stores to 1507  at december 2016 directtoconsumer revenues were 28  of total vf revenues in 2016 compared to 26  in 2015 

analysis of financial condition 

balance sheets 

the following discussion refers to significant changes in balances at december 2016 compared to december 2015 



liquidity and cash flows 

the financial condition of vf is reflected in the following 



for the ratio of debt to total capital debt is defined as shortterm and longterm borrowings and total capital is defined as debt plus stockholders’ equity the increase in the debt to total capital ratio at december 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to the increase in longterm borrowings partially offset by the decrease in shortterm borrowings as explained above in addition vf repurchased 10 billion of stock and paid 6360 million in dividends in 2016 which reduced stockholders’ equity by 16 billion 

vf’s primary source of liquidity is the strong annual cash flow provided by operating activities cash from operations is typically lower in the first half of the year as inventory builds to support peak sales periods in the second half of the year cash provided by operating activities in the second half of the year is substantially higher as inventories are sold and accounts receivable are collected additionally directtoconsumer sales are highest in the fourth quarter of the year 

in summary our cash flows were as follows 



 cash provided by operating activities 

cash flow provided by operating activities is dependent on the level of net income adjustments to net income and changes in working capital cash provided by operating activities increased 2745 million in 2016 primarily due to i a 2500 million discretionary contribution to the us qualified pension plan in 2015 that did not recur in 2016 and ii a decrease in net cash usage from working capital changes due in part to higher collections of accounts receivable and lower increases of inventory partially offset by higher levels of cash tax payments compared to 2015 

cash provided by operating activities declined 5587 million in 2015 primarily due to i a 2500 million discretionary contribution to the us qualified pension plan in 2015 ii an increase in net cash usage from working capital changes due in part to higher inventory levels at the end of 2015 iii lower cash collections in 2015 due to the extra week in 2014 and iv the negative impact of foreign currency exchange 

cash used by investing activities 

vf’s investing activities in 2016 related primarily to capital expenditures of 1758 million and software purchases of 442 million partially offset by 1160 million of proceeds from the sale of its contemporary brands coalition capital expenditures decreased 787 million compared to 2015 primarily due to the purchase in 2015 of a headquarters building in the outdoor  action sports coalition software purchases decreased 191 million in 2016 primarily due to the completion of a major system implementation that incurred significant costs through the middle of 2015 

vf’s investing activities in 2015 related primarily to capital expenditures of 2545 million and software purchases of 633 million partially offset by 167 million of proceeds from the sale of a vf outlet ®  location capital expenditures increased 204 million compared to 2014 primarily due to the purchase of a headquarters building in the outdoor  action sports coalition software purchases decreased 47 million in 2015 primarily due to the completion of a major system implementation that incurred significant costs throughout 2014 and through the middle of 2015 the decrease in software purchases was partially offset by the timing of payments to vendors as a significant amount of payments for software purchases near the end of 2014 were made in early 2015 

cash used by financing activities 

the increase in cash used by financing activities in 2016 compared to 2015 was driven by i the 8533 million net decrease in shortterm borrowings discussed in “balance sheets” above ii a 2678 million increase in purchases of treasury stock and iii a 707 million increase in cash dividends paid these increases were partially offset by 9518 million of proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt as discussed in “balance sheets” above 

the decrease in cash used by financing activities in 2015 compared to 2014 was driven by the 4275 million increase in shortterm borrowings partially offset by an increase of 863 million in cash dividends paid in 2015 

during 2016 2015 and 2014 vf purchased 159 million 100 million and 120 million shares respectively of its common stock in open market transactions the respective cost was 10 billion 7326 million and 7278 million with an average price per share of 6280 in 2016 7300 in 2015 and 6046 in 2014 

as of the end of 2016 the company had 148 million shares remaining under its current share repurchase program authorized by vf’s board of directors vf will continue to evaluate its use of capital giving first priority to business acquisitions and then to direct shareholder return in the form of dividends and share repurchases 

in june 2016 vf entered an accession agreement to increase the existing 175 billion senior unsecured revolving line of credit the “global credit facility” to 225 billion the global credit facility expires in april 2020 and vf may request two extensions of one year each subject to stated terms and conditions the global credit facility may be used to borrow funds in both us dollar and certain nonus dollar currencies and has a 500 million letter of credit sublimit in addition the global credit facility supports vf’s us commercial paper program for shortterm seasonal working capital requirements and general corporate purposes borrowings under the global credit facility are priced at a credit spread of 805 basis points over the appropriate libor benchmark for each currency vf is also required to pay a facility fee to the lenders currently equal to 70 basis points of the committed amount of the facility the credit spread and facility fee are subject to adjustment based on vf’s credit ratings 

vf has a commercial paper program that allows for borrowings up to 225 billion to the extent it has borrowing capacity under the global credit facility as of december 2016 there were no outstanding commercial paper borrowings the global credit facility also had 161 million of outstanding standby letters of credit issued on behalf of vf as of december 2016 leaving 223 billion available for borrowing against this facility 

vf has 1201 million of international lines of credit with various banks which are uncommitted and may be terminated at any time by either vf or the banks borrowings under these arrangements had a weighted average interest rate of 72 and 60 at december 2016 and 2015 respectively excluding accepted letters of credit which are noninterest bearing to vf total outstanding balances under these arrangements were 260 million and 266 million at december 2016 and 2015 respectively 

on september 20 2016 vf issued €8500 million of eurodenominated 0625 fixedrate notes maturing in september 2023 the proceeds were used for working capital and general corporate purposes including repayment of outstanding indebtedness under the existing commercial paper program the cash proceeds from the notes were 9518 million net of original issue discount interest expense on these notes is recorded at an effective annual interest rate of 0712 which includes amortization of original issue discount and debt issuance costs 

vf has 2500 million of 595 fixedrate notes coming due in october of 2017 the repayment of these notes will likely be funded using a combination of operating cash flows and commercial paper borrowings 

vf’s favorable credit agency ratings allow for access to additional liquidity at competitive rates at the end of 2016 vf’s longterm debt ratings were ‘a’ by standard  poor’s ratings services and ‘a3’ by moody’s investors service and commercial paper ratings by those rating agencies were ‘a1’ and ‘prime2’ respectively none of vf’s longterm debt agreements contain acceleration of maturity clauses based solely on changes in credit ratings however if there were a change in control of vf and as a result of the change in control the 2017 2021 2023 and 2037 notes were rated below investment grade by recognized rating agencies vf would be obligated to repurchase the notes at 101 of the aggregate principal amount of notes repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest 

cash dividends totaled 153 per share in 2016 compared to 133 in 2015 and 11075 in 2014 the dividend payout ratio was 551 of diluted earnings per share in 2016 437 in 2015 and 367 in 2014 based on the quarterly dividend in place the current indicated annual dividend rate for 2017 is 168 per share 

as of december 2016 approximately 4441 million of cash and shortterm investments was held by international subsidiaries whose undistributed earnings are considered permanently reinvested vf’s intent is to reinvest these funds in international operations if management decides at a later date to repatriate these funds to the us vf would be required to provide taxes on these amounts based on applicable us tax rates net of foreign taxes already paid 

following is a summary of vf’s contractual obligations and commercial commitments at the end of 2016 that will require the use of funds 





 obligations under our qualified defined benefit pension plans and unfunded supplemental executive retirement plan are not included in the table above contractual cash obligations for these plans cannot be determined due to the number of assumptions required to estimate our future benefit obligations including return on assets discount rate and future compensation increases the liabilities associated with these plans are presented in note m to the consolidated financial statements we currently estimate that we will make contributions of approximately 170 million to our pension plans in 2017 future contributions may differ from our planned contributions due to many factors including changes in tax and other benefit laws or significant differences between expected and actual pension asset performance or interest rates 

 vf had other financial commitments at the end of 2016 that are not included in the above table but may require the use of funds under certain circumstances 

 management believes that vf’s cash balances and funds provided by operating activities as well as its global credit facility additional borrowing capacity and access to capital markets taken as a whole provide i adequate liquidity to meet all of its current and longterm obligations when due ii adequate liquidity to fund capital expenditures and to maintain the planned dividend payout rate and iii flexibility to meet investment opportunities that may arise 

vf does not participate in transactions with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships established to facilitate offbalance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes 

risk management 

vf is exposed to risks in the ordinary course of business management regularly assesses and manages exposures to these risks through operating and financing activities and when appropriate by i taking advantage of natural hedges within vf ii purchasing insurance from commercial carriers or iii using derivative financial instruments some potential risks are discussed below 

insured risks 

vf is selfinsured for a significant portion of its employee medical workers’ compensation vehicle and general liability exposures vf purchases insurance from highlyrated commercial carriers to cover other risks including directors and officers property and umbrella and to establish stoploss limits on selfinsurance arrangements 

cash and equivalents risks 

vf had 123 billion  of cash and equivalents at the end of 2016 management continually monitors the credit ratings of the financial institutions with whom vf conducts business similarly management monitors the credit quality of cash equivalents 

defined benefit pension plan risks 

at the end of 2016 vf’s defined benefit pension plans were underfunded by a net total of 1350 million the underfunded status includes a 1380 million liability related to our unfunded us nonqualified defined benefit plan 371 million of net liabilities related to our nonus defined benefit plans and a 401 million asset related to our us qualified defined benefit plan vf has made significant cash contributions in recent years to improve the funded status of its plans including discretionary contributions to the us qualified plan of 2500 million in 2015 vf will continue to evaluate the funded status and future funding requirements of these plans which depends in part on the future performance of the plans’ investment portfolios management believes that vf has sufficient liquidity to make any required contributions to the pension plans in future years 

vf’s reported earnings are subject to risks due to the volatility of its pension expense which has ranged in recent years from 579 million in 2014 to 1130 million in 2016 including the 509 million settlement charge discussed below these fluctuations are primarily due to varying amounts of actuarial gains and losses that are deferred and amortized to future years’ expense the assumptions that impact actuarial gains and losses include the rate of return on investments held by the pension plans the discount rate used to value participant liabilities and demographic characteristics of the participants 

during 2016 vf took an additional step in managing pension risk by offering former employees in the us qualified plan a onetime option to receive a distribution of their deferred vested benefits pursuant to which the plan paid 1971 million in lumpsum distributions to settle 2247 million of projected benefit obligations the company recorded 509 million in settlement charges during 2016 to recognize the related deferred actuarial losses in accumulated other comprehensive income loss “oci” no additional funding of the pension plan was required as all distributions were paid out of existing plan assets and the plan’s funded status remained materially unchanged as a result of this offer however assuming other key assumptions remain unchanged pension expense will decrease in future years due to lower amortization of net deferred actuarial losses refer to note m to the consolidated financial statements and the “critical accounting policies and estimates” section below 

vf has taken a series of steps to manage the risk and volatility in the pension plans and their impact on the financial statements in 2005 vf’s us defined benefit plans were closed to new entrants which did not affect the benefits of existing plan participants at that date or their accrual of future benefits in more recent years the investment strategy of the us qualified plan has been revised to define dynamic asset allocation targets that are dependent upon changes in the plan’s funded status capital market expectations and risk tolerance additionally vf completed the onetime lumpsum offering noted above during 2016 which reduced the number of plan participants in the us qualified plan by 23  management will continue to evaluate actions that may help to reduce vf’s risks related to its defined benefit plans 

interest rate risks 

vf limits the risk of interest rate fluctuations by managing the mix of fixed and variable interest rate debt in addition vf may use derivative financial instruments to manage risk since all of vf’s longterm debt has fixed interest rates the exposure relates to changes in interest rates on variable rate shortterm borrowings which averaged 10 billion during 2016 however any change in interest rates would also affect interest income earned on vf’s cash equivalents based on the average amount of variable rate borrowings and cash equivalents during 2016 the effect of a hypothetical 1 increase in interest rates would be a decrease in reported net income of approximately 49 million 

foreign currency exchange rate risks 

vf is a global enterprise subject to the risk of foreign currency fluctuations approximately 38  of vf’s revenues in 2016 were generated in international markets most of vf’s foreign businesses operate in functional currencies other than the us dollar in periods where the us dollar strengthens relative to the euro or other foreign currencies where vf has operations there is a negative impact on vf’s operating results upon translation of those foreign operating results into the us dollar vf does not hedge the translation of foreign currency operating results into the us dollar however as discussed later in this section management does hedge vf’s investments in certain foreign operations and foreign currency transactions 

the reported values of assets and liabilities in these foreign businesses are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for net advances to and investments in vf’s foreign businesses that are considered to be longterm the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on those longterm advances is deferred as a component of accumulated oci in stockholders’ equity the us dollar value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries fluctuates with changes in the underlying functional currencies on september 20 2016 vf issued €850 million of eurodenominated fixedrate notes which it has designated as a net investment hedge of vf’s investment in certain foreign operations because this debt qualified as a nonderivative hedging instrument foreign currency transaction gains or losses of the debt are deferred in the foreign currency translation and other component of accumulated oci as an offset to the foreign currency translation adjustments on the hedged investments any amounts deferred in accumulated oci will remain until the hedged investment is sold or substantially liquidated 

vf monitors net foreign currency market exposures and enters into derivative foreign currency contracts to hedge the effects of exchange rate fluctuations for a significant portion of forecasted foreign currency cash flows or specific foreign currency transactions relating to crossborder inventory purchases production costs product sales operating costs and intercompany royalty payments vf’s practice is to buy or sell foreign currency exchange contracts that cover up to 80 of foreign currency exposures for periods of up to 24 months currently vf uses only forward foreign currency exchange contracts but may use options or collars in the future this use of financial instruments allows management to reduce the overall exposure to risks from exchange rate fluctuations on vf’s cash flows and earnings since gains and losses on these contracts will offset losses and gains on the transactions being hedged 

for cash flow hedging contracts outstanding at the end of 2016 if there were a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates compared to rates at the end of 2016 it would result in a change in fair value of those contracts of approximately 1684 million however any change in the fair value of the hedging contracts would be substantially offset by a change in the fair value of the underlying hedged exposure impacted by the currency rate changes 

counterparty risks 

vf is exposed to creditrelated losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to derivative hedging instruments to manage this risk we have established counterparty credit guidelines and only enter into derivative transactions with financial institutions that have ‘a minusa3’ investment grade credit ratings or better vf continually monitors the credit rating of and limits the amount hedged with each counterparty additionally management utilizes a portfolio of financial institutions to minimize exposure to potential counterparty defaults and adjusts positions as necessary vf also monitors counterparty risk for derivative contracts within the defined benefit pension plans 

commodity price risks 

vf is exposed to market risks for the pricing of cotton leather rubber wool and other materials which we either purchase directly or in a converted form such as fabric or shoe soles to manage risks of commodity price changes management negotiates prices in advance when possible vf has not historically managed commodity price exposures by using derivative instruments 

deferred compensation and related investment security risks 

vf has nonqualified deferred compensation plans in which liabilities to the plans’ participants are based on the market values of the participants’ selection of a hypothetical portfolio of investment funds including vf common stock vf invests in a portfolio of securities that substantially mirrors the participants’ investment selections the increases and decreases in deferred compensation liabilities except for the participants’ investment selections in vf common stock are substantially offset by corresponding increases and decreases in the market value of vf’s investments resulting in an insignificant net exposure to operating results and financial position the vf common stock is treated as treasury shares for financial reporting purposes so any gains or losses on those shares result in exposure to operating results and financial position as a result of the corresponding change in participant liabilities 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

vf has chosen accounting policies that management believes are appropriate to accurately and fairly report vf’s operating results and financial position in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us vf applies these accounting policies in a consistent manner significant accounting policies are summarized in note a to the consolidated financial statements 

the application of these accounting policies requires that vf make estimates and assumptions about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses contingent assets and liabilities and related disclosures these estimates assumptions and judgments are based on historical experience current trends and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis because vf’s business cycle is relatively short ie from the date that inventory is received until that inventory is sold and the trade receivable is collected actual results related to most estimates are known within a few months after any balance sheet date in addition vf may retain outside specialists to assist in valuations of business acquisitions impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets equity compensation pension benefits and selfinsured liabilities if actual results ultimately differ from previous estimates the revisions are included in results of operations when the actual amounts become known 

vf believes the following accounting policies involve the most significant management estimates assumptions and judgments used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements or are the most sensitive to change from outside factors the application of these critical accounting policies and estimates is discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors 

inventories 

vf’s inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value cost includes all material labor and overhead costs incurred to manufacture or purchase the finished goods overhead allocated to manufactured product is based on the normal capacity of plants and does not include amounts related to idle capacity or abnormal production inefficiencies vf performs a detailed review at each business unit at least quarterly of all inventories on the basis of individual styles or individual stylesizecolor stock keeping units to identify slow moving or excess products discontinued and tobediscontinued products and offquality merchandise this review matches inventory on hand plus current production and purchase commitments with current and expected future sales orders management performs an evaluation to estimate net realizable value using a systematic and consistent methodology of forecasting future demand market conditions and selling prices less costs of disposal if the estimated net realizable value is less than cost vf provides an allowance to reflect the lower value of that inventory this methodology recognizes inventory exposures at the time such losses are evident rather than at the time goods are actually sold historically these estimates of future demand and selling prices have not varied significantly from actual results due to vf’s timely identification and ability to rapidly dispose of these distressed inventories 

existence of physical inventory is verified through periodic physical inventory counts and ongoing cycle counts at most locations throughout the year vf provides for estimated inventory losses that have likely occurred since the last physical inventory date historically physical inventory shrinkage has not been significant 

longlived assets including intangible assets and goodwill 

vf allocates the purchase price of an acquired business to the fair values of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed with any excess purchase price recorded as goodwill vf evaluates fair value at acquisition using three valuation techniques  the replacement cost market and income methods  and weights the valuation methods based on what is most appropriate in the circumstances the process of assigning fair values particularly to acquired intangible assets is highly subjective 

fair value for acquired intangible assets is generally based on the present value of expected cash flows indefinitelived trademark or trade name intangible assets collectively referred to herein as “trademarks” represent individually acquired trademarks some of which are registered in multiple countries definitelived customer relationship intangible assets are based on the value of relationships with wholesale customers at the time of acquisition definitelived license intangible assets relate to numerous licensing contracts with vf as either the licensor or licensee goodwill represents the excess of cost of an acquired business over the fair value of net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired and is assigned at the reporting unit level 

vf’s depreciation policies for property plant and equipment reflect judgments on their estimated economic lives and residual value if any vf’s amortization policies for definitelived intangible assets reflect judgments on the estimated amounts and duration of future cash flows expected to be generated by those assets in evaluating the amortizable life for customer relationship intangible assets management considers historical attrition patterns for various groups of customers for licenserelated intangible assets management considers historical trends and anticipated license renewal periods 

vf’s policy is to review property plant and equipment and definitelived intangible assets for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable vf tests for 

potential impairment at the asset or asset group level which is the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent vf measures recoverability of the carrying value of an asset or asset group by comparison to the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if the forecasted undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset are not expected to be adequate to recover the asset’s carrying value a fair value analysis must be performed and an impairment charge is recorded if there is an excess of the asset’s carrying value over its estimated fair value 

when testing customer relationship intangible assets for potential impairment management considers historical customer attrition rates and projected revenues and profitability related to customers that existed at acquisition management uses the multiperiod excess earnings method which is a specific application of the discounted cash flow method to value customer relationship assets under this method vf calculates the present value of the aftertax cash flows expected to be generated by the customer relationship asset after deducting contributory asset charges 

vf’s policy is to evaluate indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill for possible impairment as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of such assets may be below their carrying amount as part of its annual impairment testing vf may elect to assess qualitative factors as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform quantitative impairment testing if management’s assessment of these qualitative factors indicates that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset or reporting unit is less than its carrying value then no further testing is required otherwise the intangible asset or reporting unit must be quantitatively tested for impairment 

an indefinitelived intangible asset is quantitatively tested for possible impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value fair value of an indefinitelived trademark is based on an income approach using the relieffromroyalty method under this method forecasted revenues for products sold with the trademark are assigned a royalty rate that would be charged to license the trademark in lieu of ownership and the estimated fair value is calculated as the present value of those forecasted royalties avoided by owning the trademark the appropriate discount rate is based on the reporting unit’s weighted average cost of capital “wacc” that considers market participant assumptions plus a spread that factors in the risk of the intangible asset the royalty rate is selected based on consideration of i royalty rates included in active license agreements if applicable ii royalty rates received by market participants in the apparel industry and iii the current performance of the reporting unit if the estimated fair value of the trademark intangible asset exceeds its carrying value there is no impairment charge if the estimated fair value of the trademark is less than its carrying value an impairment charge would be recognized for the difference 

goodwill is quantitatively evaluated for possible impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value reporting units are businesses with discrete financial information that is available and reviewed by coalition management in the first step of the quantitative goodwill impairment test vf compares the carrying value of a reporting unit including its recorded goodwill to the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 

for goodwill impairment testing vf estimates the fair value of a reporting unit using both incomebased and marketbased valuation methods the incomebased approach is based on the reporting unit’s forecasted future cash flows that are discounted to present value using the reporting unit’s wacc as discussed above for the marketbased approach management uses both the guideline company and similar transaction methods the guideline company method analyzes market multiples of revenues and earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” for a group of comparable public companies the market multiples used in the valuation are based on the relative strengths and weaknesses of the reporting unit compared to the selected guideline companies under the similar transactions method valuation multiples are calculated utilizing actual transaction prices and revenueebitda data from target companies deemed similar to the reporting unit 

based on the range of estimated fair values developed from the income and marketbased methods vf determines the estimated fair value for the reporting unit if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value the goodwill is not impaired and no further review is required however if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value vf performs the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the impairment charge if any the second step involves a hypothetical allocation of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill and liabilities as if the reporting unit were newly acquired which results in an implied fair value of the goodwill the amount of the impairment charge is the excess of the recorded goodwill if any over the implied fair value of the goodwill 

the incomebased fair value methodology requires management’s assumptions and judgments regarding economic conditions in the markets in which vf operates and conditions in the capital markets many of which are outside of management’s control at the reporting unit level fair value estimation requires management’s assumptions and judgments regarding the effects of overall economic conditions on the specific reporting unit along with assessment of the reporting unit’s strategies and forecasts of future cash flows forecasts of individual reporting unit cash flows involve management’s estimates and assumptions regarding 



 under the marketbased fair value methodology judgment is required in evaluating market multiples and recent transactions management believes that the assumptions used for its impairment tests are representative of those that would be used by market participants performing similar valuations of vf’s reporting units 

2016 impairment testing 

during the third quarter of 2016 management determined that there had been a triggering event related to the nautica ® reporting unit that required an interim impairment analysis of the goodwill and trademark intangible assets see additional discussion in the “ nautica ®  impairment analysis” section below  management concluded that there had been no triggering events affecting any other reporting units that required us to test goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets on an interim basis through the first nine months of 2016 

management performed its annual goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment testing as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2016 vf elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative analysis for the reef ® reporting unit goodwill and trademark intangible asset additionally during the fourth quarter of 2016 management determined that triggering events had occurred related to the lucy ®  and licensed sports group “lsg” reporting units requiring quantitative testing of their goodwill and trademark intangible assets management performed a qualitative analysis for all other reporting units and trademark intangible assets as discussed below in the “ other reporting units  qualitative impairment analysis ” section 

nautica ®  impairment analysis 

during the third quarter of 2016 management determined that the continued revenue and profitability decline in the nautica ® brand combined with a downward revision to the forecast for the remainder of the year was a triggering event that required an interim impairment analysis of the goodwill and trademark intangible assets based on the quantitative impairment analyses performed vf determined the goodwill and trademark were not impaired for goodwill the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by 45 the fair value of the trademark exceeded its carrying value by a significant amount 

the nautica ®  brand acquired in 2003 sells sportswear in the us through department stores specialty stores vfoperated stores and online it also has significant global licensing arrangements as part of the 2009 annual impairment analysesvf recorded an impairment charge of 585 million to write the goodwill down to its estimated fair value the remaining carrying values of the goodwill and trademark at the 2016 testing date were 1537 million and 2174 million respectively the nautica ® brand is part of the sportswear coalition and represents substantially all of the coalition’s goodwill value 

recent performance of the brand has been negatively impacted by an inconsistent retail environment in the us management’s revenue and profitability forecasts considered this recent negative performance and trends as well as strategic initiatives in future periods key assumptions developed by vf management and used in the quantitative analyses of the nautica ®  reporting unit and trademark include 

 

management made its estimates based on information available as of the date of our assessment using assumptions we believe market participants would use in performing an independent valuation of the business however if the us department store environment remains volatile in the near future we may be unable to execute on our planned initiatives to grow sales and profitability in the wholesale channel additionally our directtoconsumer channels may continue to be impacted by the inconsistent retail environment accordingly actual results could be negatively impacted and the goodwill may require additional impairment testing in future periods future impairment tests could result in a reduction of the 45 excess of fair value over reporting unit carrying value and possibly an impairment charge 

management performed sensitivity analyses on the impairment model and concluded that the goodwill was not impaired even with negative changes made to key assumptions for example the sensitivity analyses on the goodwill impairment model 

indicated that neither a 100 basis point decrease in the compounded annual growth rate “cagr” for ebitda nor a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate caused the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to decline below its carrying value 

as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2016 vf performed a qualitative impairment analysis of the goodwill and trademark for the nautica ®  reporting unit the qualitative impairment analyses primarily consisted of comparing actual performance to the forecasted performance used in the interim impairment analyses completed during the third quarter of 2016 based on the results of the qualitative analyses management concluded that it was not more likely than not that the carrying values of the goodwill and trademark were greater than their estimated fair values and that further quantitative testing was not necessary 

reef ®  impairment analysis 

as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2016 vf performed a quantitative impairment analysis of the goodwill and trademark intangible asset for the reef ®  reporting unit based on the analyses management concluded that the goodwill and trademark were not impaired for goodwill the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by 18 the estimated fair value of the trademark exceeded its carrying value by a significant amount 

the reef ®  brand acquired in 2005 sells surfinspired products including sandals shoes swimwear casual apparel and accessories products are sold through the wholesale channel and online primarily in north america as well as in european and south american markets as part of the 2009 annual impairment analyses vf recorded impairment charges of 311 million and 56 million related to the goodwill and trademark respectively the remaining carrying values of the goodwill and trademark at the 2016 testing date were 483 million and 744 million respectively the reef ® brand is part of the outdoor  action sports coalition 

recent performance by the brand has been negatively impacted by isolated events such as an unseasonably cold spring in 2014 supplier issues in 2015 and bankruptcies of wholesale customers and an inconsistent retail environment in the us in 2016 however vf is optimistic about the brand because of the nature of past challenges and the expected success of new product offerings key assumptions developed by vf management and used in the quantitative analyses of the reef ®  reporting unit and trademark include 

 management made its estimates based on information available as of the date of our assessment using assumptions we believe market participants would use in performing an independent valuation of the business however if the us retail environment continues to be inconsistent in the near future we may be unable to execute on our planned initiatives to grow sales and profitability accordingly actual results could be negatively impacted and the goodwill may require additional impairment testing in future periods future impairment tests could result in a reduction of the 18 excess of fair value over reporting unit carrying value and possibly an impairment charge 

management performed sensitivity analyses on the impairment model and concluded that the goodwill was not impaired even with negative changes made to key assumptions for goodwill a 15 decrease in projected cash flows did not cause the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to decline below its carrying value separately a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate did not cause the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to decline below its carrying value 

lucy ®  impairment analysis 

during the fourth quarter of 2016 management made a strategic decision to merge the lucy ® brand into the   north face ®  brand during 2017 this was a triggering event that required management to perform a quantitative impairment analysis of the goodwill and trademark intangible asset for the lucy ® reporting unit based on the analyses vf recorded impairment charges to writeoff the remaining goodwill balance of 393 million and the remaining trademark balance of 403 million 

the lucy ® reporting unit acquired in 2007 markets women’s activewear through vfoperated stores and in the wholesale channel through specialty and premium sporting goods retailers as part of the 2009 annual impairment analyses vf recorded impairment charges of 123 million and 97 million related to the goodwill and trademark respectively the lucy ® brand is part of the outdoor  action sports coalition 

key assumptions developed by vf management and used in our quantitative analyses of the lucy ® reporting unit and trademark include 

 

management utilized quantitative information along with significant observable inputs to determine that no value was remaining for the goodwill or trademark 

lsg impairment analysis 

during the fourth quarter of 2016 major league baseball “mlb” informed vf that it would not be renewing its contract with the majestic ®  brand when it expires at the end of 2019 this was a triggering event that required management to perform a quantitative impairment analysis of the goodwill and trademark intangible asset for the lsg reporting unit based on the analyses management concluded that the goodwill and trademark were not impaired for goodwill the estimated fair value exceeded the reporting unit’s carrying value by approximately 38 the estimated fair value of the trademark exceeded its carrying value by a significant amount the carrying values of the goodwill and trademark at the 2016 testing date were 286 million and 60 million respectively 

the majestic ®  business acquired in 2007 designs and markets sports apparel and fanwear under licenses granted by major sports leagues and related organizations including major league baseball the national football league the major league baseball players association the national basketball association the national football league players association the national hockey league and the nippon professional baseball league majestic ® is a brand in the lsg reporting unit which is part of the imagewear coalition the lsg reporting unit is also a major supplier of licensed harleydavidson ®  apparel to harleydavidson dealerships 

the lsg reporting unit has experienced strong revenue and profit growth in recent years primarily due to product innovation and heightened brand awareness that has led to solid performance in the wholesale business key assumptions developed by vf management and used in the quantitative analyses of the lsg reporting unit and trademark include 

 actual results for the lsg reporting unit may vary from projected results accordingly management performed sensitivity analyses on the impairment model and concluded that the goodwill was not impaired even with negative changes made to key assumptions for goodwill a 40 decrease in projected cash flows did not cause the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to decline below its carrying value separately a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate did not cause the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to decline below its carrying value 

also during the fourth quarter of 2016 management concluded that a triggering event had occurred related to the majestic ® definitelived customer relationship and license intangible assets that required management to perform quantitative impairment analyses management concluded that the remaining undiscounted cash flows for the customer relationship and license assets were greater than their net book values and thus the assets were not impaired the carrying values of the customer relationship and license intangible assets at the 2016 testing date were 82 million and 220 million respectively 

the customer relationship asset was established for 214 million at the time of the majestic ® acquisition and was being amortized over an 18year life using accelerated amortization the valuation of the customer relationship asset considered historical and projected attrition rates revenues and profitability related to wholesale customers that existed at acquisition the customer relationship intangible asset will continue to be amortized over the remaining useful life 

the license asset was established for 471 million at the time of the majestic ® acquisition and was being amortized over an 18year life using straightline amortization the license asset valuation considered current and projected revenues and profitability related to the mlb business based on the expiration date of the mlb contract the remaining useful life for the license intangible asset was revised to 39 months and amortization was accelerated beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016 

other reporting units  qualitative impairment analysis 

for all other reporting units vf elected to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the goodwill and trademark intangible assets in those reporting units were impaired in this qualitative assessment vf 

considered relevant events and circumstances for each reporting unit including i current year results ii financial performance versus management’s annual and fiveyear strategic plans iii changes in the reporting unit carrying value since prior year iv industry and market conditions in which the reporting unit operates v macroeconomic conditions including discount rate changes and vi changes in products or services offered by the reporting unit if applicable performance in recent years was compared to forecasts included in prior valuations based on the results of the qualitative assessment vf concluded that it was not more likely than not that the carrying values of the goodwill and trademark intangible assets were greater than their fair values and that further quantitative testing was not necessary 

management’s use of estimates and assumptions 

management made its estimates based on information available as of the date of our assessment using assumptions we believe market participants would use in performing an independent valuation of the business it is possible that vf’s conclusions regarding impairment or recoverability of goodwill or intangible assets in any reporting unit could change in future periods there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions used in our goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing will prove to be accurate predictions of the future if for example i the businesses do not perform as projected ii overall economic conditions in 2017 or future years vary from current assumptions including changes in discount rates iii business conditions or strategies for a specific reporting unit change from current assumptions including loss of major customers iv investors require higher rates of return on equity investments in the marketplace or v enterprise values of comparable publicly traded companies or actual sales transactions of comparable companies were to decline resulting in lower multiples of revenues and ebitda 

a future impairment charge for goodwill or intangible assets could have a material effect on vf’s consolidated financial position and results of operations 

stock options 

vf uses a lattice optionpricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees and nonemployee members of the board of directors vf believes that a lattice model provides a refined estimate of the fair value of options because it can incorporate i historical option exercise patterns and multiple assumptions about future option exercise patterns for each of several groups of option holders and ii inputs that vary over time such as assumptions for interest rates and volatility management performs an annual review of all assumptions employed in the valuation of option grants and believes they are reflective of the outstanding options and underlying common stock and of groups of option participants the lattice valuation incorporates the assumptions listed in note o to the consolidated financial statements 

one of the critical assumptions in the valuation process is estimating the expected average life of the options before they are exercised for each option grant vf estimated the expected average life based on evaluations of the historical and expected option exercise patterns for each of the groups of option holders that have historically exhibited different option exercise patterns these evaluations included i voluntary stock option exercise patterns based on a combination of changes in the price of vf common stock and periods of time that options are outstanding before exercise and ii involuntary exercise patterns resulting from turnover retirement and death 

volatility is another critical assumption requiring judgment management bases its estimates of future volatility on a combination of implied and historical volatility implied volatility is based on shortterm 6 to 9 months publicly traded nearthemoney options on vf common stock vf measures historical volatility over a tenyear period corresponding to the contractual term of the options using daily stock prices management’s assumption for valuation purposes is that expected volatility starts at a level equal to the implied volatility and then transitions to the historical volatility over the remainder of the tenyear option term 

pension obligations 

vf sponsors a qualified defined benefit pension plan covering most fulltime us employees hired before 2005 and an unfunded supplemental defined benefit pension plan that provides benefits in excess of the limitations imposed by income tax regulations vf also sponsors certain nonus defined benefit pension plans the selection of actuarial assumptions for determining the projected pension benefit liabilities and annual pension expense is significant due to amounts involved and the long time period over which benefits are accrued and paid 

annually management reviews the principal economic actuarial assumptions summarized in note m to the consolidated financial statements and revises them as appropriate based on current rates and trends as of december 31 st  vf also periodically reviews and revises as necessary other plan assumptions such as rates of compensation increases retirement termination disability and mortality vf believes the assumptions appropriately reflect the participants’ demographics and projected benefit obligations of the plans and result in the best estimate of the plans’ future experience actual results may vary from the actuarial assumptions used 

the below discussion of discount rate return on assets and mortality assumptions relates specifically to the us pension plans as they comprise approximately 92 of vf’s total defined benefit plan assets and approximately 90 of vf’s total projected benefit obligations of the combined us and international plans 

one of the critical assumptions used in the actuarial model is the discount rate which is used to estimate the present value of future cash outflows necessary to meet projected benefit obligations for the specific plan it is the estimated interest rate that vf could use to settle its projected benefit obligations at the valuation date the discount rate assumption is based on current market interest rates vf selects a discount rate for each of the us pension plans by matching high quality corporate bond yields to the timing of projected benefit payments to participants in each plan vf uses the population of us corporate bonds rated ‘aa’ by moody’s investors service or standard  poor’s ratings services vf excludes the highest and lowest yielding bonds from this population of approximately 696 such bonds having at least 500 million outstanding that are noncallablenonputable unless with makewhole provisions each plan’s projected benefit payments are matched to current market interest rates over the expected payment period to calculate an associated present value a single equivalent discount rate is then determined that produces the same present value the resulting discount rate is reflective of both the current interest rate environment and the plan’s distinct liability characteristics vf believes that those ‘aa’ rated issues meet the “high quality” intent of the applicable accounting standards and that the 2016 discount rates of 410 for the us qualified defined benefit pension plan and 414 for the unfunded supplemental defined benefit plan appropriately reflect current market conditions and the longterm nature of projected benefit payments to participants in the us pension plans these lower discount rates compared with the rates of 445 for the us qualified defined benefit pension plan and 444 for the unfunded supplemental defined benefit plan at the end of 2015 reflect the general decrease in yields of us government obligations and high quality corporate bonds during 2016 the discount rate for the plans may differ from the rates used by other companies because of a longer expected duration of benefit payments reflecting i the higher percentage of female participants who generally have a longer life expectancy than males and ii the higher percentage of inactive participants who will not begin receiving vested benefits for many years 

in 2015 vf adopted the spot rate approach to measure service and interest costs under the spot rate approach the full yield curve is applied separately to cash flows for each projected benefit obligation service cost and interest cost for a more precise calculation vf expects that the spot rate approach will continue to lower service and interest cost in the next several years 

another critical assumption of the actuarial model is the expected longterm rate of return on investments vf’s investment objective is to invest in a diversified portfolio of assets with an acceptable level of risk to maximize the longterm return while minimizing volatility in the value of plan assets relative to the value of plan liabilities these risks include market interest rate credit liquidity regulatory and foreign securities risks investment assets consist of us and international equity corporate and governmental fixedincome securities insurance contracts and alternative assets vf develops a projected rate of return for each of the investment asset classes based on many factors including historical and expected returns the estimated inflation rate the premium to be earned in excess of a riskfree return the premium for equity risk and the premium for longer duration fixedincome securities the weighted average projected longterm rates of return of the various assets held by the qualified plan provide the basis for the expected longterm rate of return actuarial assumption vf’s rate of return assumption was 600 in 2016 625 in 2015 and 650 in 2014 in recent years vf has altered the investment mix by i increasing the allocation to fixedincome investments and reducing the allocation to equity investments ii increasing the allocation in equities to more international investments and iii adding alternative assets as an asset class the changes in asset allocation are anticipated over time to reduce the yeartoyear variability of the us plan’s funded status and resulting pension expense management monitors the plan’s asset allocation to balance risk with anticipated investment returns in a given year based on an evaluation of market conditions and projected market returns vf will be using a rate of return assumption of 600 for the us plan for 2017 

we consistently review all of our demographic assumptions as part of the normal management of our defined benefit plans and update these assumptions as appropriate in 2014 the society of actuaries soa issued new mortality tables rp2014 and mortality improvement scales mp2014 which reflect longer life expectancies than the previous tables this updated information was considered along with the characteristics of our planspecific populations and other data where appropriate in developing our best estimate of the expected mortality rates of plan participants in the us pension plans in 2015 and 2016 the soa issued mp2015 and mp2016 respectively which are updated scales based on the same underlying soa rp2014 study that reflect two additional years of mortality experience vf considered the mp2015 and mp2016 scales and determined they are directionally consistent with the assumptions adopted by vf in 2014 

differences between actual results in a given year and the actuarially determined assumed results for that year eg investment performance discount rates and other assumptions do not affect that year’s pension expense but instead are deferred as unrecognized actuarial gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheet at the end of 2016 there were 4761 million of pretax accumulated deferred actuarial losses plus 149 million of pretax deferred prior service costs resulting in an after tax amount of 3027 million in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the 2016 consolidated balance sheet these deferred losses will be amortized as a component of pension expense 

pension expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements was 1130 million in 2016 648 million in 2015 and 579 million in 2014 this compares with the cost of pension benefits actually earned each year by covered active employees commonly called “service cost” of 258 million in 2016 292 million in 2015 and 242 million in 2014 pension expense has been significantly higher than the annual service cost in recent years due to the settlement charge incurred in 2016 as discussed in the paragraph below and amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses as discussed in the preceding paragraph looking forward vf expects 2017 pension expense to decrease to approximately 393 million which reflects a reduction in expense related to the lump sum distributions paid from the us qualified plan partially offset by a decrease in discount rates 

in 2016 the company offered former employees in the us qualified plan a onetime option to receive a distribution of their deferred vested benefits approximately 9400  participants accepted a distribution representing 66  of eligible participants and a 23  reduction in the total number of plan participants at the beginning of the year in december 2016 the plan paid 1971 million in lumpsum distributions to settle 2247 million of projected benefit obligations related to these participants vf recorded  509 million  in settlement charges during 2016 to recognize the related deferred actuarial losses in accumulated oci the settlement charge was included in 2016 pension expense 

the sensitivity of changes in actuarial assumptions on 2016 pension expense and on projected benefit obligations related to the us defined benefit pension plan at the end of 2016 all other factors being equal is illustrated by the following 

  



as discussed in the “risk management” section above vf has taken a series of steps to reduce volatility in the pension plans and their impact on the financial statements on a longerterm basis vf believes the yeartoyear variability of the retirement benefit expense should decrease 

income taxes 

as a global company vf is subject to income taxes and files income tax returns in over 100 us and foreign jurisdictions each year almost every jurisdiction in which vf operates has a lower effective income tax rate than the us as discussed in note p to the consolidated financial statements vf has been granted a lower effective income tax rate on taxable earnings in certain foreign jurisdictions due to economic and political conditions tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change the company could be subject to changes in its tax rates the adoption of new us or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities vf makes an ongoing assessment to identify any significant exposure related to increases in tax rates in the jurisdictions in which vf operates 

in february 2015 the european union commission “eu” opened a state aid investigation into rulings granted to companies under belgium’s excess profit tax regime on january 11 2016 the eu announced its decision that these rulings were illegal and ordered that tax benefits granted under these rulings should be collected from the affected companies including vf the belgian government and vf have each filed appeals seeking annulment of the eu decision on january 10 2017 vf europe bvba received an assessment for €319 million tax and interest related to excess profits benefits received in prior years and remitted €319 million 339 million on january 13 2017 this will be recorded as an income tax receivable in 2017 based on the expected success of the aforementioned requests for annulment if this matter is adversely resolved these amounts will not be collected by vf 

the calculation of income tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations which are subject to legal interpretation and significant management judgment vf’s income tax returns are regularly examined by federal state and foreign tax authorities and those audits may result in proposed adjustments vf has reviewed all issues raised upon examination as well as any exposure for issues that may be raised in future examinations vf has evaluated these potential issues under the “morelikelythannot” standard of the accounting literature a tax position is recognized if it meets this standard and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized such judgments and estimates may change based on audit settlements court cases and interpretation of tax laws and regulations income tax expense could be 

materially affected to the extent vf prevails in a tax position or when the statute of limitations expires for a tax position for which a liability for unrecognized tax benefits or valuation allowances have been established or to the extent vf is required to pay amounts greater than the established liability for unrecognized tax benefits vf does not currently anticipate any material impact on earnings from the ultimate resolution of income tax uncertainties there are no accruals for general or unknown tax expenses 

vf has 1526 million of gross deferred income tax assets related to operating loss and capital loss carryforwards and 1082 million of valuation allowances against those assets realization of deferred tax assets related to operating loss and capital loss carryforwards is dependent on future taxable income in specific jurisdictions the amount and timing of which are uncertain and on possible changes in tax laws if management believes that vf will not be able to generate sufficient taxable income or capital gains to offset losses during the carryforward periods vf records valuation allowances to reduce those deferred tax assets to amounts expected to be ultimately realized if in a future period management determines that the amount of deferred tax assets to be realized differs from the net recorded amount vf would record an adjustment to income tax expense in that future period 

vf has not provided us income taxes on a portion of the foreign subsidiaries’ undistributed earnings because these earnings are permanently reinvested in the respective foreign jurisdictions vf has not determined the deferred tax liabilities associated with these undistributed earnings as such determination is not practicable if vf decided to remit those earnings to the us in a future period the provision for income taxes could increase in that period

approximately 70 of image revenues are from industrial laundries resellers and distributors that in turn supply customized workwear to employers for production service and whitecollar personnel since industrial laundries and distributors maintain minimal inventories of work clothes vf’s ability to offer rapid delivery of products in a broad range of sizes is an important advantage in this market our commitment to customer service supported by an automated central distribution center with several satellite locations enables customer orders to be filled within 24 hours of receipt as a result the red kap ® and bulwark ® brands have a strong presence in the reseller distributor market and are growing in the workwear retail market

directtoconsumer operations 

our directtoconsumer business includes fullprice stores outlet stores ecommerce and concession retail locations directtoconsumer revenues were 27 of total vf revenues in 2015 compared with 26 in 2014 

our fullprice stores allow us to display a brand’s full line of products with fixtures and imagery that support the brand’s positioning and promise to consumers these experiences provide high visibility for our brands and products and enable us to stay close to the needs and preferences of our consumers the complete and impactful presentation of products in our stores also helps to increase sellthrough of vf products at our wholesale customers due to increased brand awareness education and visibility vfoperated fullprice stores generally provide gross margins that are well above vf averages 

in addition vf operates outlet stores in both premium outlet malls and more traditional valuebased locations these outlet stores serve an important role in our overall inventory management and profitability by allowing vf to sell a significant portion of excess discontinued and outofseason products at better prices than otherwise available from outside parties while maintaining the integrity of our brands 

our growing global directtoconsumer operations include 1520 stores at the end of 2015 we operate retail store locations for the following brands vans ®  timberland ®  the north face ®  kipling ®  nautica ®  7 for all mankind ®    lee ®  wrangler ®  lucy ®  napapijri ®  splendid ® and ella moss ®  we also operate over 75 vf outlet ® stores in the us that sell a broad selection of excess vf products as well as other nonvf products approximately 70 of vfoperated stores offer products at full price and the remainder are outlet locations 

  

approximately 60 of our stores are located in the americas region 55 in the us 25 in europe and 15 in the asia pacific region additionally we have over 1100 concession retail stores located principally in europe and asia 

ecommerce is our fastest growing directtoconsumer channel and represented approximately 16 of our directtoconsumer business in 2015 we currently market the following brands online the north face ®  vans ®  timberland ®  lee ®  kipling ®  wrangler ®  7 for all mankind ®  lucy ®  nautica ®  smartwool ®  napapijri ®  jansport ®  splendid ®  ella moss ®  eagle creek ®  eastpak ® and reef ®  we continue to expand our ecommerce initiatives by rolling out additional countryspecific brand sites in europe and asia which enhances our ability to deliver a superior localized consumer experience 

we expect our directtoconsumer business to continue to grow at a faster pace than vf’s overall growth rate as we continue to drive higher comparable store sales open new stores and expand our ecommerce presence we opened 186 stores during 2015 concentrating on the brands where we see higher retail growth potential — vans ®  the north face ®  timberland ® and kipling ®  

in addition to our directtoconsumer operations our licensees distributors and other independent parties own and operate over 3000 partnership stores these are primarily monobrand retail locations selling vf products that have the appearance of vfoperated stores most of these partnership stores are located in europe and asia and are concentrated in the timberland ®  lee ®  the north face ®  vans ®  wrangler ®  nautica ®  kipling ® and napapijri ® brands 

licensing arrangements 

as part of our strategy of expanding market penetration of vfowned brands we enter into licensing agreements with independent parties for specific apparel and complementary product categories when such arrangements provide more effective manufacturing distribution and marketing than could be achieved internally we provide support to these business partners and ensure the integrity of our brand names by taking an active role in the design quality control advertising marketing and distribution of licensed products 

licensing arrangements relate to a broad range of vf brands license agreements are for fixed terms of generally 3 to 5 years with conditional renewal options each licensee pays royalties to vf based on its sales of licensed products with most agreements providing for a minimum royalty requirement royalties generally range from 4 to 10 of the licensing partners’ net licensed products sales royalty income was 1261 million in 2015 1 of total revenues primarily from the nautica ®  vans ®  lee ®  timberland ®  and wrangler ® brands in addition licensees of our brands are generally required to spend from 1 to 3 of their net licensed product sales to advertise vf’s products in some cases these advertising amounts are remitted to vf for advertising on behalf of the licensees 

vf has also entered into license agreements to use trademarks owned by third parties we market apparel under licenses granted by major league baseball the major league baseball players association the national football league the national football league players association the national basketball association the national hockey league harleydavidson motor company inc major colleges and universities and individual athletes and related organizations most of which contain minimum annual royalty and advertising requirements 

manufacturing sourcing and distribution 

product design and innovation including fit fabric finish and quality are important elements across our businesses these functions are performed by employees located in our global supply chain organization and our branded business units across the globe 

vf recently launched three strategic global innovation centers that focus on product innovation in technical apparel footwear and jeanswear the centers are staffed with dedicated scientists engineers and technical designers who combine proprietary insights with consumer needs and a deep understanding of technology and new materials the innovation centers are expected to drive brand equity and sustained longterm growth 

  

vf’s centralized global supply chain organization is responsible for producing procuring and delivering products to our customers vf is highly skilled in managing the complexities associated with our global supply chain on an annual basis vf sources or produces approximately 557 million units spread across more than 30 brands our products are obtained from 28 vfoperated manufacturing facilities and approximately 1900 contractor manufacturing facilities in over 60 countries additionally we operate 32 distribution centers and 1520 retail stores managing this complexity is made possible by the use of a network of information systems for product development forecasting order management and warehouse management along with our core enterprise resource management platforms 

in 2015 23 of our units were manufactured in vfowned facilities and 77 were obtained from independent contractors products manufactured in vf facilities generally have a lower cost and shorter lead times than products procured from independent contractors products obtained from contractors in the western hemisphere generally have a higher cost than products obtained from contractors in asia however contracting in the western hemisphere gives us greater flexibility shorter lead times and allows for lower inventory levels this combination of vfowned and contracted production along with different geographic regions and cost structures provides a wellbalanced flexible approach to product sourcing we will continue to manage our supply chain from a global perspective and adjust as needed to changes in the global production environment 

vf operates manufacturing facilities in the us mexico central and south america the caribbean and europe a significant percentage of denim bottoms and occupational apparel is manufactured in these plants as well as a smaller percentage of footwear for these owned production facilities we purchase raw materials from numerous us and international suppliers to meet our production needs raw materials include products made from cotton leather rubber wool synthetics and blends of cotton and synthetic yarn as well as thread and trim product identification buttons zippers snaps eyelets and laces in some instances we contract the sewing of vfowned raw materials into finished product with independent contractors manufacturing in the us includes all major league baseball uniforms along with screen printing and embroidery of jerseys tshirts and fleece products fixed price commitments for fabric and certain supplies are generally set on a quarterly basis for the next quarter’s purchases no single supplier represents more than 10 of our total cost of goods sold 

independent contractors generally own the raw materials and ship finished readyforsale products to vf these contractors are engaged through vf sourcing hubs in hong kong with satellite offices across asia and panama these hubs are responsible for coordinating the manufacturing and procurement of product supplier management product quality assurance and transportation and shipping functions in the eastern and western hemispheres respectively substantially all products in the outdoor  action sports and sportswear coalitions as well as a portion of products for our jeanswear and imagewear coalitions are obtained through these sourcing hubs for most products in our contemporary brands coalition we contract the sewing and finishing of vfowned raw materials through a network of independent contractors based primarily in the us 

management continually monitors political risks and developments related to duties tariffs and quotas we limit vf’s sourcing exposure through among other measures i diversifying geographies with a mix of vfoperated and contracted production ii shifting of production among countries and contractors iii sourcing production to merchandise categories where product is readily available and iv sourcing from countries with tariff preference and free trade agreements vf does not directly or indirectly source products from suppliers in countries that are prohibited by the us state department 

all vfoperated production facilities throughout the world as well as all independent contractor facilities that manufacture vf products must comply with vf’s global compliance principles these principles established in 1997 and consistent with international labor standards are a set of strict standards covering legal and ethical business practices workers’ ages work hours health and safety conditions environmental standards 

  

and compliance with local laws and regulations in addition our owned factories must also undergo certification by the independent nonprofit organization worldwide responsible accredited production “wrap” which promotes global ethics in manufacturing 

vf through its contractor monitoring program audits the activities of the independent businesses and contractors that produce vf products at locations across the globe each of the approximately 1900 independent contractor facilities including those serving our independent licensees must be precertified before producing vf products this precertification includes passing a factory inspection and signing a vf terms of engagement agreement we maintain an ongoing audit program to ensure compliance with these requirements by using dedicated internal staff and externally contracted firms additional information about vf’s code of business conduct global compliance principles terms of engagement factory compliance guidelines factory audit procedure and environmental compliance guidelines along with a global compliance report is available on the vf website at wwwvfccom 

vf did not experience difficulty in fulfilling its raw material and contracting production needs during 2015 absent any material changes vf believes it would be able to largely offset any increases in product costs through i the continuing shift in the mix of its business to higher margin brands geographies and channels of distribution ii increases in the prices of its products and iii cost reduction opportunities the loss of any one supplier or contractor would not have a significant adverse effect on our business 

product is shipped from our independent suppliers and vfoperated manufacturing facilities to distribution centers around the world in some instances product is shipped directly to our customers most distribution centers are operated by vf and some support more than one brand a portion of our distribution needs are met by contract distribution centers 

seasonality 

vf’s quarterly operating results vary due to the seasonality of our individual businesses and are historically stronger in the second half of the year on a quarterly basis in 2015 consolidated revenues ranged from a low of 20 of full year revenues in the second quarter to a high of 29 in the third quarter while consolidated operating margin ranged from a low of 9 in the second quarter to a high of 18 in the third quarter this variation results primarily from the seasonal influences on revenues of our outdoor  action sports coalition where 19 of the coalition’s revenues occurred in the second quarter compared to 31 in the third quarter of 2015 with changes in our mix of business and the growth of our retail operations historical quarterly revenue and profit trends may not be indicative of future trends 

working capital requirements vary throughout the year working capital increases early in the year as inventory builds to support peak shipping periods and then moderates later in the year as those inventories are sold and accounts receivable are collected cash provided by operating activities is substantially higher in the second half of the year due to higher net income during that period and reduced working capital requirements particularly during the fourth quarter 

advertising customer support and community outreach 

during 2015 our advertising and promotion expense was 7126 million representing 58 of total revenues we advertise in consumer and trade publications on radio and television and through digital initiatives including social media and mobile platforms on the internet we also participate in cooperative advertising on a shared cost basis with major retailers in print media radio and television we sponsor sporting musical and special events as well as athletes and personalities who promote our products we employ marketing sciences to optimize the impact of advertising and promotional spending and to identify the types of spending that provide the greatest return on our marketing investments 

we provide advertising support to our wholesale customers in the form of pointofsale fixtures and signage to enhance the presentation and brand image of our products we also participate in shopinshops and 

  

concession retail arrangements which are separate sales areas dedicated to a specific vf brand within our customers’ stores to help differentiate and enhance the presentation of our products 

we contribute to incentive programs with our wholesale customers including cooperative advertising funds discounts and allowances we also offer sales incentive programs directly to consumers in the form of rebate and coupon offers 

in addition to sponsorships and activities that directly benefit our products and brands vf and its associates actively support our communities and various charities for example the north face ® brand has committed to programs that encourage and enable outdoor participation such as the north face endurance challenge ® and the north face explore fund ™ programs the timberland ® brand has a strong heritage of volunteerism including the path of service ™ program that offers fulltime employees up to 40 hours of paid time off a year to serve their local communities through global service events such as earth day in the spring and servapalooza in the fall the wrangler ® brand launched the tough enough to wear pink ™ program which honors and raises money for breast cancer survivors and the national patriot program ™  which funds agencies that serve wounded and fallen american military veterans and their families the vans ® brand has hosted annual vans ® earth day and vans ® gives back day events in which all employees at brand headquarters spend the day volunteering in the community the nautica ® brand supports oceana a notforprofit organization focused on ocean conservatism and charity water a notforprofit organization focused on providing clean safe water to people in need in addition 2015 marked the twentieth year of support for the lee national denim day ® event one of the country’s largest singleday fundraisers for breast cancer that has raised over 93 million since its inception to fight breast cancer vf sponsors the “vf 100” program to honor the 100 vf associates worldwide having the highest number of volunteer service hours during the year 

sustainability 

vf’s approach to sustainability and responsibility “sr” is to responsibly manage its business from the way it makes distributes and markets products to the ways it preserves the environment and supports local communities in 2014 vf launched its inaugural sr report a compilation of the many actions and investments taking place across vf for our businesses to operate in a sustainable manner during 2015 vf continued to expand its global sustainability infrastructure and governance practices by requiring our top brands to report on their sr practices and strategies on at least an annual basis in addition we are on track to meet our first carbon reduction goal to reduce our carbon footprint by 5 with a 2009 baseline year vf also recognized seven usbased distribution centers as being “zerowaste” meaning at least 95 percent of the waste from these factories will be diverted from landfills through recycling composting and reuse other current initiatives include i an ongoing partnership with the better cotton initiative to promote sustainable farming methods ii retrofitting owned facilities with led lighting and pursuing leed leadership in energy and environmental design or breeam building research establishment environmental assessment methodology certification for new offices and distribution centers and iii continuing our innovative approach to responsible chemical management in our supply chain via the chemiq sm chemical management program an industryleading method that allows us to identify and eliminate harmful chemicals before they enter our manufacturing process in addition vf announced its goal to be 100 powered by renewable energy by 2025 at all owned and operated facilities 

other matters 

competitive factors

intellectual property 

trademarks trade names patents and domain names as well as related logos designs and graphics provide substantial value in the development and marketing of vf’s products and are important to our continued success we have registered this intellectual property in the us and in other countries where our products are manufactured andor sold we vigorously monitor and enforce vf’s intellectual property against counterfeiting infringement and violations of other rights where and to the extent legal feasible and appropriate in addition we grant licenses to other parties to manufacture and sell products utilizing our intellectual property in product categories and geographic areas in which vf does not operate

 item 1a risk factors  

the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating vf’s business and the forwardlooking statements contained in this form 10k any of the following risks could materially adversely affect vf’s business its operating results and its financial condition 

  

vf’s revenues and profits depend on the level of consumer spending for apparel and footwear which is sensitive to global economic conditions and other factors a decline in consumer spending could have a material adverse effect on vf 

the success of vf’s business depends on consumer spending and there are a number of factors that influence consumer spending including actual and perceived economic conditions disposable consumer income interest rates consumer credit availability unemployment stock market performance weather conditions energy prices and tax rates in the international national regional and local markets where vf’s products are sold the current global economic environment is unpredictable and adverse economic trends or other factors could negatively impact the level of consumer spending and have a material adverse impact on vf 

the apparel and footwear industries are highly competitive and vf’s success depends on its ability to gauge consumer preferences and product trends and respond to constantly changing markets 

vf competes with numerous apparel and footwear brands and manufacturers competition is generally based upon brand name recognition price design product quality selection service and purchasing convenience some of our competitors are larger and have more resources than vf in some product categories and regions in addition vf competes directly with the private label brands of its wholesale customers vf’s ability to compete within the apparel and footwear industries depends on our ability to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 failure to compete effectively or to keep pace with rapidly changing consumer preferences markets and product trends could have a material adverse effect on vf’s business financial condition and results of operations 

vf’s results of operations could be materially harmed if we are unable to accurately forecast demand for our products 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully anticipate changing consumer preferences and product trends or economic conditions and as a result we may not successfully manage inventory levels to meet our future order requirements we often schedule internal production and place orders for products with independent manufacturers before our customers’ orders are firm if we fail to accurately forecast consumer demand we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of product required to meet the demand inventory levels in excess of consumer demand may result in inventory writedowns the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices or excess inventory held by our wholesale customers which could have a negative impact on future sales an adverse effect on the image and reputation of vf’s brands and negatively impact profitability on the other hand if we underestimate demand for our products our manufacturing facilities or thirdparty manufacturers may not be able to produce products to meet consumer requirements and this could result in delays in the shipment of products and lost revenues as well as damage to vf’s reputation and relationships these risks could have a material adverse effect on our brand image as well as our results of operations and financial condition 

  

vf’s business and the success of its products could be harmed if vf is unable to maintain the images of its brands 

vf’s success to date has been due in large part to the growth of its brands’ images and vf’s customers’ connection to its brands if we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to changing consumer demand the names and images of our brands may be impaired even if we react appropriately to changes in consumer preferences consumers may consider our brands’ images to be outdated or associate our brands with styles that are no longer popular in addition brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of qualities including merchandise quality and corporate integrity negative claims or publicity regarding vf its brands or its products including licensed products could adversely affect our reputation and sales regardless of whether such claims are accurate social media which accelerates the dissemination of information can increase the challenges of responding to negative claims in the past many apparel companies have experienced periods of rapid growth in sales and earnings followed by periods of declining sales and losses our businesses may be similarly affected in the future in addition we have sponsorship contracts with a number of athletes and musicians and feature those individuals in our advertising and marketing efforts actions taken by those individuals associated with our products could harm their reputations and adversely affect the images of our brands 

vf’s revenues and cash requirements are affected by the seasonal nature of its business 

vf’s business is increasingly seasonal with a higher proportion of revenues and operating cash flows generated during the second half of the fiscal year which includes the fall and holiday selling seasons poor sales in the second half of the fiscal year would have a material adverse effect on vf’s full year operating results and cause higher inventories in addition fluctuations in sales and operating income in any fiscal quarter are affected by the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales 

vf’s profitability may decline as a result of increasing pressure on margins 

the apparel industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors including intense competition consolidation in the retail industry pressure from retailers to reduce the costs of products and changes in consumer demand if these factors cause us to reduce our sales prices to retailers and consumers and we fail to sufficiently reduce our product costs or operating expenses vf’s profitability will decline this could have a material adverse effect on vf’s results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

vf may not succeed in its business strategy 

one of vf’s key strategic objectives is growth we seek to grow organically and through acquisitions we seek to grow by building new lifestyle brands expanding our share with winning customers stretching vf’s brands to new regions managing costs leveraging our supply chain and information technology capabilities across vf and expanding our directtoconsumer business including opening new stores and remodeling and expanding our existing stores and growing our ecommerce business we may not be able to grow our existing businesses we may have difficulty completing acquisitions and we may not be able to successfully integrate a newly acquired business or achieve the expected growth cost savings or synergies from such integration we may not be able to expand our market share with winning customers expand our brands geographically or achieve the expected results from our supply chain initiatives we may have difficulty recruiting developing or retaining qualified employees we may not be able to achieve our store and ecommerce expansion goals manage our growth effectively successfully integrate the planned new stores into our operations or operate our new remodeled and expanded stores profitably failure to implement our strategic objectives may have a material adverse effect on vf’s business 

vf relies significantly on information technology any inadequacy interruption integration failure or security failure of this technology could harm vf’s ability to effectively operate its business 

our ability to effectively manage and operate our business depends significantly on information technology systems we rely heavily on information technology to track sales and inventory and manage our supply chain 

  

we are also dependent on information technology including the internet for our directtoconsumer sales including our ecommerce operations and retail business credit card transaction authorization despite our preventative efforts our systems and those of our thirdparty service providers may be vulnerable to damage or interruption the failure of these systems to operate effectively problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems difficulty in integrating new systems or systems of acquired businesses or a breach in security of these systems could adversely impact the operations of vf’s business including management of inventory ordering and replenishment of products ecommerce operations retail business credit card transaction authorization and processing corporate email communications and our interaction with the public on social media 

vf is subject to data security and privacy risks that could negatively affect its results operations or reputation 

in the normal course of business we often collect retain and transmit certain sensitive and confidential customer information including credit card information over public networks there is a significant concern by consumers and employees over the security of personal information transmitted over the internet identity theft and user privacy despite the security measures we currently have in place our facilities and systems and those of our thirdparty service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches and vf and its customers could suffer harm if customer information were accessed by third parties due to a security failure in vf’s systems or one of our thirdparty service providers it could require significant expenditures to remediate any such failure or breach severely damage our reputation and our relationships with customers and expose us to risks of litigation and liability in addition as a result of recent security breaches at a number of prominent retailers the media and public scrutiny of information security and privacy has become more intense and the regulatory environment has become more uncertain as a result we may incur significant costs to comply with laws regarding the protection and unauthorized disclosure of personal information 

vf’s business is exposed to the risks of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations vf’s hedging strategies may not be effective in mitigating those risks 

a growing percentage of vf’s total revenues approximately 36 in 2015 is derived from markets outside the us vf’s international businesses operate in functional currencies other than the us dollar changes in currency exchange rates affect the us dollar value of the foreign currencydenominated amounts at which vf’s international businesses purchase products incur costs or sell products in addition for vf’s usbased businesses the majority of products are sourced from independent contractors or vf plants located in foreign countries as a result the cost of these products are affected by changes in the value of the relevant currencies furthermore much of vf’s licensing revenue is derived from sales in foreign currencies changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse impact on vf’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in accordance with our operating practices we hedge a significant portion of our foreign currency transaction exposures arising in the ordinary course of business to reduce risks in our cash flows and earnings our hedging strategy may not be effective in reducing all risks and no hedging strategy can completely insulate vf from foreign exchange risk we do not hedge foreign currency translation rate changes 

further our use of derivative financial instruments may expose vf to counterparty risks although vf only enters into hedging contracts with counterparties having investment grade credit ratings it is possible that the credit quality of a counterparty could be downgraded or a counterparty could default on its obligations which could have a material adverse impact on vf’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

there are risks associated with vf’s acquisitions 

any acquisitions or mergers by vf will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of companies these risks include among other things higher than anticipated acquisition costs and expenses 

  

the difficulty and expense of integrating the operations systems and personnel of the companies and the loss of key employees and customers as a result of changes in management in addition geographic distances may make integration of acquired businesses more difficult we may not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with any acquisitions 

our acquisitions may cause large onetime expenses or create goodwill or other intangible assets that could result in significant impairment charges in the future we also make certain estimates and assumptions in order to determine purchase price allocation and estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed if our estimates or assumptions used to value these assets and liabilities are not accurate we may be exposed to losses that may be material 

vf’s operations and earnings may be affected by legal regulatory political and economic risks 

our ability to maintain the current level of operations in our existing markets and to capitalize on growth in existing and new markets is subject to legal regulatory political and economic risks these include the burdens of complying with us and international laws and regulations unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs or other trade barriers 

we cannot predict whether quotas duties taxes exchange controls or other restrictions will be imposed by the us the european union or other countries on the import or export of our products or what effect any of these actions would have on vf’s business financial condition or results of operations we cannot predict whether there might be changes in our ability to repatriate earnings or capital from international jurisdictions changes in regulatory geopolitical policies and other factors may adversely affect vf’s business or may require us to modify our current business practices 

a significant portion of vf’s 2015 net income was earned in jurisdictions outside the us vf is exposed to risks of changes in us policy for companies having business operations outside the us there have been a number of proposed changes to us income tax laws including overall corporate and individual tax reform some of these tax law changes and tax reform proposals among other things consider accelerating the us taxability of nonus earnings or limiting foreign tax credits while enactment of any such proposal is not certain if new legislation were enacted it is possible our us income tax expense could increase which would reduce our earnings 

we may have additional tax liabilities 

as a global company we determine our income tax liability in various tax jurisdictions based on an analysis and interpretation of local tax laws and regulations this analysis requires a significant amount of judgment and estimation and is often based on various assumptions about the future actions of the local tax authorities these determinations are the subject of periodic us and international tax audits although we accrue for uncertain tax positions our accrual may be insufficient to satisfy unfavorable findings unfavorable audit findings and tax rulings may result in payment of taxes fines and penalties for prior periods and higher tax rates in future periods which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows further in an effort to deal with budget deficits governments around the world are focusing on increasing tax revenues through increased audits and potentially increased tax rates for corporations changes in tax law or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly affect the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements and could significantly impact our profitability 

vf’s balance sheet includes a significant amount of intangible assets and goodwill a decline in the fair value of an intangible asset or of a business unit could result in an asset impairment charge which would be recorded as an operating expense in vf’s consolidated statement of income and could be material 

vf’s policy is to evaluate indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill for possible impairment as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the 

  

fair value of such assets may be below their carrying amount in addition intangible assets that are being amortized are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable for these impairment tests we use various valuation methods to estimate the fair value of our business units and intangible assets if the fair value of an asset is less than its carrying value we would recognize an impairment charge for the difference 

it is possible that we could have an impairment charge for goodwill or trademark and trade name intangible assets in future periods if i overall economic conditions in 2016 or future years vary from our current assumptions ii business conditions or our strategies for a specific business unit change from our current assumptions iii investors require higher rates of return on equity investments in the marketplace or iv enterprise values of comparable publicly traded companies or of actual sales transactions of comparable companies were to decline resulting in lower comparable multiples of revenues and earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and accordingly lower implied values of goodwill and intangible assets a future impairment charge for goodwill or intangible assets could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

vf uses thirdparty suppliers and manufacturing facilities worldwide for a substantial portion of its raw materials and finished products which poses risks to vf’s business operations 

during fiscal 2015 approximately 77 of vf’s units were purchased from independent manufacturers primarily located in asia with substantially all of the remainder produced by vfowned and operated manufacturing facilities located in the us mexico central and south america the caribbean and europe any of the following could impact our ability to produce or deliver vf products 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 although no single supplier and no one country is critical to vf’s production needs if we were to lose a supplier it could result in interruption of finished goods shipments to vf cancellation of orders by customers and termination of relationships this along with the damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on vf’s revenues and consequently our results of operations 

  

our business is subject to national state and local laws and regulations for environmental employment safety and other matters the costs of compliance with or the violation of such laws and regulations by vf or by independent suppliers who manufacture products for vf could have an adverse effect on our operations and cash flows as well as on our reputation 

our business is subject to comprehensive national state and local laws and regulations on a wide range of environmental employment safety and other matters vf could be adversely affected by costs of compliance with or violations of those laws and regulations in addition while we do not control their business practices we require thirdparty suppliers to operate in compliance with applicable laws rules and regulations regarding working conditions employment practices and environmental compliance the costs of products purchased by vf from independent contractors could increase due to the costs of compliance by those contractors 

failure by vf or its thirdparty suppliers to comply with such laws and regulations as well as with ethical social product labor and environmental standards or related political considerations could result in interruption of finished goods shipments to vf cancellation of orders by customers and termination of relationships if one of our independent contractors violates labor or other laws or implements labor or other business practices that are generally regarded as unethical it could jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions including boycotts that may reduce demand for vf’s merchandise damage to vf’s reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on vf’s results of operations financial condition and cash flows as well as require additional resources to rebuild vf’s reputation 

fluctuations in wage rates and the price availability and quality of raw materials and finished goods could increase costs 

fluctuations in the price availability and quality of fabrics leather or other raw materials used by vf in its manufactured products or of purchased finished goods could have a material adverse effect on vf’s cost of goods sold or its ability to meet its customers’ demands the prices we pay depend on demand and market prices for the raw materials used to produce them the price and availability of such raw materials may fluctuate significantly depending on many factors including general economic conditions and demand crop yields energy prices weather patterns and speculation in the commodities markets prices of purchased finished products also depend on wage rates in asia and other geographic areas where our independent contractors are located as well as freight costs from those regions in addition fluctuations in wage rates required by legal or industry standards could increase our costs in the future vf may not be able to offset cost increases with other cost reductions or efficiencies or to pass higher costs on to its customers this could have a material adverse effect on vf’s results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

we may be adversely affected by weather conditions 

our business is adversely affected by unseasonable weather conditions a significant portion of the sales of our products is dependent in part on the weather and is likely to decline in years in which weather conditions do not favor the use of these products periods of unseasonably warm weather in the fall or winter may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows inventory accumulation by our wholesale customers resulting from unseasonable weather in one season generally negatively affects orders in future seasons which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows abnormally harsh or inclement weather can also negatively impact retail traffic and consumer spending 

a substantial portion of vf’s revenues and gross profit is derived from a small number of large customers the loss of any of these customers or the inability of any of these customers to pay vf could substantially reduce vf’s revenues and profits 

a few of vf’s customers account for a significant portion of revenues sales to vf’s ten largest customers were 22 of total revenues in fiscal 2015 with our largest customer accounting for 8 of revenues sales to our 

  

customers are generally on a purchase order basis and not subject to longterm agreements a decision by any of vf’s major customers to significantly decrease the volume of products purchased from vf could substantially reduce revenues and have a material adverse effect on vf’s financial condition and results of operations moreover in recent years the retail industry has experienced consolidation and other ownership changes in the future retailers may further consolidate undergo restructurings or reorganizations realign their affiliations or reposition their stores’ target markets these developments could result in a reduction in the number of stores that carry vf’s products an increase in ownership concentration within the retail industry an increase in credit exposure to vf or an increase in leverage by vf’s customers over their suppliers these changes could impact vf’s opportunities in the market and increase vf’s reliance on a smaller number of large customers 

further the global economy periodically experiences recessionary conditions with rising unemployment reduced availability of credit increased savings rates and declines in real estate and securities values these recessionary conditions could have a negative impact on retail sales of apparel and other consumer products the lower sales volumes along with the possibility of restrictions on access to the credit markets could result in our customers experiencing financial difficulties including store closures bankruptcies or liquidations this could result in higher credit risk to vf relating to receivables from our customers who are experiencing these financial difficulties if these developments occur our inability to shift sales to other customers or to collect on vf’s trade accounts receivable could have a material adverse effect on vf’s financial condition and results of operations 

our ability to obtain shortterm or longterm financing on favorable terms if needed could be adversely affected by geopolitical risk and volatility in the capital markets 

any disruption in the capital markets could limit the availability of funds or the ability or willingness of financial institutions to extend capital in the future this could adversely affect our liquidity and funding resources or significantly increase our cost of capital an inability to access capital and credit markets may have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

vf has a global revolving credit facility one or more of the participating banks may not be able to honor their commitments which could have an adverse effect on vf’s business 

vf has a 175 billion global revolving credit facility that expires in april 2020 if the financial markets return to recessionary conditions this could impair the ability of one or more of the banks participating in our credit agreements to honor their commitments this could have an adverse effect on our business if we were not able to replace those commitments or to locate other sources of liquidity on acceptable terms 

the loss of members of vf’s executive management and other key employees could have a material adverse effect on its business 

vf depends on the services and management experience of its executive officers and business leaders who have substantial experience and expertise in vf’s business vf also depends on other key employees involved in the operation of its business competition for experienced and wellqualified personnel is intense the unexpected loss of services of one or more of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on vf 

vf’s directtoconsumer business includes risks that could have an adverse effect on its results 

vf sells merchandise directtoconsumer through vfoperated stores and ecommerce sites its directtoconsumer business is subject to numerous risks that could have a material adverse effect on its results risks include but are not limited to a us or international resellers purchasing merchandise and reselling it overseas outside vf’s control b failure of the systems that operate the stores and websites and their related support systems including computer viruses theft of customer information privacy concerns telecommunication failures and electronic breakins and similar disruptions c credit card fraud and d risks related to vf’s directtoconsumer distribution centers risks specific to vf’s ecommerce business also include a diversion of sales 

  

from vf stores or wholesale customers b difficulty in recreating the instore experience through direct channels and c liability for online content vf’s failure to successfully respond to these risks might adversely affect sales in its ecommerce business as well as damage its reputation and brands 

our vfoperated stores and ecommerce business require substantial fixed investments in equipment and leasehold improvements information systems inventory and personnel we have entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space due to the high fixedcost structure associated with our directtoconsumer operations a decline in sales or the closure of or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs writeoffs of equipment and leasehold improvements and employeerelated costs 

vf’s net sales depend on the volume of traffic to its stores and the availability of suitable lease space 

a growing portion of our revenues are directtoconsumer sales through vfoperated stores in order to generate customer traffic we locate many of our stores in prominent locations within successful retail shopping centers or in fashionable shopping districts our stores benefit from the ability of the retail center and other attractions in an area to generate consumer traffic in the vicinity of our stores part of our future growth is significantly dependent on our ability to operate stores in desirable locations with capital investment and lease costs providing the opportunity to earn a reasonable return we cannot control the development of new shopping centers or districts the availability or cost of appropriate locations within existing or new shopping centers or districts competition with other retailers for prominent locations or the success of individual shopping centers or districts further if we are unable to renew or replace our existing store leases or enter into leases for new stores on favorable terms or if we violate the terms of our current leases our growth and profitability could be harmed all of these factors may impact our ability to meet our growth targets and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

vf may be unable to protect its trademarks and other intellectual property rights 

vf’s trademarks and other intellectual property rights are important to its success and its competitive position vf is susceptible to others copying its products and infringing its intellectual property rights especially with the shift in product mix to higher priced brands and innovative new products in recent years some of vf’s brands such as the north face ®  timberland ®  vans ®  jansport ®  nautica ®  wrangler ® and lee ®  enjoy significant worldwide consumer recognition and the higher pricing of those products creates additional risk of counterfeiting and infringement 

vf’s trademarks trade names patents trade secrets and other intellectual property are important to vf’s success counterfeiting of vf’s products or infringement on its intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our brands and adversely affect vf’s revenues actions we have taken to establish and protect vf’s intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent copying of its products by others or to prevent others from seeking to invalidate its trademarks or block sales of vf’s products as a violation of the trademarks and intellectual property rights of others in addition unilateral actions in the us or other countries including changes to or the repeal of laws recognizing trademark or other intellectual property rights could have an impact on vf’s ability to enforce those rights 

the value of vf’s intellectual property could diminish if others assert rights in or ownership of trademarks and other intellectual property rights of vf or trademarks that are similar to vf’s trademarks or trademarks that vf licenses from others we may be unable to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction in some cases there may be trademark owners who have prior rights to vf’s trademarks because the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the us in other cases there may be holders who have prior rights to similar trademarks vf is from time to time involved in opposition and cancellation proceedings with respect to some of its intellectual property rights 

  

we may be subject to liability if third parties successfully claim that we infringe on their trademarks copyrights patents or other intellectual property rights defending infringement claims could be expensive and timeconsuming and might result in our entering into costly license agreements 

vf is subject to the risk that its licensees may not generate expected sales or maintain the value of vf’s brands 

during 2015 1261 million of vf’s revenues were derived from licensing royalties although vf generally has significant control over its licensees’ products and advertising we rely on our licensees for among other things operational and financial controls over their businesses failure of our licensees to successfully market licensed products or our inability to replace existing licensees if necessary could adversely affect vf’s revenues both directly from reduced royalties received and indirectly from reduced sales of our other products risks are also associated with a licensee’s ability to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition vf relies on its licensees to help preserve the value of its brands although we attempt to protect vf’s brands through approval rights over design production processes quality packaging merchandising distribution advertising and promotion of our licensed products we cannot completely control the use of licensed vf brands by our licensees the misuse of a brand by a licensee could have a material adverse effect on that brand and on vf 

vf has entered into license agreements to use the trademarks of others loss of a license could have an adverse effect on vf’s operating results 

vf has entered into agreements to market products under licenses granted by third parties including major league baseball the national football league and harleydavidson motor company inc some of these licenses are for a short term and do not contain renewal options loss of a license which in certain cases could result in an impairment charge for related operating and intangible assets could have an adverse effect on vf’s operating results 

if vf encounters problems with its distribution system vf’s ability to deliver its products to the market could be adversely affected 

vf relies on owned or independentlyoperated distribution facilities to warehouse and ship product to its customers vf’s distribution system includes computercontrolled and automated equipment which may be subject to a number of risks related to security or computer viruses the proper operation of software and hardware power interruptions or other system failures because substantially all of vf’s products are distributed from a relatively small number of locations vf’s operations could also be interrupted by earthquakes floods fires or other natural disasters affecting its distribution centers we maintain business interruption insurance but it may not adequately protect vf from the adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in vf’s distribution facilities such as the longterm loss of customers or an erosion of brand image in addition vf’s distribution capacity is dependent on the timely performance of services by third parties including the transportation of product to and from its distribution facilities if we encounter problems with our distribution system our ability to meet customer expectations manage inventory complete sales and achieve operating efficiencies could be materially adversely affected 

  

volatility in securities markets interest rates and other economic factors could substantially increase vf’s defined benefit pension costs 

vf currently has obligations under its defined benefit pension plans the funded status of the pension plans is dependent on many factors including returns on investment assets and the discount rate used to determine pension obligations unfavorable impacts from returns on plan assets decreases in discount rates changes in plan demographics or revisions in the applicable laws or regulations could materially change the timing and amount of pension funding requirements which could reduce cash available for vf’s business 

vf’s operating performance also may be negatively impacted by the amount of expense recorded for its pension plans pension expense is calculated using actuarial valuations that incorporate assumptions and estimates about financial market economic and demographic conditions differences between estimated and actual results give rise to gains and losses that are deferred and amortized as part of future pension expense which can create volatility that adversely impacts vf’s future operating results

 analysis of results of operations 

consolidated statements of income 

the following table presents a summary of the changes in total revenues during the last two years 

 

 vf reported revenue growth of 1 in 2015 primarily attributable to a 3 increase in the outdoor  action sports coalition and continued strength in the international and directtoconsumer businesses partially offset by a negative 5 impact from foreign currency excluding the negative impact from foreign currency sales grew in every region around the world in 2015 additionally 2015 revenue growth was negatively impacted by unseasonably warm weather in the fourth quarter a softer retail environment and the 53 rd week in 2014 the extra week in 2014 negatively impacted 2015 revenue growth comparisons by 1 

  

vf reported revenue growth of 8 in 2014 driven by a 13 increase in the outdoor  action sports coalition and continued strength in the international and directtoconsumer businesses the extra week in 2014 added approximately 1 of growth compared to 2013 additional details on revenues are provided in the section titled “information by business segment” 

vf’s most significant foreign currency exposure relates to business conducted in eurobased countries however vf conducts business in other developed and emerging markets around the world with exposure to foreign currencies other than the euro the strengthening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies negatively impacted revenue comparisons in 2015 as discussed above 

the following table presents the percentage relationship to total revenues for components of the consolidated statements of income 

 

 gross margin declined 50 basis points to 483 in 2015 compared with 488 in 2014 primarily due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations which negatively impacted gross margin by 80 basis points in 2015 compared with 2014 excluding this impact gross margin improved 30 basis points in 2015 due to lower product costs and the continued shift in our revenue mix towards higher margin businesses including outdoor  action sports directtoconsumer and international partially offset by aggressive efforts to manage inventory levels 

in 2014 gross margin increased 70 basis points to 488 compared with 481 in 2013 with improvements in nearly every coalition the increase in gross margin reflected the continued shift in our revenue mix towards higher margin businesses including outdoor  action sports international and directtoconsumer in addition the 2014 change in classification of retail concession fees improved gross margin by 20 basis points and increased the ratio of selling general and administration expenses to revenues compared with 2013 

selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased 10 basis points in 2015 compared with 2014 this decrease is primarily due to lower incentive compensation leverage of operating expenses on higher revenues and the benefit from a 166 million gain on the sale of a vf outlet ® location in 2015 partially offset by increased investments in our directtoconsumer businesses and global product development which includes our strategic innovation centers 

selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues were 30 basis points higher in 2014 compared with 2013 excluding the impact of the aforementioned change in classification of retail concession fees the percentage of selling general and administrative expenses to revenues did not change in 2014 compared with 2013 as the impact from increased investments in directtoconsumer businesses and marketing was offset by the leverage of operating expenses on higher revenues 

as part of its annual impairment testing performed in the fourth quarter of 2015 vf recorded a 1436 million pretax noncash impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of intangible assets related to our 7 for all mankind ®  splendid ® and ella moss ® brands to their respective estimated fair values in the fourth quarter of 2014 vf recorded a 3964 million pretax noncash impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets related to these same brands no impairment charge was required in 2013 for additional information see notes e f and s to the consolidated financial statements and the “critical accounting policies and estimates” section below 

  

in 2015 operating margin increased 170 basis points to 134 from 117 in 2014 the increase in operating margin reflects a lower impairment charge for intangible assets in 2015 compared with 2014 

in 2014 operating margin declined 270 basis points to 117 from 144 in 2013 the decrease in operating margin for 2014 reflects gross margin expansion and a 320 basis point decrease from the noncash impairment charge for goodwill and intangible assets 

net interest expense increased 24 million to 823 million in 2015 the increase in net interest expense was primarily due to higher average levels of shortterm borrowings net interest expense decreased 08 million to 798 million in 2014 due to the repayment of 400 million of floating rate notes during the third quarter of 2013 and increased interest income on cash equivalents partially offset by higher average levels of shortterm borrowings in 2014 

outstanding interestbearing debt averaged 24 billion for 2015 18 billion for 2014 and 19 billion for 2013 with shortterm borrowings representing 41 22 and 10 of average debt outstanding for the respective years the weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt was 35 in 2015 46 for 2014 and 45 for 2013 the weighted average interest rate decreased in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily due to the increase in average levels of shortterm borrowings at lower interest rates the weighted average interest rate increased slightly in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to higher interest rates on international shortterm borrowings 

other income expense netted to income of 17 million in 2015 compared with expense of 55 million and 40 million in 2014 and 2013 respectively the income in 2015 was due primarily to net foreign currency exchange gains compared to net foreign currency exchange losses in both 2014 and 2013 

the effective income tax rate was 221 in 2015 compared with 225 in 2014 the 2015 tax rate included a net discrete tax benefit of 440 million which included 362 million of tax benefits related to the settlement of tax audits and 46 million related to the retroactive impact of the protecting americans from tax hikes “path” act of 2015 as discussed below the 440 million tax benefit in 2015 reduced the effective income tax rate by 28 compared with a 10 impact of discrete items in 2014 without discrete items the effective tax rate during 2015 increased by approximately 13 primarily due to i a lower percentage of foreign earnings in 2015 reflecting the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates ii the expiration of a favorable tax ruling in a foreign jurisdiction at the end of fiscal 2014 and iii the comparative impact of tax benefits recorded in 2014 related to the utilization of foreign tax attributes the international effective tax rate was 125 and 127 for 2015 and 2014 respectively vf expects the 2016 annual tax rate to approximate 230 

the path act of 2015 signed into law in december 2015 permanently extended the us federal research tax credit and extended certain tax credits and other incentives the path act was retroactive to january 1 2015 and the impact was considered a discrete tax benefit when recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015 

the effective income tax rate was 225 in 2014 compared with 226 in 2013 the 2014 tax rate included a net discrete tax benefit of 138 million primarily related to unrecognized tax benefits and interest net 114 million tax benefit and the retroactive impact of the tax increase prevention act of 2014 discussed below 53 million tax benefit partially offset by other discrete tax items net 29 million tax expense these discrete items collectively lowered the 2014 annual tax rate by 10 compared with a 17 impact of discrete items in 2013 without discrete items the effective tax rate during 2014 decreased by approximately 07 the international effective tax rate was 127 and 121 for 2014 and 2013 respectively 

the tax increase prevention act of 2014 signed into law in december 2014 retroactively extended certain tax credits and incentives through tax year 2014 the impact of this tax law change to the 2014 tax year was considered a discrete tax benefit when recorded in the fourth quarter of 2014 

  

as a result of the above net income in 2015 increased to 12 billion 285 per share compared with 10 billion 238 per share in 2014 and 12 billion 271 per share in 2013 the increase in earnings per share in 2015 compared with 2014 reflects the lower intangible asset impairment charge 023 per share in 2015 compared with 070 per share in 2014 and improved operating performance partially offset by the negative impact from foreign currency the decrease in earnings per share in 2014 compared with 2013 reflects the goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge in 2014 partially offset by improved operating performance refer to additional discussion in the “information by business segment” section below 

information by business segment 

management at each of the coalitions has direct control over and responsibility for its revenues and operating income hereinafter termed “coalition revenues” and “coalition profit” respectively vf management evaluates operating performance and makes investment and other decisions based on coalition revenues and coalition profit common costs such as information systems processing retirement benefits and insurance are allocated to the coalitions based on appropriate metrics such as sales usage or employment

 the sportswear coalition consists of the nautica ® and kipling ® brand businesses in north america the kipling ® brand outside of north america is managed by the outdoor  action sports coalition 

coalition revenues decreased 2 in 2015 over 2014 partially due to the impact of the 53 rd week in 2014 nautica ® brand revenues decreased 4 in 2015 due in part to the unseasonably warm weather in the fourth quarter which reduced consumer demand for fleece sweaters and outerwear nautica ® brand directtoconsumer revenues were down 9 in 2015 compared with 2014 due to reduced traffic and the exit of less profitable stores wholesale revenues for the nautica ® brand were only down 1 in 2015 despite continuing challenges in the us department store channel kipling ® brand revenues in north america increased 8 driven by growth in the directtoconsumer and wholesale channels

operating margin decreased 350 basis points in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to the cost of store openings and reduced expense leverage on a lower revenue base 

as part of its annual impairment testing performed in the fourth quarter of 2015 vf recorded a 1436 million pretax noncash impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of intangible assets related to the 7 for all mankind ®  splendid ® and ella moss ® brands to their respective estimated fair values in the fourth quarter of 2014 vf recorded a 3964 million pretax noncash impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill and intangible assets related to these same brands these charges were excluded from the coalition profit of contemporary brands since they are not part of the ongoing operations of the business for additional information see notes e f and s to the consolidated financial statements and the “critical accounting policies and estimates” section below 

other 

 

 vf outlet ® stores in the us sell vf products at prices that are generally higher than what could be realized through external wholesale channels as well as other nonvf products revenues and profits of vf products sold in these stores are reported as part of the operating results of the applicable coalition while revenues and profits of nonvf products are reported in this “other” category the increase in profit in 2015 is primarily due to a 166 million gain recognized on the sale of a vf outlet ® location in 2015 

  

reconciliation of coalition profit to consolidated income before income taxes 

there are three types of costs necessary to reconcile total coalition profit to consolidated income before income taxes these costs are i noncash impairment of goodwill and intangible assets which is excluded from coalition profit because these costs are not part of the ongoing operations of the respective businesses ii interest expense net which is excluded from coalition profit because substantially all financing costs are managed at the corporate office and are not under the control of coalition management and iii corporate and other expenses discussed below which are excluded from coalition profit to the extent they are not allocated to the coalitions impairment of goodwill and intangible assets and net interest expense are discussed in the “consolidated statements of income” section and corporate and other expenses are discussed below 

following is a summary of vf’s corporate and other expenses 

 

 information systems and shared services 

these costs include management information systems and the centralized finance supply chain human resources directtoconsumer and customer management functions that support worldwide operations operating costs of information systems and shared services are charged to the coalitions based on utilization of those services costs to develop new computer applications are generally not allocated to the coalitions the increases in information systems and shared services costs in 2015 and 2014 resulted from the overall growth of the businesses and costs associated with expanded software system implementations and upgrades 

corporate headquarters’ costs 

headquarters’ costs include compensation and benefits of corporate management and staff legal and professional fees and general and administrative expenses that have not been allocated to the coalitions the decrease in corporate headquarters’ costs in 2015 compared with 2014 was primarily driven by decreases in cash and stockbased compensation expense resulting from lower corporate performance versus established goals partially offset by additional investments in our global innovation centers the increase in corporate headquarters’ costs in 2014 over 2013 was primarily driven by increases in cash and stockbased compensation expense resulting from corporate performance in excess of established goals and increases in vf’s share price 

other 

this category includes i costs of corporate programs or corporatemanaged decisions that are not allocated to the coalitions ii costs of registering maintaining and enforcing certain of vf’s trademarks and iii miscellaneous consolidated costs the most significant of which is related to the expense of vf’s centrallymanaged us defined benefit pension plans the decrease in other expense in 2015 compared with 2014 was driven by a decrease in the value of vf’s deferred compensation liability partially offset by higher pension expense the decrease in other expenses in 2014 compared with 2013 was driven by lower pension expense 

  

international operations 

international revenues declined 4 in 2015 compared with growth of 9 in 2014 the decline in 2015 is due to foreign currency which negatively impacted international revenue growth by 13 revenues in europe declined 11 reflecting operational growth that was more than offset by a 16 negative impact from foreign currency in the asia pacific region revenues increased 9 primarily driven by strong growth in china foreign currency negatively impacted growth in the asia pacific region by 4 revenues in the americas nonus region decreased 1 as weakening currencies in the region relative to the us dollar negatively impacted growth by 15 international revenues represented 36 and 38 of total vf revenues in 2015 and 2014 respectively 

directtoconsumer operations 

directtoconsumer revenues grew 3 in 2015 compared with growth of 19 in 2014 the increase in 2015 was driven by operational growth in all regions and growth in nearly every brand with a retail format the directtoconsumer revenue increase in 2015 was partially offset by a negative 4 impact from foreign currency primarily in europe and a negative 3 impact from the additional week included in the 2014 results new store openings and comparable sales growth which includes an expanding ecommerce business all contributed to directtoconsumer revenue growth vf opened 186 stores in 2015 bringing the total number of vfowned retail stores to 1520 at december 2015 directtoconsumer revenues were 27 of total vf revenues in 2015 compared with 26 in 2014 

analysis of financial condition 

balance sheets 

the following discussion refers to significant changes in balances at december 2015 compared with december 2014 

 

  

  

  

  

 the funded status of the defined benefit pension plans is reflected in the balance sheet as the excess or deficiency of pension plan assets compared with projected benefit obligations payable to plan participants the underfunded status of the defined benefit pension plans was 1566 million at the end of 2015 compared with 3717 million at the end of 2014 the underfunded status includes a 1269 million liability related to our unfunded us nonqualified defined benefit plan 343 million of net liabilities related to our nonus defined benefit plans and a 46 million asset related to our us qualified defined benefit plan the improvement in the funded status as of december 2015 was due to i an increase in plan assets resulting from a 2500 million discretionary contribution in 2015 partially offset by a lower return on plan assets and ii a decrease in projected benefit obligations caused primarily by higher discount rates see the “critical accounting policies and estimates” section below and note l to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the defined benefit pension plans 

  

liquidity and cash flows 

the financial condition of vf is reflected in the following 

 

 for the ratio of debt to total capital debt is defined as shortterm and longterm borrowings and total capital is defined as debt plus stockholders’ equity the increase in the debt to total capital ratio at december 2015 compared with 2014 was primarily due to the increase in shortterm borrowings as explained above and a reduction in stockholders’ equity due to the increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss reflecting the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the 1436 million noncash impairment charge of intangible assets recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015 

vf’s primary source of liquidity is the strong annual cash flow provided by operating activities cash from operations is typically lower in the first half of the year as inventory builds to support peak sales periods in the second half of the year cash provided by operating activities in the second half of the year is substantially higher as inventories are sold and accounts receivable are collected additionally directtoconsumer sales are highest in the fourth quarter of the year 

in summary our cash flows were as follows 

 

 cash provided by operating activities 

cash flow provided by operating activities is dependent on the level of net income and changes in working capital cash provided by operating activities declined 5511 million in 2015 primarily due to i a 2500 million discretionary contribution to the us qualified pension plan in 2015 ii an increase in net cash usage from working capital changes due in part to higher inventory levels at the end of 2015 as discussed above iii lower cash collections in 2015 due to the extra week in 2014 and iv the negative impact of foreign currency exchange 

although net income decreased in 2014 due to the impairment charge for goodwill and intangible assets cash provided by operations increased in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to i improved operating performance ii increased accounts receivable collections during the 53 rd week and iii the net impact of changes in noncash adjustments primarily related to pension obligations impairment charges depreciation and amortization and deferred taxes these cash flow increases were partially offset by the impact of higher inventory levels at the end of 2014 compared with 2013 due to anticipated revenue growth in the first quarter of 2015 

cash used by investing activities 

vf’s investing activities in 2015 related primarily to capital expenditures of 2545 million and software purchases of 633 million partially offset by 167 million of proceeds from the sale of a vf outlet ® location capital expenditures increased 204 million compared with 2014 primarily due to the purchase of a headquarters building in the outdoor  action sports coalition software purchases decreased 47 million in 2015 primarily due to the completion of a major system implementation that incurred significant costs throughout 2014 and 

  

through the middle of 2015 the decrease in software purchases was partially offset by the timing of payments to vendors as a significant amount of payments for software purchases near the end of 2014 were made in early 2015 vf expects capital spending to approximate 3000 million in 2016 to support continued growth this spending is expected to be funded by cash flow from operations 

vf’s investing activities in 2014 related primarily to capital expenditures of 2341 million and software purchases of 679 million capital expenditures decreased 371 million in 2014 compared with 2013 due to the completion of a number of significant projects during 2013 software purchases increased 140 million over the 2013 period due to system implementations and a new software license agreement that supports our ecommerce infrastructure and other key business functions 

cash used by financing activities 

the decrease in cash used by financing activities in 2015 compared with 2014 was driven by the 4275 million increase in shortterm borrowings discussed in “balance sheets” above partially offset by an increase of 863 million in cash dividends paid in 2015 

the increase in cash used by financing activities in 2014 compared with 2013 was driven by an increase of 4458 million in open market purchases of common stock and an increase of 768 million in cash dividends paid partially offset by a 4001 million decrease in payments of longterm debt 

during 2015 2014 and 2013 vf purchased 100 million 120 million and 68 million shares respectively of its common stock in open market transactions the respective cost was 7326 million 7278 million and 2821 million with an average price per share of 7300 in 2015 6046 in 2014 and 4119 in 2013 

as of the end of 2015 the company had 307 million shares remaining under its current share repurchase program authorized by vf’s board of directors from january 4 2016 to february 26 2016 the company repurchased approximately 50 million shares of common stock in open market transactions for 3018 million average price per share of 5990 vf will continue to evaluate its use of capital giving first priority to business acquisitions and then to direct shareholder return in the form of dividends and share repurchases 

in april 2015 vf entered into a 175 billion senior unsecured revolving line of credit the “global credit facility” which supports the 175 billion us commercial paper program described below the global credit facility expires in april 2020 and vf may request two extensions of one year each subject to stated terms and conditions the global credit facility replaced vf’s 125 billion revolving credit facility that was scheduled to expire in december 2016 the global credit facility may be used to borrow funds in both us dollar and nonus dollar currencies and has a 500 million letter of credit sublimit borrowings under the global credit facility are priced at a credit spread of 805 basis points over the appropriate libor benchmark for each currency vf is also required to pay a facility fee to the lenders currently equal to 70 basis points of the committed amount of the facility the credit spread and facility fee are subject to adjustment based on vf’s credit ratings 

vf has a commercial paper program that allows for borrowings of up to 175 billion to the extent that it has borrowing capacity under the global credit facility commercial paper borrowings and standby letters of credit issued as of december 2015 were 4230 million and 173 million respectively leaving 13097 million available for borrowing against the global credit facility at december 2015 

vf has 1101 million of international lines of credit with various banks which are uncommitted and may be terminated at any time by either vf or the banks borrowings under these arrangements had a weighted average interest rate of 60 and 53 at december 2015 and 2014 respectively excluding accepted letters of credit which are noninterest bearing to vf total outstanding balances under these arrangements were 266 million and 218 million at december 2015 and 2014 respectively 

  

vf’s favorable credit agency ratings allow for access to additional liquidity at competitive rates at the end of 2015 vf’s longterm debt ratings were ‘a’ by standard  poor’s ratings services and ‘a3’ by moody’s investors service and commercial paper ratings by those rating agencies were ‘a1’ and ‘prime2’ respectively none of vf’s longterm debt agreements contain acceleration of maturity clauses based solely on changes in credit ratings however if there were a change in control of vf and as a result of the change in control the 2017 2021 and 2037 notes were rated below investment grade by recognized rating agencies vf would be obligated to repurchase the notes at 101 of the aggregate principal amount of notes repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest 

cash dividends totaled 133 per share in 2015 compared with 11075 in 2014 and 09150 in 2013 the dividend payout rate was 467 of diluted earnings per share in 2015 432 excluding the effects of the noncash intangible asset impairment charge 465 in 2014 360 excluding the effects of the noncash goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge and 338 in 2013 based on the quarterly dividend in place the current indicated annual dividend rate for 2016 is 148 per share 

as of december 2015 approximately 6975 million of cash and shortterm investments was held by international subsidiaries whose undistributed earnings are considered permanently reinvested vf’s intent is to reinvest these funds in international operations if management decides at a later date to repatriate these funds to the us vf would be required to provide taxes on these amounts based on applicable us tax rates net of foreign taxes already paid 

following is a summary of vf’s contractual obligations and commercial commitments at the end of 2015 that will require the use of funds 

 

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

 vf had other financial commitments at the end of 2015 that are not included in the above table but may require the use of funds under certain circumstances 

 

  

  

  

 management believes that vf’s cash balances and funds provided by operating activities as well as its global credit facility additional borrowing capacity and access to capital markets taken as a whole provide i adequate liquidity to meet all of its current and longterm obligations when due ii adequate liquidity to fund capital expenditures and to maintain the planned dividend payout rate and iii flexibility to meet investment opportunities that may arise 

vf does not participate in transactions with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships established to facilitate offbalance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes

at the end of 2015 vf’s defined benefit pension plans were underfunded by a net total of 1566 million the underfunded status includes a 1269 million liability related to our unfunded us nonqualified defined benefit plan 343 million of net liabilities related to our nonus defined benefit plans and a 46 million asset related to our us qualified defined benefit plan vf has made significant cash contributions in recent years to improve the funded status of its plans including discretionary contributions to the us qualified plan of 2500 million in 2015 and 500 million in 2014 vf will continue to evaluate the funded status and future funding requirements of these plans which depends in part on the future performance of the plans’ investment portfolios management believes that vf has sufficient liquidity to make any required contributions to the pension plans in future years 

vf’s reported earnings are subject to risks due to the volatility of its pension expense pension expense has ranged from 579 million to 895 million over the last three years with the fluctuations primarily due to varying amounts of actuarial gains and losses that are deferred and amortized to future years’ expense the assumptions that impact actuarial gains and losses include the rate of return on investments held by the pension plans the discount rate used to value participant liabilities and demographic characteristics of the participants 

vf has taken several steps to manage the risk and volatility in the pension plans and their impact on the financial statements in 2005 vf’s us defined benefit plans were closed to new entrants which did not affect the benefits of existing plan participants at that date or their accrual of future benefits in more recent years the investment strategy of the us defined benefit plan has been revised to define dynamic asset allocation targets that are dependent upon changes in the plan’s funded status capital market expectations and risk tolerance management will continue to evaluate actions that may help to reduce vf’s risks related to its defined benefit plans 

interest rate risks 

vf limits the risk of interest rate fluctuations by managing the mix of fixed and variable interest rate debt in addition vf may use derivative financial instruments to manage risk since a significant portion of vf’s longterm debt has fixed interest rates the exposure primarily relates to changes in interest rates on variable rate shortterm borrowings which averaged 10 billion during 2015 however any change in interest rates would also affect interest income earned on vf’s cash equivalents based on the average amount of variable rate borrowings and cash equivalents during 2015 the effect of a hypothetical 1 increase in interest rates would be a decrease in reported net income of approximately 57 million 

foreign currency exchange rate risks 

vf is a global enterprise subject to the risk of foreign currency fluctuations approximately 36 of vf’s revenues in 2015 were generated in international markets most of vf’s foreign businesses operate in functional currencies other than the us dollar in periods where the us dollar strengthens relative to the euro or other foreign currencies where vf has operations there is a negative impact on vf’s operating results upon translation of those foreign operating results into the us dollar vf does not hedge the translation of foreign currency operating results into the us dollar however management does hedge foreign currency transactions as discussed later in this section 

the reported values of assets and liabilities in these foreign businesses are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for net advances to and investments in vf’s foreign businesses that are considered to 

  

be longterm the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on those longterm advances are deferred as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders’ equity the us dollar value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries fluctuates with changes in the underlying functional currencies vf generally does not hedge this balance sheet translation exposure 

vf monitors net foreign currency market exposures and enters into derivative foreign currency contracts to hedge the effects of exchange rate fluctuations for a significant portion of forecasted foreign currency cash flows or specific foreign currency transactions relating to crossborder inventory purchases production costs product sales operating costs and intercompany royalty payments vf’s practice is to buy or sell foreign currency exchange contracts that cover up to 80 of foreign currency exposures for periods of up to 24 months currently vf uses only forward foreign currency exchange contracts but may use options or collars in the future this use of financial instruments allows management to reduce the overall exposure to risks from exchange rate fluctuations on vf’s cash flows and earnings since gains and losses on these contracts will offset losses and gains on the transactions being hedged 

for cash flow hedging contracts outstanding at the end of 2015 if there were a hypothetical change in foreign currency exchange rates of 10 compared with rates at the end of 2015 it would result in a change in fair value of those contracts of approximately 1724 million however any change in the fair value of the hedging contracts would be substantially offset by a change in the fair value of the underlying hedged exposure impacted by the currency rate changes 

counterparty risks 

vf is exposed to creditrelated losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to derivative hedging instruments to manage this risk we have established counterparty credit guidelines and only enter into derivative transactions with financial institutions with ‘a minusa3’ investment grade credit ratings or better vf continually monitors the credit rating of and limits the amount hedged with each counterparty additionally management utilizes a portfolio of financial institutions to minimize exposure to potential counterparty defaults and adjusts positions as necessary vf also monitors counterparty risk for derivative contracts within the defined benefit pension plans 

commodity price risks 

vf is exposed to market risks for the pricing of cotton leather rubber wool and other materials which we either purchase directly or in a converted form such as fabric or shoe soles to manage risks of commodity price changes management negotiates prices in advance when possible vf has not historically managed commodity price exposures by using derivative instruments 

deferred compensation and related investment security risks 

vf has nonqualified deferred compensation plans in which liabilities to the plans’ participants are based on the market values of the participants’ selection of a hypothetical portfolio of investment funds including vf common stock vf invests in a portfolio of securities that substantially mirrors the participants’ investment selections the increases and decreases in deferred compensation liabilities except for the participants’ investment selections in vf common stock are substantially offset by corresponding increases and decreases in the market value of vf’s investments resulting in an insignificant net exposure to operating results and financial position the vf common stock is treated as treasury shares for financial reporting purposes so any gains or losses on those shares result in exposure to operating results and financial position as a result of the change in participant liabilities 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

vf has chosen accounting policies that management believes are appropriate to accurately and fairly report vf’s operating results and financial position in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the 

  

us vf applies these accounting policies in a consistent manner significant accounting policies are summarized in note a to the consolidated financial statements 

the application of these accounting policies requires that vf make estimates and assumptions about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses contingent assets and liabilities and related disclosures these estimates assumptions and judgments are based on historical experience current trends and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis because vf’s business cycle is relatively short ie from the date that inventory is received until that inventory is sold and the trade receivable is collected actual results related to most estimates are known within a few months after any balance sheet date in addition vf may retain outside specialists to assist in valuations of business acquisitions impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets equity compensation pension benefits and selfinsured liabilities if actual results ultimately differ from previous estimates the revisions are included in results of operations when the actual amounts become known 

vf believes the following accounting policies involve the most significant management estimates assumptions and judgments used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements or are the most sensitive to change from outside factors the application of these critical accounting policies and estimates is discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors 

inventories 

vf’s inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value cost includes all material labor and overhead costs incurred to manufacture or purchase the finished goods overhead allocated to manufactured product is based on the normal capacity of plants and does not include amounts related to idle capacity or abnormal production inefficiencies vf performs a detailed review at each business unit at least quarterly of all inventories on the basis of individual styles or individual stylesizecolor stock keeping units to identify slow moving or excess products discontinued and tobediscontinued products and offquality merchandise this review matches inventory on hand plus current production and purchase commitments with current and expected future sales orders management performs an evaluation to estimate net realizable value using a systematic and consistent methodology of forecasting future demand market conditions and selling prices less costs of disposal if the estimated net realizable value is less than cost vf provides an allowance to reflect the lower value of that inventory this methodology recognizes inventory exposures at the time such losses are evident rather than at the time goods are actually sold historically these estimates of future demand and selling prices have not varied significantly from actual results due to vf’s timely identification and rapid disposal of these distressed inventories 

existence of physical inventory is verified through periodic physical inventory counts and ongoing cycle counts at most locations throughout the year vf provides for estimated inventory losses that have likely occurred since the last physical inventory date historically physical inventory shrinkage has not been significant 

longlived assets including goodwill and intangible assets 

vf allocates the purchase price of an acquired business to the fair values of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed with any excess purchase price recorded as goodwill vf evaluates fair value at acquisition using three valuation techniques — the replacement cost market and income methods — and weights the valuation methods based on what is most appropriate in the circumstances the process of assigning fair values particularly to acquired intangible assets is highly subjective 

fair value for acquired intangible assets is generally based on the present value of expected cash flows indefinitelived trademark or trade name intangible assets collectively referred to herein as “trademarks” represent individually acquired trademarks some of which are registered in multiple countries definitelived 

  

customer relationship intangible assets are based on the value of relationships with wholesale customers at the time of acquisition definitelived license intangible assets relate to numerous licensing contracts with vf as either the licensor or licensee goodwill represents the excess of cost of an acquired business over the fair value of net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired and is assigned at the reporting unit level 

vf’s depreciation policies for property plant and equipment reflect judgments on their estimated economic lives and residual value if any vf’s amortization policies for definitelived intangible assets reflect judgments on the estimated amounts and duration of future cash flows expected to be generated by those assets in evaluating the amortizable life for customer relationship intangible assets management considers historical attrition patterns for various groups of customers for licenserelated intangible assets management considers historical trends and anticipated license renewal periods 

vf’s policy is to review property plant and equipment and definitelived intangible assets for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable vf tests for potential impairment at the asset or asset group level which is the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent vf measures recoverability of the carrying value of an asset or asset group by comparison with the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if the forecasted undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset are not expected to be adequate to recover the asset’s carrying value a fair value analysis must be performed and an impairment charge is recorded if there is an excess of the asset’s carrying value over its estimated fair value 

when testing customer relationship intangible assets for potential impairment management considers historical customer attrition rates and projected revenues and profitability related to customers that existed at acquisition management uses the multiperiod excess earnings method which is a specific application of the discounted cash flow method to value customer relationship assets under this method vf calculates the present value of the aftertax cash flows expected to be generated by the customer relationship asset after deducting contributory asset charges 

vf’s policy is to evaluate indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill for possible impairment as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of such assets may be below their carrying amount as part of its annual impairment testing vf may elect to assess qualitative factors as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform quantitative impairment testing if management’s assessment of these qualitative factors indicates that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset or reporting unit is less than its carrying value then no further testing is required otherwise the intangible asset or reporting unit must be quantitatively tested for impairment 

an indefinitelived intangible asset is quantitatively tested for possible impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset with its carrying value fair value of an indefinitelived trademark is based on an income approach using the relieffromroyalty method under this method forecasted revenues for products sold with the trademark are assigned a royalty rate that would be charged to license the trademark in lieu of ownership and the fair value is calculated as the present value of those forecasted royalties avoided by owning the trademark the appropriate discount rate is based on the reporting unit’s weighted average cost of capital “wacc” that considers market participant assumptions plus a spread that factors in the risk of the intangible asset the royalty rate is selected based on consideration of i royalty rates included in active license agreements if applicable ii royalty rates received by market participants in the apparel industry and iii the current performance of the reporting unit if the estimated fair value of the trademark intangible asset exceeds its carrying value there is no impairment charge if the estimated fair value of the trademark is less than its carrying value an impairment charge would be recognized for the difference 

goodwill is quantitatively evaluated for possible impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value reporting units are businesses with discrete financial information that is 

  

available and reviewed by coalition management in the first step of the quantitative goodwill impairment test vf compares the carrying value of a reporting unit including its recorded goodwill to the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 

for goodwill impairment testing vf estimates the fair value of a reporting unit using both incomebased and marketbased valuation methods the incomebased approach is based on the reporting unit’s forecasted future cash flows that are discounted to present value using the reporting unit’s wacc discussed above for the marketbased approach management uses both the guideline company and similar transaction methods the guideline company method analyzes market multiples of revenues and earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” for a group of comparable public companies the market multiples used in the valuation are based on the relative strengths and weaknesses of the reporting unit compared to the selected guideline companies under the similar transactions method valuation multiples are calculated utilizing actual transaction prices and revenueebitda data from target companies deemed similar to the reporting unit 

based on the range of estimated fair values developed from the income and marketbased methods vf determines the estimated fair value for the reporting unit if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value the goodwill is not impaired and no further review is required however if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value vf performs the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the impairment charge if any the second step involves a hypothetical allocation of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill and liabilities as if the reporting unit were newly acquired which results in an implied fair value of the goodwill the amount of the impairment charge is the excess of the recorded goodwill if any over the implied fair value of the goodwill 

the incomebased fair value methodology requires management’s assumptions and judgments regarding economic conditions in the markets in which vf operates and conditions in the capital markets many of which are outside of management’s control at the reporting unit level fair value estimation requires management’s assumptions and judgments regarding the effects of overall economic conditions on the specific reporting unit along with assessment of the reporting unit’s strategies and forecasts of future cash flows forecasts of individual reporting unit cash flows involve management’s estimates and assumptions regarding 

 

  

  

 under the marketbased fair value methodology judgment is required in evaluating market multiples and recent transactions management believes that the assumptions used for its impairment tests are representative of those that would be used by market participants performing similar valuations of vf’s reporting units 

management concluded that there were no triggering events that caused us to test goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets prior to our annual impairment testing date on the first day of the fourth quarter which coincided with the timing of the severe performance decline in the contemporary brands coalition as such management performed its annual goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment testing as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2015 vf elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative analysis for the timberland ® and reef ® reporting units and for the timberland ®  reef ®  rock  

  

republic ®  splendid ® and ella moss ®  and 7 for all mankind ® trademark intangible assets management performed a qualitative analysis for all other reporting units and trademark intangible assets as discussed below in the “other reporting units — qualitative impairment analysis” section 

timberland ® impairment analysis 

as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2015 vf performed a quantitative impairment analysis of the goodwill and trademark intangible asset for the timberland ® reporting unit and concluded that both the goodwill and the trademark were not impaired the estimated fair values of the goodwill and trademark intangible asset exceeded their respective carrying values by a significant amount 

the timberland ® reporting unit acquired in 2011 sells outdoor adventureinspired lifestyle footwear apparel and accessories for men women and children products are sold globally through multiple wholesale and directtoconsumer channels 

the timberland ® reporting unit has experienced strong revenue and profit growth in recent years primarily due to product innovation and heightened brand awareness which has led to solid performance in the wholesale and ecommerce businesses key assumptions developed by vf management and used in our quantitative analysis of the timberland ® reporting unit and trademark asset include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 actual results for the timberland ® reporting unit may vary from projected results accordingly management performed sensitivity analysis on the impairment models and concluded that the reporting unit goodwill and trademark intangible asset were not impaired even with significant negative changes made to key assumptions for example a 50 decrease in the forecasted cumulative average revenue growth rate used in the trademark intangible asset impairment model did not cause its estimated fair value to decline below carrying value similarly for goodwill a 50 decrease in projected cash flows did not cause the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to decline below its carrying value separately a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate did not cause the estimated fair values of the timberland ® reporting unit or trademark intangible asset to decline below their respective carrying values 

reef ® impairment analysis 

as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2015 vf performed a quantitative impairment analysis of the goodwill and trademark intangible asset for the reef ® reporting unit and concluded that both the goodwill and the trademark were not impaired the estimated fair values of the goodwill and trademark intangible asset exceeded their respective carrying values by a significant amount 

the reef ® reporting unit acquired in 2005 sells surfinspired products including sandals shoes swimwear casual apparel and accessories for men women and children products are sold through the wholesale channel and online primarily in north america as well as in european and south american markets as part of the 2009 annual impairment analysis a portion of the reef ® goodwill 311 million and trademark 56 million was written down to estimated fair values of 483 million and 744 million respectively 

  

recent performance by the brand has been negatively impacted by isolated events such as an unseasonably cold spring in 2014 and supplier issues in 2015 however vf is optimistic about the brand because of the oneoff nature of these recent occurrences that negatively impacted sales the success of recent product introductions and continued operational growth in europe key assumptions developed by vf management and used in our quantitative analysis of the reef ® reporting unit and trademark asset include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 actual results for the reef ® reporting unit may vary from projected results accordingly management performed sensitivity analysis on the impairment models and concluded that the reporting unit goodwill and trademark intangible asset were not impaired even with significant negative changes made to key assumptions for example a 50 decrease in the forecasted cumulative average revenue growth rate used in the trademark intangible asset impairment model did not cause its estimated fair value to decline below carrying value similarly for goodwill a 50 decrease in projected cash flows did not cause the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to decline below its carrying value separately a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate did not cause the estimated fair values of the reef ® reporting unit or trademark intangible asset to decline below their respective carrying values 

rock  republic ® impairment analysis 

as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2015 vf performed a quantitative impairment analysis of the trademark intangible asset for the rock  republic ® brand and concluded that the trademark was not impaired the estimated fair value of the trademark intangible asset exceeded its carrying value of 581 million by 4 

the rock  republic ® brand was acquired in 2011 and has an exclusive wholesale distribution and licensing arrangement with kohl’s corporation recent performance of the brand has been negatively impacted by challenging consumer trends in the women’s denim category 

vf expects that recent price changes new product launches and increased marketing and supply chain initiatives in collaboration with kohl’s will improve the brand’s performance in future periods key assumptions developed by vf management and used in our quantitative analysis of the rock  republic ® trademark asset include 

 

  

  

 in february 2016 vf and kohl’s agreed to renew the contract for an additional threeyear term with four optional threeyear renewal periods the terms of the agreement are consistent with the assumptions used in our analysis however actual results for the rock and republic ® brand may vary from projected results additionally because our quantitative analysis shows that the estimated fair value of the trademark is essentially equal to its carrying value any negative variances from our assumptions would result in a decrease in 

  

fair value and a potential impairment charge for example a 10 decrease in the forecasted cumulative average revenue growth rate for the licensing business or a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate would cause the estimated fair value of the trademark to decline below its carrying value 

splendid ® and ella moss ® impairment analysis 

vf performed a fair value assessment of the trademark intangible asset for the splendid ® and ella moss ® reporting unit as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2015 and recorded a 153 million impairment charge 

the splendid ® and ella moss ® reporting unit acquired in 2009 sells premium tops and casual apparel primarily in the women’s contemporary apparel space in recent years the brand has been negatively impacted by challenging consumer trends in women’s contemporary apparel which has led to reduced foot traffic and increased promotional activity in department stores and in our vfoperated stores as a result all goodwill related to the splendid ® and ella moss ® reporting unit was written off as part of the 2014 impairment analysis 1424 million additionally in 2014 management recognized impairment charges related to the splendid ® and ella moss ® trademark and definitelived customer relationship asset of 457 million and 642 million respectively 

in 2015 the splendid ® and ella moss ® reporting unit continued to be challenged by reduced consumer demand for contemporary apparel particularly in the later months of the year which caused brand performance to miss the revenue and profitability projections used in the 2014 impairment analysis management’s revenue and profitability forecasts used in the splendid ® and ella moss ® trademark valuation were developed in conjunction with management’s annual strategic plan review conducted in the fourth quarter our resulting revised outlook for business performance took a more cautious view and considered recent performance and trends strategic initiatives the general softness of the contemporary apparel market and expected further declines in this market key assumptions developed by vf management and used in our quantitative analysis of the splendid ® and ella moss ® trademark include 

 

  

  

 the splendid ® and ella moss ® trademark has a remaining carrying value of 379 million as of december 2015 because actual results for the splendid ® and ella moss ® reporting unit may vary from projected results management performed sensitivity analysis on the trademark impairment valuation noting that a 50 increase in the forecasted cumulative average revenue rate of decline used in the valuation would increase the 2015 trademark impairment charge by approximately 25 million separately a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate would increase the impairment charge by approximately 32 million 

also in 2015 management concluded that a triggering event occurred related to the splendid ® and ella moss ® definitelived customer relationship intangible asset based on the results of the trademark valuation as well as management’s annual strategic plan review conducted in the fourth quarter accordingly management performed a quantitative impairment analysis which utilized the assumptions listed above for the trademark valuation and also considered historical attrition rates revenues and profitability related to wholesale customers that existed at acquisition vf recorded an 117 million impairment charge for the splendid ® and ella moss ® customer relationship asset which has no remaining carrying value as of december 2015 

7 for all mankind ® impairment analysis 

vf performed a fair value assessment of the trademark intangible asset at the 7 for all mankind ® reporting unit as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2015 and recorded a 761 million impairment charge 

  

the 7 for all mankind ® reporting unit acquired in 2007 markets premium denim through wholesale and directtoconsumer channels primarily in north america and europe over the last several years the brand has been negatively impacted by ongoing challenges in the premium denim market as a result all goodwill related to the 7   for all mankind ® reporting unit was written off as part of the 2010 impairment analysis in addition a portion of the original value of the trademark was impaired in 2010 66 million and 2014 876 million as part of the trademark impairment analysis for those years also in 2014 management recorded a 566 million impairment charge related to the 7 for all mankind ® customer relationship asset 

in 2015 the market for premium denim and apparel continued to decline as reduced consumer demand was amplified by a reduction in tourism which negatively impacted revenues at our stores in urban and tourist locations particularly in the later months of the year as a result the brand’s 2015 performance missed the revenue and profitability projections included in the 2014 impairment analysis management’s revenue and profitability forecasts used in the 7 for all mankind ® trademark valuation were developed in conjunction with management’s annual strategic plan review conducted in the fourth quarter our resulting revised outlook for business performance took a more cautious view and considered recent performance and trends strategic initiatives the general softness of the premium denim and apparel market and expected further declines in this market key assumptions developed by vf management and used in our quantitative analysis of the 7 for all mankind ® trademark include 

 

  

  

 the 7 for all mankind ® trademark has a remaining carrying value of 1261 million as of december 2015 because actual results for the 7 for all mankind ® reporting unit may vary from projected results management performed sensitivity analysis on the trademark impairment valuation noting that a 50 decrease in the forecasted cumulative average revenue growth rate used in the valuation would increase the 2015 trademark impairment charge by approximately 46 million separately a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate would increase the impairment charge by approximately 108 million 

also in 2015 management concluded that a triggering event occurred related to the 7 for all mankind ® definitelived customer relationship intangible asset based on the results of the trademark valuation as well as management’s annual strategic plan review conducted in the fourth quarter accordingly management performed a quantitative impairment analysis which utilized the assumptions listed above for the trademark valuation and also considered historical attrition rates revenues and profitability related to wholesale customers that existed at acquisition vf recorded a 405 million impairment charge for the 7 for all mankind ® customer relationship asset which has no remaining carrying value as of december 2015 

other reporting units — qualitative impairment analysis 

for all other reporting units vf elected to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the goodwill and trademark intangible assets in those reporting units were impaired in this qualitative assessment vf considered relevant events and circumstances for each reporting unit including i current year results ii financial performance versus management’s annual and fiveyear strategic plans iii changes in the reporting unit carrying value since prior year iv industry and market conditions in which the reporting unit operates v macroeconomic conditions including discount rate changes and vi changes in products or services offered by the reporting unit if applicable performance in recent years was compared to forecasts included in prior valuations based on the results of the qualitative assessment vf concluded that it was not more likely than not that the carrying values of the goodwill and trademark intangible assets were greater than their fair values and that further quantitative testing was not necessary 

  

management’s use of estimates and assumptions 

it is possible that vf’s conclusions regarding impairment or recoverability of goodwill or intangible assets in any reporting unit could change in future periods there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions used in our goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing performed as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2015 will prove to be accurate predictions of the future if for example i the businesses do not perform as projected ii overall economic conditions in 2016 or future years vary from current assumptions including changes in discount rates iii business conditions or strategies for a specific reporting unit change from current assumptions including loss of major customers iv investors require higher rates of return on equity investments in the marketplace or v enterprise values of comparable publicly traded companies or actual sales transactions of comparable companies were to decline resulting in lower multiples of revenues and ebitda 

a future impairment charge for goodwill or intangible assets could have a material effect on vf’s consolidated financial position and results of operations 

stock options 

vf uses a lattice optionpricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees and nonemployee members of the board of directors vf believes that a lattice model provides a refined estimate of the fair value of options because it can incorporate i historical option exercise patterns and multiple assumptions about future option exercise patterns for each of several groups of option holders and ii inputs that vary over time such as assumptions for interest rates and volatility management performs an annual review of all assumptions employed in the valuation of option grants and believes they are reflective of the outstanding options and underlying common stock and of groups of option participants the lattice valuation incorporates the assumptions listed in note n to the consolidated financial statements 

one of the critical assumptions in the valuation process is estimating the expected average life of the options before they are exercised for each option grant vf estimated the expected average life based on evaluations of the historical and expected option exercise patterns for each of the groups of option holders that have historically exhibited different option exercise patterns these evaluations included i voluntary stock option exercise patterns based on a combination of changes in the price of vf common stock and periods of time that options are outstanding before exercise and ii involuntary exercise patterns resulting from turnover retirement and death 

volatility is another critical assumption requiring judgment management bases its estimates of future volatility on a combination of implied and historical volatility implied volatility is based on shortterm 6 to 9 months publicly traded nearthemoney options on vf common stock vf measures historical volatility over a tenyear period corresponding to the contractual term of the options using daily stock prices management’s assumption for valuation purposes is that expected volatility starts at a level equal to the implied volatility and then transitions to the historical volatility over the remainder of the tenyear option term 

pension obligations 

vf sponsors a qualified defined benefit pension plan covering most fulltime us employees hired before 2005 and an unfunded supplemental defined benefit pension plan that provides benefits in excess of the limitations imposed by income tax regulations vf also sponsors certain nonus defined benefit pension plans the selection of actuarial assumptions for determining the projected pension benefit liabilities and annual pension expense is significant due to amounts involved and the long time period over which benefits are accrued and paid 

management reviews annually the principal economic actuarial assumptions summarized in note l to the consolidated financial statements and revises them as appropriate based on current rates and trends vf also 

  

periodically reviews and revises as necessary other plan assumptions such as rates of compensation increases retirement termination disability and mortality vf believes the assumptions appropriately reflect the participants’ demographics and projected benefit obligations of the plans and result in the best estimate of the plans’ future experience actual results may vary from the actuarial assumptions used 

effective fiscal year 2015 vf earlyadopted fasb asu 201504 practical expedient for measurement date of an employer’s defined benefit obligation and plan assets  this standard permits companies with a noncalendar fiscal yearend to use the calendar month end closest to their fiscal yearend to measure defined benefit plan assets and liabilities therefore all plan assets and liabilities were valued as of december 31 2015 this did not impact our valuation as december 31 2015 was also the last business day of our fiscal year 

the below discussion of discount rate return on assets and mortality assumptions relate specifically to the us pension plans as they comprise approximately 93 of vf’s total defined benefit plan assets and approximately 92 of vf’s total projected benefit obligations of the combined us and international plans 

one of the critical assumptions used in the actuarial model is the discount rate which is used to estimate the present value of future cash outflows necessary to meet projected benefit obligations for the specific plan it is the estimated interest rate that vf could use to settle its projected benefit obligations at the valuation date the discount rate assumption is based on current market interest rates vf selects a discount rate for each of the us pension plans by matching high quality corporate bond yields to the timing of projected benefit payments to participants in each plan vf uses the population of us corporate bonds rated ‘aa’ by moody’s investors service or standard  poor’s ratings services vf excludes the highest and lowest yielding bonds from this population of approximately 688 such bonds having at least 500 million outstanding that are noncallablenonputable unless with makewhole provisions each plan’s projected benefit payments are matched to current market interest rates over the expected payment period to calculate an associated present value a single equivalent discount rate is then determined that produces the same present value the resulting discount rate is reflective of both the current interest rate environment and the plan’s distinct liability characteristics vf believes that those ‘aa’ rated issues meet the “high quality” intent of the applicable accounting standards and that the 2015 discount rates of 445 for the us qualified defined benefit pension plan and 444 for the unfunded supplemental defined benefit plan appropriately reflect current market conditions and the longterm nature of projected benefit payments to participants in the us pension plans these higher discount rates compared with the rates of 405 for the us qualified defined benefit pension plan and 400 for the unfunded supplemental defined benefit plan at the end of 2014 reflect the general increase in yields of us government obligations and high quality corporate bonds during 2015 the discount rate for the plans may differ from the rates used by other companies because of a longer expected duration of benefit payments reflecting i the higher percentage of female participants who generally have a longer life expectancy than males and ii the higher percentage of inactive participants who will not begin receiving vested benefits for many years 

the sec announced in 2015 that it would not object to companies using the spot rate approach a more granular approach to measuring service cost and interest cost vf adopted the spot rate approach at yearend 2015 previously the same single equivalent discount rate determined for measuring the projected benefit obligation was also used to determine service cost and interest cost under the new spot rate approach the full yield curve is applied separately to cash flows for each projected benefit obligation service cost and interest cost for a more precise calculation the change to the spot rate approach on the yearend 2015 projected benefit obligation valuation had an immaterial impact however the new approach impacts 2016 pension expense by lowering service cost and interest cost by approximately 135 million vf expects that the spot rate approach will continue to lower service and interest cost in the next several years 

another critical assumption of the actuarial model is the expected longterm rate of return on investments vf’s investment objective is to invest in a diversified portfolio of assets with an acceptable level of risk to maximize the longterm return while minimizing volatility in the value of plan assets relative to the value of plan 

  

liabilities these risks include market interest rate credit liquidity regulatory and foreign securities risks investment assets consist of us and international equity corporate and governmental fixedincome securities insurance contracts and alternative assets vf develops a projected rate of return for each of the investment asset classes based on many factors including historical and expected returns the estimated inflation rate the premium to be earned in excess of a riskfree return the premium for equity risk and the premium for longer duration fixedincome securities the weighted average projected longterm rates of return of the various assets held by the qualified plan provide the basis for the expected longterm rate of return actuarial assumption vf’s rate of return assumption was 625 in 2015 650 in 2014 and 700 in 2013 in recent years vf has altered the investment mix by i increasing the allocation to fixedincome investments and reducing the allocation to equity investments ii increasing the allocation in equities to more international investments and iii adding alternative assets as an asset class the changes in asset allocation are anticipated over time to reduce the yeartoyear variability of the us plan’s funded status and resulting pension expense management monitors the plan’s asset allocation to balance risk with anticipated investment returns in a given year based on an evaluation of market conditions and projected market returns vf will be using a rate of return assumption of 600 for the us plan for 2016 

we consistently review all of our demographic assumptions as part of the normal management of our defined benefit plans and update these assumptions as appropriate in 2014 the society of actuaries soa issued new mortality tables rp2014 and mortality improvement scales mp2014 which reflect longer life expectancies than the previous tables this updated information was considered along with the characteristics of our planspecific populations and other data where appropriate in developing our best estimate of the expected mortality rates of plan participants in the us pension plans in 2015 the soa issued mp2015 an updated scale based on the same underlying soa rp2014 study that reflects two additional years of mortality experience vf considered the newly released mp2015 and determined it is directionally consistent with the assumptions adopted by vf in 2014 

differences between actual results in a given year and the actuarially determined assumed results for that year eg investment performance discount rates and other assumptions do not affect that year’s pension expense but instead are deferred as unrecognized actuarial gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheet at the end of 2015 there were 5868 million of pretax accumulated deferred actuarial losses plus 175 million of pretax deferred prior service costs resulting in an after tax amount of 3722 million in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the 2015 consolidated balance sheet these deferred losses will be amortized as a component of pension expense 

pension expense recognized in the financial statements was 648 million in 2015 579 million in 2014 and 895 million in 2013 this compares with the cost of pension benefits actually earned each year by covered active employees commonly called “service cost” of 292 million in 2015 242 million in 2014 and 254 million in 2013 pension expense has been significantly higher than the annual service cost in recent years due to the amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses as discussed in the preceding paragraph looking forward vf expects 2016 pension expense to decrease to approximately 618 million which reflects a reduction in expense related to application of the spot rate approach partially offset by an increase in amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses 

  

the sensitivity of changes in actuarial assumptions on 2015 pension expense and on projected benefit obligations related to the us defined benefit pension plan at the end of 2015 all other factors being equal is illustrated by the following 

 

 as discussed in the “risk management” section above vf has taken several steps to reduce volatility in the pension plans and their impact on the financial statements on a longerterm basis vf believes the yeartoyear variability of the retirement benefit expense should decrease 

income taxes 

as a global company vf is subject to income taxes and files income tax returns in over 100 us and foreign jurisdictions each year almost every jurisdiction in which vf operates has a lower effective income tax rate than the us as discussed in note o to the consolidated financial statements vf has been granted a lower effective income tax rate on taxable earnings in certain foreign jurisdictions due to economic and political conditions tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change the company could be subject to changes in its tax rates the adoption of new us or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities vf makes an ongoing assessment to identify any significant exposure related to increases in tax rates in international jurisdictions 

in february 2015 the european union commission “eu” opened a state aid investigation into rulings granted to companies under belgium’s excess profit tax regime on january 11 2016 the eu announced its decision that these rulings were illegal and ordered that tax benefits granted under these rulings should be collected from the affected companies including vf if this matter is adversely resolved the belgian government may be required to assess and vf may be required to pay past taxes reflective of the disallowed alleged state aid that vf received in years 2010 through 2014 vf is currently assessing its legal options and the impact that an adverse outcome would have on the company’s financial statements in future periods but does not expect the impact to be material 

the calculation of income tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations which are subject to legal interpretation and significant management judgment vf’s income tax returns are regularly examined by federal state and foreign tax authorities and those audits may result in proposed adjustments vf has reviewed all issues raised upon examination as well as any exposure for issues that may be raised in future examinations vf has evaluated these potential issues under the “morelikelythannot” standard of the accounting literature a tax position is recognized if it meets this standard and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized such judgments and estimates may change based on audit settlements court cases and interpretation of tax laws and regulations income tax expense could be materially affected to the extent vf prevails in a tax position or when the statute of limitations expires for a tax position for which a liability for unrecognized tax benefits or valuation allowances has been established or to the extent vf is required to pay amounts greater than the established liability for unrecognized tax benefits vf does not currently anticipate any material impact on earnings from the ultimate resolution of income tax uncertainties there are no accruals for general or unknown tax expenses 

  

vf has 1396 million of gross deferred income tax assets related to operating loss and capital loss carryforwards and 954 million of valuation allowances against those assets realization of deferred tax assets related to operating loss and capital loss carryforwards is dependent on future taxable income in specific jurisdictions the amount and timing of which are uncertain and on possible changes in tax laws if management believes that vf will not be able to generate sufficient taxable income or capital gains to offset losses during the carryforward periods vf records valuation allowances to reduce those deferred tax assets to amounts expected to be ultimately realized if in a future period management determines that the amount of deferred tax assets to be realized differs from the net recorded amount vf would record an adjustment to income tax expense in that future period 

vf has not provided us income taxes on a portion of the foreign subsidiaries’ undistributed earnings because these earnings are permanently reinvested in the respective foreign jurisdictions vf has not determined the deferred tax liabilities associated with these undistributed earnings as such determination is not practicable if vf decided to remit those earnings to the us in a future period the provision for income taxes could increase in that period

approximately 70 of image revenues are from industrial laundries resellers and distributors that in turn supply customized workwear to employers for production service and whitecollar personnel since industrial laundries and distributors maintain minimal inventories of work clothes vf’s ability to offer rapid delivery of products in a broad range of sizes is an important advantage in this market our commitment to customer service supported by an automated central distribution center with several satellite locations enables customer orders to be filled within 24 hours of receipt as a result the red kap ® and bulwark ® brands have a strong presence in the reseller distributor market and are growing in the workwear retail market

our fullprice stores allow us to display a brand’s full line of products with fixtures and imagery that support the brand’s positioning and promise to consumers these experiences provide high visibility for our brands and products and enable us to stay close to the needs and preferences of our consumers the complete and impactful presentation of products in our stores also helps to increase sellthrough of vf products at our wholesale customers due to increased brand awareness education and visibility vfoperated fullprice stores generally provide gross margins that are well above vf averages 

  

in addition vf operates outlet stores in both premium outlet malls and more traditional valuebased locations these outlet stores serve an important role in our overall inventory management and profitability by allowing vf to sell a significant portion of excess discontinued and outofseason products at better prices than are otherwise available from outside parties while maintaining the integrity of our brands

licensing arrangements 

as part of our strategy of expanding market penetration of vfowned brands we enter into licensing agreements with independent parties for specific apparel and complementary product categories when such arrangements provide more effective manufacturing distribution and marketing than could be achieved internally we provide support to these business partners and ensure the integrity of our brand names by taking an active role in the design quality control advertising marketing and distribution of licensed products 

licensing arrangements relate to a broad range of vf brands license agreements are for fixed terms of generally three to five years with conditional renewal options each licensee pays royalties to vf based on its sales of licensed products with most agreements providing for a minimum royalty requirement royalties generally range from 4 to 10 of the licensing partners’ net licensed products sales royalty income was 1274 million in 2014 1 of total revenues primarily from the nautica ®  vans ®  lee ®  timberland ®  and wrangler ® brands in addition licensees of our brands are generally required to spend from 1 to 5 of their net licensed product sales to advertise vf’s products in some cases these advertising amounts are remitted to vf for advertising on behalf of the licensees

manufacturing sourcing and distribution 

product design and innovation including fit fabric finish and quality are important elements across our businesses these functions are performed by employees located in our global supply chain organization and our branded business units across the globe 

vf’s centralized global supply chain organization is responsible for sourcing and delivering products to our customers vf is highly skilled in managing the complexities associated with our global supply chain on an annual basis vf sources or produces approximately 522 million units spread across more than 30 brands our products are obtained from 28 vfoperated manufacturing facilities and approximately 2000 contractor manufacturing facilities in over 50 countries additionally we operate 32 distribution centers and 1401 retail stores managing this complexity is made possible by the use of a network of information systems for product development forecasting order management and warehouse management along with our core enterprise resource management platforms 

in 2014 24 of our units were manufactured in vfowned facilities and 76 were obtained from independent contractors primarily in asia products manufactured in vf facilities generally have a lower cost and shorter lead times than products procured from independent contractors products obtained from contractors in the western hemisphere generally have a higher cost than products obtained from contractors in asia however contracting in the western hemisphere gives us greater flexibility shorter lead times and allows for lower inventory levels this combination of vfowned and contracted production along with different geographic regions and cost structures provides a wellbalanced flexible approach to product sourcing we will continue to manage our supply chain from a global perspective and adjust as needed to changes in the global production environment 

vf operates manufacturing facilities in the us mexico central and south america the caribbean europe and the middle east a significant percentage of denim bottoms and occupational apparel is manufactured in these plants as well as a smaller percentage of footwear for these owned production facilities we purchase raw materials from numerous domestic and international suppliers to meet our production needs raw materials include products made from cotton leather rubber wool synthetics and blends of cotton and synthetic yarn as well as thread and trim product identification buttons zippers snaps eyelets and laces in some instances we contract the sewing of vfowned raw materials into finished product with independent contractors manufacturing in the us includes all major league baseball uniforms along with screen printing and embroidery of jerseys tshirts and fleece products fixed price commitments for fabric and certain supplies are generally set on a quarterly basis for the next quarter’s purchases no single supplier represents more than 5 of our total cost of sales 

independent contractors generally own the raw materials and ship finished readyforsale products to vf these contractors are engaged through vf sourcing hubs in hong kong with satellite offices across asia and panama these hubs are responsible for coordinating the manufacturing and procurement of product supplier management product quality assurance and transportation and shipping functions in the eastern and western hemispheres respectively substantially all products in the outdoor  action sports and sportswear coalitions as well as a portion of products for our jeanswear and imagewear coalitions are obtained through these sourcing hubs for most products in our contemporary brands coalition we contract the sewing and finishing of vfowned raw materials through a network of independent contractors based in the us 

management continually monitors political risks and developments related to duties tariffs and quotas we limit vf’s sourcing exposure through among other measures i diversifying geographies with a mix of vfoperated and contracted production ii shifting of production among countries and contractors iii sourcing production to merchandise categories where product is readily available and iv sourcing from countries with tariff preference and free trade agreements vf does not directly or indirectly source products from suppliers in countries that are prohibited by the state department 

all vfoperated production facilities throughout the world as well as all independent contractor facilities that manufacture vf products must comply with vf’s global compliance principles these principles 

  

established in 1997 and consistent with international labor standards are a set of strict standards covering legal and ethical business practices workers’ ages work hours health and safety conditions environmental standards and compliance with local laws and regulations in addition our owned factories must also undergo certification by the independent nonprofit organization worldwide responsible accredited production “wrap” which promotes global ethics in manufacturing 

vf through its contractor monitoring program audits the activities of the independent businesses and contractors that produce vf products at locations across the globe each of the approximately 2000 independent contractor facilities including those serving our independent licensees must be precertified before producing vf products this precertification includes passing a factory inspection and signing a vf terms of engagement agreement we maintain an ongoing audit program to ensure compliance with these requirements by using dedicated internal staff and externally contracted firms additional information about vf’s code of business conduct global compliance principles terms of engagement factory compliance guidelines factory audit procedure and environmental compliance guidelines along with a global compliance report is available on the vf website at wwwvfccom 

vf did not experience difficulty in fulfilling its raw material and contracting production needs during 2014 absent any material changes vf believes it would be able to largely offset any increases in product costs through i the continuing shift in the mix of its business to higher margin brands geographies and channels of distribution ii increases in the prices of its products and iii cost reduction opportunities the loss of any one supplier or contractor would not have a significant adverse effect on our business 

product is shipped from our independent suppliers and vfoperated manufacturing facilities to distribution centers around the world in some instances product is shipped directly to our customers most distribution centers are operated by vf and some support more than one brand a portion of our distribution needs are met by contract distribution centers 

seasonality 

vf’s quarterly operating results vary due to the seasonality of our individual businesses and are historically stronger in the second half of the year on a quarterly basis in 2014 consolidated revenues ranged from a low of 20 of full year revenues in the second quarter to a high of 29 in both the third and fourth quarters while consolidated operating margin ranged from a low of 9 in the second quarter to a high of 18 in the third quarter this variation results primarily from the seasonal influences on revenues of our outdoor  action sports coalition where 18 of the coalition’s revenues occurred in the second quarter compared to 30 in both the third and fourth quarters of 2014 with changes in our mix of business and the growth of our retail operations historical quarterly revenue and profit trends may not be indicative of future trends 

working capital requirements vary throughout the year working capital increases during the first half of the year as inventory builds to support peak shipping periods and then moderates during the second half of the year as those inventories are sold and accounts receivable are collected cash provided by operating activities is substantially higher in the second half of the year due to higher net income during that period and reduced working capital requirements particularly during the fourth quarter 

advertising customer support and community outreach 

during 2014 our advertising and promotion expense was 7137 million representing 58 of total revenues we advertise in consumer and trade publications on radio and television and through digital initiatives including social media and mobile platforms on the internet we also participate in cooperative advertising on a shared cost basis with major retailers in print media radio and television we sponsor sporting musical and special events as well as athletes and personalities who promote our products we employ marketing sciences to optimize the impact of advertising and promotional spending and to identify the types of spending that provide the greatest return on our marketing investments 

  

we provide advertising support to our wholesale customers in the form of pointofsale fixtures and signage to enhance the presentation and brand image of our products we also participate in shopinshops and concession retail arrangements which are separate sales areas dedicated to a specific vf brand within our customers’ stores to help differentiate and enhance the presentation of our products 

we contribute to incentive programs with our wholesale customers including cooperative advertising funds discounts and allowances we also offer sales incentive programs directly to consumers in the form of rebate and coupon offers 

in addition to sponsorships and activities that directly benefit our products and brands vf and its associates actively support our communities and various charities for example the north face ® brand has committed to programs that encourage and enable outdoor participation such as the planet explore ®  the the north face endurance challenge ® and the explore your parks ™ programs the timberland ® brand has a strong heritage of volunteerism including the path of service ™ program that offers fulltime employees up to 40 hours of paid time off a year to serve their local communities through global service events such as earth day in the spring and servapalooza in the fall the wrangler ® brand launched the tough enough to wear pink ™ program which honors and raises money for breast cancer survivors and the national patriot program ™  which funds agencies that serve wounded and fallen american military veterans and their families over the past 3 years the vans ® brand has hosted annual vans ® earth day and vans ® gives back day events in which all employees at brand headquarters spend the day volunteering in the community the nautica ® brand supports oceana a notforprofit organization focused on ocean conservatism and charitywater a notforprofit organization focused on providing clean safe water to people in need in addition 2014 marked the nineteenth year of support for the lee national denim day ® event one of the country’s largest singleday fundraisers for breast cancer that has raised over 91 million since its inception to fight breast cancer vf sponsors the “vf 100” program to honor the 100 vf associates worldwide having the highest number of volunteer service hours during the year 

sustainability 

vf’s approach to sustainability and responsibility “sr” is to responsibly manage its business from the way it makes distributes and markets products to the ways it preserves the environment and supports local communities during 2014 vf continued to build a global sustainability infrastructure to support the goals of sr this included the launch of a global sr scorecard to enable data collection and goalsetting and an assessment to identify our sustainability risks and opportunities vf also launched its inaugural sr report a compilation of the many actions and investments taking place across vf for our businesses to operate in a sustainable manner current initiatives include i an ongoing partnership with the better cotton initiative to promote sustainable farming methods ii retrofitting owned facilities with led lighting and pursuing leed leadership in energy and environmental design or breeam building research establishment environmental assessment methodology certification for new offices and distribution centers and iii continuing our innovative approach to responsible chemical management in our supply chain 

other matters

intellectual property 

trademarks trade names patents and domain names as well as related logos designs and graphics provide substantial value in the development and marketing of vf’s products and are important to our continued success we have registered this intellectual property in the us and in other countries where our products are manufactured andor sold we vigorously monitor and enforce vf’s intellectual property against counterfeiting infringement and violations of other rights where and to the extent legal feasible and appropriate in addition we grant licenses to other parties to manufacture and sell products utilizing our intellectual property in product categories and geographic areas in which vf does not operate

sales to vf’s ten largest customers all of which are retailers based in the us amounted to 20 of total revenues in 2014 and 21 in both 2013 and 2012 sales to the five largest customers amounted to approximately 15 of total revenues in 2014 and 16 in both 2013 and 2012 sales to vf’s largest customer totaled 8 of total revenues in 2014 2013 and 2012 the majority of which were in the jeanswear coalition 

employees

 item 1a risk factors  

the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating vf’s business and the forwardlooking statements contained in this form 10k any of the following risks could materially adversely affect vf’s business its operating results and its financial condition 

vf’s revenues and profits depend on the level of consumer spending for apparel which is sensitive to general economic conditions and other factors a return to recessionary conditions or a decline in consumer spending could have a material adverse effect on vf 

the apparel industry has historically been subject to cyclical variations and is particularly affected by adverse trends in the general economy the success of vf’s business depends on consumer spending and there are a number of factors that influence consumer spending including actual and perceived economic conditions 

  

disposable consumer income interest rates consumer credit availability unemployment stock market performance extreme weather conditions energy prices and tax rates in the international national regional and local markets where vf’s products are sold a decline in actual or perceived economic conditions or other factors could negatively impact the level of consumer spending and have a material adverse impact on vf 

the apparel and footwear industries are highly competitive and vf’s success depends on its ability to respond to constantly changing markets 

vf competes with numerous apparel and footwear brands and manufacturers competition is generally based upon brand name recognition price design product quality selection service and purchasing convenience some of our competitors are larger and have more resources than vf in some product categories and regions in addition vf competes directly with the private label brands of its wholesale customers vf’s ability to compete within the apparel and footwear industries depends on our ability to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 failure to compete effectively or to keep pace with rapidly changing markets and trends could have a material adverse effect on vf’s business financial condition and results of operations 

vf’s results of operations could be materially harmed if we are unable to gauge consumer preferences and product trends and accurately forecast demand for our products 

our success depends in part on management’s ability to effectively anticipate and respond to changing consumer preferences and product trends and to translate trends into marketable product offerings in advance of the actual time of sale to the customer even if we are successful in anticipating consumer demands we must continue to be able to develop and introduce innovative highquality products in order to sustain consumer demand 

we often schedule internal production and place orders for products with independent manufacturers before our customers’ orders are firm factors that could affect our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products include 

 

  

  

  

  

   

there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully anticipate changing consumer preferences and product trends or economic conditions and as a result we may not successfully manage inventory levels to meet our future order requirements if we fail to accurately forecast consumer demand we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of product required to meet the demand inventory levels in excess of consumer demand may result in inventory writedowns and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices which could have an adverse effect on the image and reputation of vf’s brands and negatively impact profitability on the other hand if we underestimate demand for our products our manufacturing facilities or thirdparty manufacturers may not be able to produce products to meet consumer requirements and this could result in delays in the shipment of products and lost revenues as well as damage to vf’s reputation and relationships these risks could have a material adverse effect on our brand image as well as our results of operations and financial condition 

vf’s business and the success of its products could be harmed if vf is unable to maintain the images of its brands 

vf’s success to date has been due in large part to the growth of its brands’ images and vf’s customers’ connection to its brands if we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to changing consumer demand the names and images of our brands may be impaired even if we react appropriately to changes in consumer preferences consumers may consider our brands’ images to be outdated or associate our brands with styles that are no longer popular in addition brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of qualities including merchandise quality and corporate integrity negative claims or publicity regarding vf its brands or its products including licensed products could adversely affect our reputation and sales regardless of whether such claims are accurate social media which accelerates the dissemination of information can increase the challenges of responding to negative claims in the past many apparel companies have experienced periods of rapid growth in sales and earnings followed by periods of declining sales and losses our businesses may be similarly affected in the future in addition we have sponsorship contracts with a number of athletes and musicians and feature those individuals in our advertising and marketing efforts actions taken by those individuals associated with our products could harm their reputations and adversely affect the images of our brands 

vf’s revenues and cash requirements are affected by the seasonal nature of its business 

vf’s business is increasingly seasonal with a higher proportion of revenues and operating cash flows generated during the second half of the fiscal year which includes the fall and holiday selling seasons poor sales in the second half of the fiscal year would have a material adverse effect on vf’s full year operating results and cause higher inventories in addition fluctuations in sales and operating income in any fiscal quarter are affected by the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales 

vf’s profitability may decline as a result of increasing pressure on margins 

the apparel industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors including intense competition consolidation in the retail industry pressure from retailers to reduce the costs of products and changes in consumer demand if these factors cause us to reduce our sales prices to retailers and consumers and we fail to sufficiently reduce our product costs or operating expenses vf’s profitability will decline this could have a material adverse effect on vf’s results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

vf may not succeed in its growth strategy 

one of vf’s key strategic objectives is growth we seek to grow organically and through acquisitions we seek to grow by building new lifestyle brands expanding our share with winning customers stretching vf’s brands to new regions managing costs leveraging our supply chain and information technology capabilities 

  

across vf and expanding our directtoconsumer business including opening new stores and remodeling and expanding our existing stores we may not be able to grow our existing businesses we may have difficulty completing acquisitions and we may not be able to successfully integrate a newly acquired business or achieve the expected growth cost savings or synergies from such integration we may not be able to expand our market share with winning customers expand our brands geographically or achieve the expected results from our supply chain initiatives we may have difficulty recruiting developing or retaining qualified employees we may not be able to achieve our store expansion goals manage our growth effectively successfully integrate the planned new stores into our operations or operate our new remodeled and expanded stores profitably failure to implement our growth strategy may have a material adverse effect on vf’s business 

vf relies significantly on information technology any inadequacy interruption integration failure or security failure of this technology could harm vf’s ability to effectively operate its business 

our ability to effectively manage and operate our business depends significantly on information technology systems we rely heavily on information technology to track sales and inventory and manage our supply chain we are also dependent on information technology including the internet for our directtoconsumer sales including our ecommerce operations and retail business credit card transaction authorization despite our preventative efforts our systems and those of our thirdparty service providers may be vulnerable to damage or interruption the failure of these systems to operate effectively problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems difficulty in integrating new systems or systems of acquired businesses or a breach in security of these systems could adversely impact the operations of vf’s business including effective management of inventory inefficient ordering and replenishment of products ecommerce operations retail business credit card transaction authorization and processing corporate email communications and our interaction with the public on social media 

vf is subject to data security and privacy risks that could negatively affect its results operations or reputation 

in the normal course of business we often collect retain and transmit certain sensitive and confidential customer information including credit card information over public networks there is a significant concern by consumers and employees over the security of personal information transmitted over the internet identity theft and user privacy despite the security measures we currently have in place our facilities and systems and those of our thirdparty service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches and vf and its customers could suffer harm if customer information were accessed by third parties due to a security failure in vf’s systems or one of our thirdparty service providers it could require significant expenditures to remediate any such failure or breach severely damage our reputation and our relationships with customers and expose us to risks of litigation and liability in addition as a result of recent security breaches at a number of prominent retailers the media and public scrutiny of information security and privacy has become more intense and the regulatory environment has become more uncertain as a result we may incur significant costs to comply with laws regarding the protection and unauthorized disclosure of personal information 

vf’s business is exposed to the risks of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations vf’s hedging strategies may not be effective in mitigating those risks 

a growing percentage of vf’s total revenues approximately 38 in 2014 is derived from markets outside the us vf’s international businesses operate in functional currencies other than the us dollar changes in currency exchange rates may affect the us dollar value of the foreign currencydenominated amounts at which vf’s international businesses purchase products incur costs or sell products in addition for vf’s usbased businesses the majority of products are sourced from independent contractors or vf plants located in foreign countries as a result the cost of these products may be affected by changes in the value of the relevant currencies furthermore much of vf’s licensing revenue is derived from sales in foreign currencies changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse impact on vf’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

in accordance with our operating practices we hedge a significant portion of our foreign currency transaction exposures arising in the ordinary course of business to reduce risks in our cash flows and earnings our hedging strategy may not be effective in reducing all risks and no hedging strategy can completely insulate vf from foreign exchange risk we do not hedge foreign currency translation rate changes 

further our use of derivative financial instruments may expose vf to counterparty risks although vf only enters into hedging contracts with counterparties having investment grade credit ratings it is possible that the credit quality of a counterparty could be downgraded or a counterparty could default on its obligations which could have a material adverse impact on vf’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

there are risks associated with vf’s acquisitions 

any acquisitions or mergers by vf will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of companies these risks include among other things higher than anticipated acquisition costs and expenses the difficulty and expense of integrating the operations systems and personnel of the companies and the loss of key employees and customers as a result of changes in management in addition geographic distances may make integration of acquired businesses more difficult we may not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with any acquisitions 

our acquisitions may cause large onetime expenses or create goodwill or other intangible assets that could result in significant impairment charges in the future we also make certain estimates and assumptions in order to determine purchase price allocation and estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed if our estimates or assumptions used to value these assets and liabilities are not accurate we may be exposed to losses that may be material 

vf’s operations in international markets and earnings in those markets may be affected by legal regulatory political and economic risks 

our ability to maintain the current level of operations in our existing international markets and to capitalize on growth in existing and new international markets is subject to risks associated with international operations these include the burdens of complying with foreign laws and regulations unexpected changes in regulatory requirements tariffs or other barriers in some international markets 

we cannot predict whether quotas duties taxes exchange controls or other restrictions will be imposed by the us the european union or other countries on the import or export of our products or what effect any of these actions would have on vf’s business financial condition or results of operations we cannot predict whether there might be changes in our ability to repatriate earnings or capital from international jurisdictions changes in regulatory geopolitical policies and other factors may adversely affect vf’s business or may require us to modify our current business practices 

a significant portion of vf’s 2014 net income was earned in jurisdictions outside the us vf is exposed to risks of changes in us policy for companies having business operations outside the us there have been a number of proposed changes to us income tax laws including overall corporate and individual tax reform some of these tax law changes and tax reform proposals among other things consider accelerating the us taxability of nonus earnings or limiting foreign tax credits while enactment of any such proposal is not certain if new legislation were enacted it is possible our us income tax expense could increase which would reduce our earnings 

we may have additional tax liabilities 

as a global company we determine our income tax liability in various tax jurisdictions based on an analysis and interpretation of local tax laws and regulations this analysis requires a significant amount of judgment and 

  

estimation and is often based on various assumptions about the future actions of the local tax authorities these determinations are the subject of periodic domestic and foreign tax audits although we accrue for uncertain tax positions our accrual may be insufficient to satisfy unfavorable findings unfavorable audit findings and tax rulings may result in payment of taxes fines and penalties for prior periods and higher tax rates in future periods which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows further in an effort to deal with budget deficits governments around the world are focusing on increasing tax revenues through increased audits and potentially increased tax rates for corporations changes in tax law or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly affect the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements and could significantly impact our profitability 

vf’s balance sheet includes a significant amount of intangible assets and goodwill a decline in the fair value of an intangible asset or of a business unit could result in an asset impairment charge which would be recorded as an operating expense in vf’s consolidated statement of income and could be material 

we evaluate goodwill and indefinitelived trademark and trade name intangible assets for possible impairment at least annually in addition intangible assets that are being amortized are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value might not be recoverable for these impairment tests we use various valuation methods to estimate the fair value of our business units and intangible assets if the fair value of an asset is less than its carrying value we would recognize an impairment charge for the difference 

it is possible that we could have an impairment charge for goodwill or trademark and trade name intangible assets in future periods if i overall economic conditions in 2015 or future years vary from our current assumptions ii business conditions or our strategies for a specific business unit change from our current assumptions iii investors require higher rates of return on equity investments in the marketplace or iv enterprise values of comparable publicly traded companies or of actual sales transactions of comparable companies were to decline resulting in lower comparable multiples of revenues and earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” and accordingly lower implied values of goodwill and intangible assets a future impairment charge for goodwill or intangible assets could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

vf uses thirdparty suppliers and manufacturing facilities worldwide for a substantial portion of its raw materials and finished products which poses risks to vf’s business operations 

during fiscal 2014 approximately 76 of vf’s units were purchased from independent manufacturers primarily located in asia with substantially all of the remainder produced by vfowned and operated manufacturing facilities located in the us mexico central and south america the caribbean europe and the middle east any of the following could impact our ability to produce or deliver vf products 

 

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

 although no single supplier and no one country is critical to vf’s production needs if we were to lose a supplier it could result in interruption of finished goods shipments to vf cancellation of orders by customers and termination of relationships this along with the damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on vf’s revenues and consequently our results of operations 

our business is subject to national state and local laws and regulations for environmental employment safety and other matters the costs of compliance with or the violation of such laws and regulations by vf or by independent suppliers who manufacture products for vf could have an adverse effect on our operations and cash flows as well as on our reputation 

our business is subject to comprehensive federal state and local laws and regulations on a wide range of environmental employment safety and other matters vf could be adversely affected by costs of compliance with or violations of those laws and regulations in addition while we do not control their business practices we require thirdparty suppliers to operate in compliance with applicable laws rules and regulations regarding working conditions employment practices and environmental compliance the costs of products purchased by vf from independent contractors could increase due to the costs of compliance by those contractors 

failure by vf or its thirdparty suppliers to comply with such laws and regulations as well as with ethical social product labor and environmental standards or related political considerations could result in interruption of finished goods shipments to vf cancellation of orders by customers and termination of relationships if one of our independent contractors violates labor or other laws or implements labor or other business practices that are generally regarded as unethical it could jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions including boycotts that may reduce demand for vf’s merchandise damage to vf’s reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on vf’s results of operations financial condition and cash flows as well as require additional resources to rebuild vf’s reputation 

fluctuations in wage rates and the price availability and quality of raw materials and finished goods could increase costs 

fluctuations in the price availability and quality of fabrics leather or other raw materials used by vf in its manufactured products or of purchased finished goods could have a material adverse effect on vf’s cost of sales or its ability to meet its customers’ demands the prices we pay depend on demand and market prices for the raw materials used to produce them the price and availability of such raw materials may fluctuate significantly depending on many factors including general economic conditions and demand crop yields energy prices weather patterns and speculation in the commodities markets prices of purchased finished products also depend on wage rates in asia and other geographic areas where our independent contractors are located as well as freight costs from those regions in addition fluctuations in wage rates required by legal or industry standards could increase our costs in the future vf may not be able to offset cost increases with other cost reductions or efficiencies or to pass higher costs on to its customers this could have a material adverse effect on vf’s results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

  

we may be adversely affected by weather conditions 

our business is adversely affected by unseasonable weather conditions a significant portion of the sales of our products is dependent in part on the weather and is likely to decline in years in which weather conditions do not favor the use of these products periods of unseasonably warm weather in the fall or winter may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows inventory accumulation by our wholesale customers resulting from unseasonable weather in one season generally negatively affects orders in future seasons which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows abnormally harsh or inclement weather can also negatively impact retail traffic and consumer spending 

a substantial portion of vf’s revenues and gross profit is derived from a small number of large customers the loss of any of these customers or the inability of any of these customers to pay vf could substantially reduce vf’s revenues and profits 

a few of vf’s customers account for a significant portion of revenues sales to vf’s ten largest customers were 20 of total revenues in fiscal 2014 with our largest customer accounting for 8 of revenues sales to our customers are generally on a purchase order basis and not subject to longterm agreements a decision by any of vf’s major customers to significantly decrease the volume of products purchased from vf could substantially reduce revenues and have a material adverse effect on vf’s financial condition and results of operations moreover in recent years the retail industry has experienced consolidation and other ownership changes in the future retailers may further consolidate undergo restructurings or reorganizations realign their affiliations or reposition their stores’ target markets these developments could result in a reduction in the number of stores that carry vf’s products an increase in ownership concentration within the retail industry an increase in credit exposure to vf or an increase in leverage by vf’s customers over their suppliers these changes could impact vf’s opportunities in the market and increase vf’s reliance on a smaller number of large customers 

further the global economy periodically experiences recessionary conditions with rising unemployment reduced availability of credit increased savings rates and declines in real estate and securities values these recessionary conditions could have a negative impact on retail sales of apparel and other consumer products the lower sales volumes along with the possibility of restrictions on access to the credit markets could result in our customers experiencing financial difficulties including store closures bankruptcies or liquidations this could result in higher credit risk to vf relating to receivables from our customers who are experiencing these financial difficulties if these developments occur our inability to shift sales to other customers or to collect on vf’s trade accounts receivable could have a material adverse effect on vf’s financial condition and results of operations 

our ability to obtain short or longterm financing on favorable terms if needed could be adversely affected by geopolitical risk and volatility in the capital markets 

any disruption in the capital markets could limit the availability of funds or the ability or willingness of financial institutions to extend capital in the future this could adversely affect our liquidity and funding resources or significantly increase our cost of capital an inability to access capital and credit markets may have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

vf has a global revolving credit facility one or more of the participating banks may not be able to honor their commitments which could have an adverse effect on vf’s business 

vf has a 125 billion global revolving credit facility that expires in december 2016 if the financial markets return to recessionary conditions this could impair the ability of one or more of the banks participating in our credit agreements from honoring their commitments this could have an adverse effect on our business if we were not able to replace those commitments or to locate other sources of liquidity on acceptable terms 

  

the loss of members of vf’s executive management and other key employees could have a material adverse effect on its business 

vf depends on the services and management experience of its executive officers and business leaders who have substantial experience and expertise in vf’s business vf also depends on other key employees involved in the operation of its business competition for experienced and wellqualified personnel is intense the unexpected loss of services of one or more of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on vf 

vf’s directtoconsumer business includes risks that could have an adverse effect on its results 

vf sells merchandise directtoconsumer through vfoperated stores and ecommerce sites its directtoconsumer business is subject to numerous risks that could have a material adverse effect on its results risks include but are not limited to a domestic or international resellers purchasing merchandise and reselling it overseas outside vf’s control b failure of the systems that operate the stores and websites and their related support systems including computer viruses theft of customer information privacy concerns telecommunication failures and electronic breakins and similar disruptions c credit card fraud and d risks related to vf’s directtoconsumer distribution centers risks specific to vf’s ecommerce business also include a diversion of sales from vf stores or wholesale customers b difficulty in recreating the instore experience through direct channels and c liability for online content vf’s failure to successfully respond to these risks might adversely affect sales in its ecommerce business as well as damage its reputation and brands 

our vfoperated stores and ecommerce business require substantial fixed investments in equipment and leasehold improvements information systems inventory and personnel we have entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space due to the high fixedcost structure associated with our directtoconsumer operations a decline in sales or the closure of or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs writeoffs of equipment and leasehold improvements and employeerelated costs 

vf’s net sales depend on the volume of traffic to its stores and the availability of suitable lease space 

a growing portion of our revenues are directtoconsumer sales through vfoperated stores in order to generate customer traffic we locate many of our stores in prominent locations within successful retail shopping centers or in fashionable shopping districts our stores benefit from the ability of the retail center and other attractions in an area to generate consumer traffic in the vicinity of our stores part of our future growth is significantly dependent on our ability to operate stores in desirable locations with capital investment and lease costs providing the opportunity to earn a reasonable return we cannot control the development of new shopping centers or districts the availability or cost of appropriate locations within existing or new shopping centers or districts competition with other retailers for prominent locations or the success of individual shopping centers or districts further if we are unable to renew or replace our existing store leases or enter into leases for new stores on favorable terms or if we violate the terms of our current leases our growth and profitability could be harmed all of these factors may impact our ability to meet our growth targets and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

vf may be unable to protect its trademarks and other intellectual property rights 

vf’s trademarks and other intellectual property rights are important to its success and its competitive position vf is susceptible to others copying its products and infringing its intellectual property rights especially with the shift in product mix to higher priced brands and innovative new products in recent years some of vf’s brands such as the north face ®  timberland ®  vans ®  jansport ®  nautica ®  wrangler ® and lee ®  enjoy significant worldwide consumer recognition and the higher pricing of those products creates additional risk of counterfeiting and infringement 

vf’s trademarks trade names patents trade secrets and other intellectual property are important to vf’s success counterfeiting of vf’s products or infringement on its intellectual property rights could diminish the 

  

value of our brands and adversely affect vf’s revenues actions we have taken to establish and protect vf’s intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent copying of its products by others or to prevent others from seeking to invalidate its trademarks or block sales of vf’s products as a violation of the trademarks and intellectual property rights of others in addition unilateral actions in the us or other countries including changes to or the repeal of laws recognizing trademark or other intellectual property rights could have an impact on vf’s ability to enforce those rights 

the value of vf’s intellectual property could diminish if others assert rights in or ownership of trademarks and other intellectual property rights of vf or trademarks that are similar to vf’s trademarks or trademarks that vf licenses from others we may be unable to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction in some cases there may be trademark owners who have prior rights to vf’s trademarks because the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the us in other cases there may be holders who have prior rights to similar trademarks vf is from time to time involved in opposition and cancellation proceedings with respect to some of its intellectual property rights 

we may be subject to liability if third parties successfully claim that we infringe on their trademarks copyrights patents or other intellectual property rights defending infringement claims could be expensive and timeconsuming and might result in our entering into costly license agreements 

vf is subject to the risk that its licensees may not generate expected sales or maintain the value of vf’s brands 

during 2014 1274 million of vf’s revenues were derived from licensing royalties although vf generally has significant control over its licensees’ products and advertising we rely on our licensees for among other things operational and financial controls over their businesses failure of our licensees to successfully market licensed products or our inability to replace existing licensees if necessary could adversely affect vf’s revenues both directly from reduced royalties received and indirectly from reduced sales of our other products risks are also associated with a licensee’s ability to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition vf relies on its licensees to help preserve the value of its brands although we attempt to protect vf’s brands through approval rights over design production processes quality packaging merchandising distribution advertising and promotion of our licensed products we cannot completely control the use of licensed vf brands by our licensees the misuse of a brand by a licensee could have a material adverse effect on that brand and on vf 

vf has entered into license agreements to use the trademarks of others loss of a license could have an adverse effect on vf’s operating results 

vf has entered into agreements to market products under licenses granted by third parties including major league baseball the national football league and harleydavidson motor company inc some of these licenses are for a short term and do not contain renewal options loss of a license which in certain cases could result in an impairment charge for related operating and intangible assets could have an adverse effect on vf’s operating results 

  

if vf encounters problems with its distribution system vf’s ability to deliver its products to the market could be adversely affected 

vf relies on owned or independentlyoperated distribution facilities to warehouse and ship product to its customers vf’s distribution system includes computercontrolled and automated equipment which may be subject to a number of risks related to security or computer viruses the proper operation of software and hardware power interruptions or other system failures because substantially all of vf’s products are distributed from a relatively small number of locations vf’s operations could also be interrupted by earthquakes floods fires or other natural disasters affecting its distribution centers we maintain business interruption insurance but it may not adequately protect vf from the adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in vf’s distribution facilities such as the longterm loss of customers or an erosion of brand image in addition vf’s distribution capacity is dependent on the timely performance of services by third parties including the transportation of product to and from its distribution facilities if we encounter problems with our distribution system our ability to meet customer expectations manage inventory complete sales and achieve operating efficiencies could be materially adversely affected 

volatility in securities markets interest rates and other economic factors could substantially increase vf’s defined benefit pension costs 

vf currently has obligations under its defined benefit pension plans the funded status of the pension plans is dependent on many factors including returns on investment assets and the discount rate used to determine pension obligations unfavorable impacts from returns on plan assets decreases in discount rates changes in plan demographics or revisions in the applicable laws or regulations could materially change the timing and amount of pension funding requirements which could reduce cash available for vf’s business 

vf’s operating performance also may be negatively impacted by the amount of expense recorded for its pension plans pension expense is calculated using actuarial valuations that incorporate assumptions and estimates about financial market economic and demographic conditions differences between estimated and actual results give rise to gains and losses that are deferred and amortized as part of future pension expense which can create volatility that adversely impacts vf’s future operating results

 analysis of results of operations 

consolidated statements of income 

the following table presents a summary of the changes in total revenues during the last two years 

 

 vf reported revenue growth of 8 in 2014 this revenue growth was driven by a 13 increase in the outdoor  action sports coalition and continued strength in the international and directtoconsumer businesses which grew revenues by 9 and 19 respectively additionally vf uses a 5253 week fiscal year and 2014 included 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks in 2013 the extra week in 2014 added approximately 100 million of revenue and 1 of growth compared to 2013 additional details on revenues are provided in the section titled “information by business segment” 

vf’s most significant foreign currency exposure relates to business conducted in eurobased countries in addition vf conducts business in other developed and emerging markets around the world that results in exposure to foreign currencies other than the euro changes in foreign currency translation rates for all currencies negatively impacted revenue comparisons by 906 million in 2014 and positively impacted revenue comparisons by 458 million in 2013 

the following table presents the percentage relationship to total revenues for components of the consolidated statements of income 

 

 gross margin increased 70 basis points to 488 in 2014 compared with 481 in 2013 the increase in gross margin reflects the continued shift in our revenue mix towards higher margin businesses including 

  

outdoor  action sports and directtoconsumer as further discussed in the “directtoconsumer operations” section the 2014 change in classification of retail concession fees improved gross margin by 20 basis points and increased the ratio of selling general and administration expenses to revenues compared to 2013 

in 2013 gross margin increased 160 basis points to 481 compared with 465 in 2012 with improvements in nearly every coalition the increase in gross margin reflects lower product costs and the continued shift in the revenue mix towards higher margin businesses including outdoor  action sports international and directtoconsumer 

selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues were 30 basis points higher in 2014 compared with 2013 excluding the impact of the aforementioned change in classification of retail concession fees the percentage of selling general and administrative expenses to revenues did not change in 2014 compared with 2013 as the impact from increased investments in directtoconsumer businesses and marketing was offset by the leverage of operating expenses on higher revenues 

selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues were 50 basis points higher in 2013 compared with 2012 due to additional marketing and directtoconsumer investments to support future growth for our largest and fastest growing businesses partially offset by the leverage of operating expenses on higher revenues and lower acquisitionrelated expenses for the timberland company “timberland” 

as part of its annual impairment testing performed in the fourth quarter of 2014 vf recorded a 3964 million pretax noncash impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill and intangible assets related to our 7 for all mankind ®  splendid ® and ella moss ® brands to their respective estimated fair values no impairment charge was required in 2013 or 2012 for additional information see notes f g and t to the consolidated financial statements and the “critical accounting policies and estimates” section below 

in 2014 operating margin declined 270 basis points to 117 from 144 in 2013 the decrease in operating margin for 2014 reflects gross margin expansion and a 320 basis point decrease from the noncash impairment charge for goodwill and intangible assets 

in 2013 operating margin increased 90 basis points to 144 from 135 in 2012 the increase in operating margin for 2013 was due to improved gross margin and the leverage of operating expenses on higher revenues partially offset by increased marketing and directtoconsumer investments in 2013 

net interest expense decreased 08 million to 798 million in 2014 due to the repayment of 400 million of floating rate notes during the third quarter of 2013 and increased interest income on cash equivalents partially offset by higher average levels of shortterm borrowings in 2014 net interest expense decreased 96 million to 806 million in 2013 due to i lower average levels of shortterm borrowings ii the repayment of 4000 million of floating rate notes during the third quarter of 2013 and iii increased amounts of interest capitalized for significant projects 

outstanding interestbearing debt averaged 18 billion for 2014 19 billion for 2013 and 25 billion for 2012 with shortterm borrowings representing 22 10 and 25 of average debt outstanding for the respective years the weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt was 46 for 2014 45 for 2013 and 37 for 2012 the weighted average interest rate increased slightly in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to higher interest rates on international shortterm borrowings the weighted average interest rate increased in 2013 from 2012 primarily due to i lower average levels of shortterm borrowings which have lower interest rates than the average of all outstanding debt and ii fewer months outstanding of the 400 million floating rate debt which had a lower interest rate than the average of all outstanding debt and was repaid during the year 

other income expense netted to expense of 55 million in 2014 compared with expense of 40 million in 2013 the expense in both 2014 and 2013 was primarily due to foreign currency exchange losses 

  

other income expense netted to expense of 40 million in 2013 compared with income of 469 million in 2012 the expense in 2013 was primarily due to foreign currency exchange losses the income in 2012 was primarily due to the 420 million gain on the sale of vf’s 80 ownership in john varvatos enterprises inc “john varvatos” 

the effective income tax rate was 225 in 2014 compared with 226 in 2013 the 2014 tax rate included a net discrete tax benefit of 138 million primarily related to the retroactive impact of the tax increase prevention act of 2014 discussed below 53 million tax benefit and unrecognized tax benefits and interest net 114 million tax benefit partially offset by other discrete tax items net 29 million tax expense these discrete items collectively lowered the 2014 annual tax rate by 10 compared with 17 in 2013 without discrete items the effective tax rate during 2014 decreased by approximately 07 the international effective tax rate was 127 and 121 for 2014 and 2013 respectively 

the tax increase prevention act of 2014 signed into law in december 2014 retroactively extended certain tax credits and incentives through tax year 2014 the impact of this tax law change to the 2014 tax year was considered a discrete tax benefit when recorded in the fourth quarter of 2014 these tax incentives do not extend beyond 2014 and therefore have been excluded from future tax rates vf expects the 2015 annual tax rate to approximate 24 to 245 

the effective income tax rate for 2013 was 226 compared with 236 in 2012 the 2013 tax rate included a net 260 million in discrete tax benefits primarily related to the retroactive impact of the american tax relief act of 2012 87 million tax benefit prior year refund claims and tax credits 70 million tax benefit unrecognized tax benefits and interest net 59 million tax benefit and changes in valuation allowances for capital and operating loss carryforwards net 34 million tax benefit these discrete items collectively lowered the 2013 annual tax rate by 17 compared with 22 in 2012 without discrete items the effective tax rate during 2013 decreased by approximately 15 primarily due to the 2013 impact of tax law changes in the us related to the american tax relief act of 2012 and a higher percentage of income in lower tax rate jurisdictions compared with 2012 the international effective tax rate was 121 and 136 for 2013 and 2012 respectively 

net income attributable to vf corporation in 2014 decreased to 10 billion 238 per share compared with 12 billion 271 per share in 2013 the decrease in earnings per share in 2014 reflects improved operating performance as discussed in the “information by business segment” section below the aforementioned goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge which decreased earnings per share by 070 and the other factors described above 

net income attributable to vf corporation in 2013 increased to 12 billion 271 per share compared with 11 billion 243 per share in 2012 the increase in earnings per share in 2013 resulted primarily from improved operating performance as discussed in the “information by business segment” section below as well as the other factors described above in addition earnings per share in 2013 compared with 2012 benefited by 004 per share due to lower timberland acquisitionrelated expenses

 the jeanswear coalition consists of the global jeanswear businesses led by the wrangler ® and lee ® brands 

global jeanswear revenues were flat in 2014 over 2013 as an increase in global wrangler ® brand revenues was offset by decreases in global lee ® driven by declines in the us and rock  republic ® brand revenues foreign currency translation negatively impacted revenues by 430 million in 2014

as part of its annual impairment testing performed in the fourth quarter of 2014 vf recorded a 3964 million noncash impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill and intangible assets related to the 7 for all mankind ®  splendid ® and ella moss ® brands to their respective estimated fair values this charge was excluded from the coalition profit of contemporary brands since it is not part of the ongoing operations of the business for additional information see notes f g and t to the consolidated financial statements and the “critical accounting policies and estimates” section 

other 

 

 vf outlet ® stores in the us sell vf products at prices that are generally higher than what could be realized through external wholesale channels as well as other nonvf products revenues and profits of vf products sold in these stores are reported as part of the operating results of the applicable coalition while revenues and profits of nonvf products are reported in this “other” category 

reconciliation of coalition profit to consolidated income before income taxes 

there are three types of costs necessary to reconcile total coalition profit to consolidated income before income taxes these costs are i noncash impairment of goodwill and intangible assets which is excluded from coalition profit because these costs are not part of the ongoing operations of the respective businesses ii interest expense net which is excluded from coalition profit because substantially all financing costs are managed at the corporate office and are not under the control of coalition management and iii corporate and other expenses which are excluded from coalition profit to the extent they are not allocated to the coalitions impairment of goodwill and intangible assets and net interest expense are discussed in the “consolidated statements of income” section the corporate and other expenses are summarized as follows 

 

 information systems and shared services 

these costs include management information systems and the centralized finance supply chain human resources directtoconsumer and customer management functions that support worldwide operations operating costs of information systems and shared services are charged to the coalitions based on utilization of those services costs to develop new computer applications are generally not allocated to the coalitions the increases in information systems and shared services costs in 2014 and 2013 resulted from the overall growth of the 

  

businesses and costs associated with expanded software implementations and upgrades information systems and shared services costs in 2012 also included increased information systems spending related to the integration of timberland 

corporate headquarters’ costs 

headquarters’ costs include compensation and benefits of corporate management and staff legal and professional fees and general and administrative expenses that have not been allocated to the coalitions the increase in corporate headquarters’ costs in 2014 over 2013 was primarily driven by increases in cash and stockbased compensation resulting from corporate performance in excess of established goals and increases in vf’s share price the increase in corporate headquarters’ costs in 2013 over 2012 was primarily due to an increase in charitable contributions 

other 

this category includes i costs of corporate programs or corporatemanaged decisions that are not allocated to the coalitions ii costs of registering maintaining and enforcing certain of vf’s trademarks and iii miscellaneous consolidated costs the most significant of which is related to the expense of vf’s centrallymanaged us defined benefit pension plans the current year service cost component of pension expense is allocated to the coalitions while the remaining cost components totaling 320 million for 2014 609 million for 2013 and 672 million for 2012 are reported in corporate and other expenses the decrease in other expenses in 2014 compared with 2013 was driven by lower pension expense in 2014 compared with 2013 

the increase in other expenses in 2013 compared with 2012 was driven by the 420 million gain on the sale of john varvatos which was recorded as an offset to other expense in 2012 in addition an increase in deferred compensation expense in 2013 was partially offset by lower pension expense compared with 2012 

international operations 

international revenues grew 9 in 2014 compared with 2013 revenues in europe rose 8 with positive results from most vf brands sold in that region in the asia pacific region revenues increased 17 primarily driven by growth in china revenues in the americas nonus region increased 5 international revenues represented 38 of total vf revenues in both 2014 and 2013 foreign currency translation negatively impacted international revenues by 906 million in 2014 

directtoconsumer operations 

directtoconsumer revenues grew 19 in 2014 with doubledigit increases in all regions and growth in nearly every vf brand with a retail format new store openings comparable store growth and an expanding ecommerce business all contributed to the directtoconsumer revenue growth vf opened 188 stores in 2014 bringing the total number of vfowned retail stores to 1401 at december 2014 directtoconsumer revenues were 26 of total vf revenues in 2014 compared with 24 in 2013 22 in 2013 prior to the concession classification change discussed below 

concessions are retail store locations which are all outside the us where vf is responsible for all aspects of operations without ownership of the retail space under typical concession arrangements vf pays a concession fee for use of the space based on a percentage of retail sales beginning in 2014 we have included all revenues from concession retail stores in our directtoconsumer revenues in addition we began classifying all concession fees as a component of selling general and administrative expenses instead of the previous treatment as an offset to revenue in the consolidated statements of income we made these changes to better represent the operations of our directtoconsumer business these changes in classification did not impact operating income the 2013 and 2012 reported balances have not been restated in the consolidated statements of income because the impact is immaterial however comparative references to directtoconsumer and wholesale revenue growth rates reflect the reclassification of concession revenues to the directtoconsumer channel as if the change had occurred at the beginning of each reporting period 

  

analysis of financial condition 

balance sheets 

the following discussion refers to significant changes in balances at december 2014 compared with december 2013 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the funded status of the defined benefit pension plans is reflected in the balance sheet as the excess or deficiency of pension plan assets compared with projected benefit obligations payable to plan participants the underfunded status of the defined benefit pension plans was 3717 million at the end of 2014 compared with 2212 million at the end of 2013 the decline in the funded status as of december 2014 was due to an increase in the projected benefit obligations caused primarily by lower discount rates and increased mortality expectations partially offset by an increase in pension plan assets due to a 500 million discretionary contribution to the domestic qualified plan in december 2014 vf made an additional 2500 million discretionary contribution to the domestic qualified plan in january 2015 which significantly improved the underfunded status subsequent to yearend see the “critical accounting policies and estimates” section below and note m to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the defined benefit pension plans 

liquidity and cash flows 

the financial condition of vf is reflected in the following 

 

 for the ratio of debt to total capital debt is defined as shortterm and longterm debt and total capital is defined as debt plus stockholders’ equity the ratio of net debt to total net capital with net debt defined as debt less cash and equivalents and total net capital defined as total capital less cash and equivalents was 78 at december 2014 and 100 at december 2013 

  

in summary our cash flows were as follows 

 

 cash provided by operating activities 

vf’s primary source of liquidity is the strong cash flow provided by operating activities which is dependent on the level of net income and changes in working capital cash provided by operating activities was 17 billion in 2014 15 billion in 2013 and 13 billion in 2012 although net income decreased in 2014 due to the impairment charge for goodwill and intangible assets cash provided by operations increased in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to i improved operating performance ii increased accounts receivable collections during the 53rd week and iii the net impact of changes in noncash adjustments primarily related to pension obligations impairment charges depreciation and amortization and deferred taxes these cash flow increases were partially offset by the impact of higher inventory levels at the end of 2014 compared with 2013 due to anticipated revenue growth in the first quarter of 2015 

the improvement in cash provided by operations in 2013 compared with 2012 is due to the increase in net income and higher levels of noncash adjustments related to i pension and deferred compensation obligations ii depreciation and amortization and iii the 2012 gain on the sale of john varvatos the net change in operating assets and liabilities was essentially the same in 2013 and 2012 reflecting a slightly improved use of working capital considering the growth in the business 

cash used by investing activities 

cash used by investing activities was 3293 million in 2014 3503 million in 2013 and 2203 million in 2012 vf’s investing activities in 2014 related primarily to capital expenditures of 2341 million and software purchases of 679 million capital expenditures decreased 371 million in 2014 compared with 2013 due to the completion of a number of significant projects during 2013 software purchases increased 140 million over the 2013 period due to system implementations and a new software license agreement that supports our ecommerce infrastructure and other key business functions vf expects capital spending to approximate 2250 million in 2015 to support continued growth this spending is expected to be funded by cash flow from operations 

vf’s investing activities in 2013 related primarily to capital expenditures of 2712 million and software purchases of 540 million which increased a combined 423 million compared with 2012 the higher levels of spending were related to a number of infrastructure projects that support vf’s continued experience and expectations for revenue growth including i a european headquarters ii additional distribution facilities iii new retail stores and iv system implementations 

cash used by financing activities 

cash used by financing activities was 11 billion in 2014 9838 million in 2013 and 8025 million in 2012 the increase in cash used by financing activities in 2014 compared with 2013 was driven by an increase of 4458 million in open market purchases of common stock and an increase of 768 million in cash dividends paid partially offset by a 4001 million decrease in payments of longterm debt the increase in cash used by financing activities in 2013 compared with 2012 was primarily due to the repayment of 4000 million of debt and a 689 million increase in cash dividends paid in addition shortterm borrowings used to fund the timberland acquisition in 2012 were repaid in 2013 

during 2014 2013 and 2012 vf purchased 120 million 68 million and 80 million shares respectively of its common stock in open market transactions the respective cost was 7278 million 2821 million and 2997 million with an average price per share of 6046 in 2014 4119 in 2013 and 3713 in 2012 

  

as of the end of 2014 the company had 407 million shares remaining under its current share repurchase program authorized by vf’s board of directors from january 5 2015 to february 27 2015 the company repurchased an additional 97 million shares of common stock in open market transactions for 7065 million average price per share of 7288 vf will continue to evaluate future share repurchases considering funding required for business acquisitions vf’s common stock price and levels of stock option exercises 

vf relies on continued strong cash generation to finance its ongoing operations in addition vf has significant liquidity from its available cash balances and credit facilities vf maintains a 125 billion senior unsecured revolving line of credit the “global credit facility” which supports its 125 billion us commercial paper program for shortterm seasonal working capital requirements the global credit facility expires in december 2016 as of december 2014 there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding and the entire amount of the global credit facility was available for borrowing except for 165 million of standby letters of credit issued on behalf of vf 

vf’s favorable credit agency ratings allow for access to additional liquidity at competitive rates at the end of 2014 vf’s longterm debt ratings were ‘a’ by standard  poor’s ratings services and ‘a3’ by moody’s investors service and commercial paper ratings by those rating agencies were ‘a1’ and ‘prime2’ respectively none of vf’s longterm debt agreements contain acceleration of maturity clauses based solely on changes in credit ratings however if there were a change in control of vf and as a result of the change in control the 2017 2021 and 2037 notes were rated below investment grade by recognized rating agencies vf would be obligated to repurchase the notes at 101 of the aggregate principal amount of notes repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest 

cash dividends totaled 11075 per common share in 2014 compared with 09150 in 2013 and 07575 in 2012 the dividend payout rate was 465 of diluted earnings per share in 2014 360 excluding the effects of the noncash goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge 338 in 2013 and 312 in 2012 the current indicated annual dividend rate for 2015 is 128 per share 

as of december 2014 approximately 5270 million of cash and shortterm investments was held by international subsidiaries whose undistributed earnings are considered permanently reinvested vf’s intent is to reinvest these funds in international operations if management decides at a later date to repatriate these funds to the us vf would be required to provide taxes on these amounts based on applicable us tax rates net of foreign taxes already paid 

following is a summary of vf’s contractual obligations and commercial commitments at the end of 2014 that will require the use of funds 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

 vf had other financial commitments at the end of 2014 that are not included in the above table but may require the use of funds under certain circumstances 

 

  

  

  

 management believes that vf’s cash balances and funds provided by operating activities as well as unused bank credit lines additional borrowing capacity and access to capital markets taken as a whole provide i adequate liquidity to meet all of its current and longterm obligations when due ii adequate liquidity to fund capital expenditures and to maintain the dividend payout policy and iii flexibility to meet investment opportunities that may arise 

vf does not participate in transactions with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships established to facilitate offbalance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes 

risk management 

vf is exposed to risks in the ordinary course of business management regularly assesses and manages exposures to these risks through operating and financing activities and when appropriate by i taking advantage 

  

of natural hedges within vf ii purchasing insurance from commercial carriers or iii using derivative financial instruments some potential risks are discussed below 

insured risks 

vf selfinsures a substantial portion of employee group medical worker’s compensation vehicle property director and officer and general liability exposures and purchases insurance from highlyrated commercial carriers for losses in excess of retained exposures 

cash and equivalents risks 

vf had 9719 million of cash and equivalents at the end of 2014 including demand deposits money market funds and shortterm time deposits management continually monitors the credit ratings of the financial institutions with whom vf conducts business similarly management monitors the credit quality of cash equivalents 

defined benefit pension plan risks 

at the end of 2014 vf’s defined benefit pension plans were underfunded by 3717 million which is recorded as a net liability in the consolidated balance sheet vf has made significant cash contributions in recent years to improve the funded status of the plans including discretionary contributions to the domestic qualified plan of 500 million in 2014 and 1000 million in 2013 in january 2015 vf made another discretionary contribution to the domestic qualified plan of 2500 million which significantly improved vf’s overall underfunded status and fully funded the domestic qualified plan vf will continue to evaluate the funded status and future funding requirements of these plans which depends in part on the future performance of the plans’ investment portfolios management believes that vf has sufficient liquidity to make any required contributions to the pension plans in future years 

vf’s reported earnings are subject to risks due to the volatility of its pension expense pension expense has ranged from 579 million to 927 million over the last three years with the fluctuations primarily due to varying amounts of actuarial gains and losses that are deferred and amortized to future years’ expense the assumptions that impact actuarial gains and losses include the rate of return on investments held by the pension plans the discount rate used to value participant liabilities and demographic characteristics of the participants 

vf has taken several steps to manage the risk and volatility in the pension plans and their impact on the financial statements in 2005 vf’s us defined benefit plans were closed to new entrants which did not affect the benefits of existing plan participants at that date or their accrual of future benefits in more recent years the investment strategy of the us defined benefit plan has been revised to define dynamic asset allocation targets that are dependent upon changes in the plan’s funded status capital market expectations and risk tolerance management will continue to evaluate actions that may help to reduce vf’s risks related to its defined benefit plans 

interest rate risks 

vf limits the risk of interest rate fluctuations by managing the mix of fixed and variable interest rate debt in addition vf may use derivative financial instruments to manage risk since a significant portion of vf’s longterm debt has fixed interest rates the exposure primarily relates to changes in interest rates on variable rate shortterm borrowings which averaged 4090 million during 2014 however any change in interest rates would also affect interest income earned on vf’s cash equivalents based on the average amount of variable rate borrowings and cash equivalents during 2014 the effect on reported net income of a hypothetical 10 change in interest rates is approximately 06 million 

  

foreign currency exchange rate risks 

vf is a global enterprise subject to the risk of foreign currency fluctuations approximately 38 of vf’s revenues in 2014 were generated in international markets most of vf’s foreign businesses operate in functional currencies other than the us dollar in periods where the us dollar strengthens relative to the euro or other foreign currencies where vf has operations there is a negative impact on vf’s operating results upon translation of those foreign operating results into the us dollar vf does not hedge the translation of foreign currency operating results into the us dollar however management does hedge foreign currency transactions as discussed later in this section 

the reported values of assets and liabilities in these foreign businesses are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for net advances to and investments in vf’s foreign businesses that are considered to be longterm the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on those longterm advances are deferred as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders’ equity the us dollar value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries fluctuates with changes in the underlying functional currencies vf generally does not hedge this balance sheet translation exposure 

vf monitors net foreign currency market exposures and enters into derivative foreign currency contracts to hedge the effects of exchange rate fluctuations for a significant portion of forecasted foreign currency cash flows or specific foreign currency transactions relating to crossborder inventory purchases production costs product sales and intercompany royalty payments vf’s practice is to buy or sell primarily us dollar contracts that cover up to 80 of foreign currency exposures for periods of up to 24 months currently vf uses only forward exchange contracts but may use options or collars in the future this use of financial instruments allows management to reduce the overall exposure to risks from exchange rate fluctuations on vf’s cash flows and earnings since gains and losses on these contracts will offset losses and gains on the transactions being hedged 

for cash flow hedging contracts outstanding at the end of 2014 if there were a hypothetical change in foreign currency exchange rates of 10 compared with rates at the end of 2014 it would result in a change in fair value of those contracts of approximately 1432 million however any change in the fair value of the hedging contracts would be offset by a change in the fair value of the underlying hedged exposure impacted by the currency rate changes 

counterparty risks 

vf is exposed to creditrelated losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to derivative hedging instruments to manage this risk we have established counterparty credit guidelines and only enter into derivative transactions with financial institutions with ‘a minusa3’ investment grade credit ratings or better vf continually monitors the credit rating of and limits the amount hedged with each counterparty additionally management utilizes a portfolio of financial institutions to minimize exposure to potential counterparty defaults and adjusts positions as necessary vf also monitors counterparty risk for derivative contracts within the defined benefit pension plans 

commodity price risks 

vf is exposed to market risks for the pricing of cotton leather rubber wool and other materials which we either purchase directly or in a converted form such as fabric or shoe soles to manage risks of commodity price changes management negotiates prices in advance when possible vf has not historically managed commodity price exposures by using derivative instruments 

  

deferred compensation and related investment security risks 

vf has nonqualified deferred compensation plans in which liabilities to the plans’ participants are based on the market values of the participants’ selection of a hypothetical portfolio of investment funds including vf common stock vf invests in a portfolio of securities that substantially mirrors the participants’ investment selections the increases and decreases in deferred compensation liabilities except for the participants’ investment selections in vf common stock are substantially offset by corresponding increases and decreases in the market value of vf’s investments resulting in an insignificant net exposure to operating results and financial position the vf common stock is treated as treasury shares for financial reporting purposes so any gains or losses on those shares result in exposure to operating results and financial position as a result of the change in participant liabilities 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

vf has chosen accounting policies that management believes are appropriate to accurately and fairly report vf’s operating results and financial position in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us vf applies these accounting policies in a consistent manner significant accounting policies are summarized in note a to the consolidated financial statements 

the application of these accounting policies requires that vf make estimates and assumptions about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses contingent assets and liabilities and related disclosures these estimates assumptions and judgments are based on historical experience current trends and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis because vf’s business cycle is relatively short ie from the date that inventory is received until that inventory is sold and the trade receivable is collected actual results related to most estimates are known within a few months after any balance sheet date in addition vf may retain outside specialists to assist in valuations of business acquisitions impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets equity compensation pension benefits and selfinsured liabilities if actual results ultimately differ from previous estimates the revisions are included in results of operations when the actual amounts become known 

vf believes the following accounting policies involve the most significant management estimates assumptions and judgments used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements or are the most sensitive to change from outside factors the application of these critical accounting policies and estimates is discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors 

inventories 

vf’s inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value cost includes all material labor and overhead costs incurred to manufacture or purchase the finished goods overhead allocated to manufactured product is based on the normal capacity of plants and does not include amounts related to idle capacity or abnormal production inefficiencies vf performs a detailed review at each business unit at least quarterly of all inventories on the basis of individual styles or individual stylesizecolor stock keeping units to identify slow moving or excess products discontinued and tobediscontinued products and offquality merchandise this review matches inventory on hand plus current production and purchase commitments with current and expected future sales orders management performs an evaluation to estimate market value using a systematic and consistent methodology of forecasting future demand market conditions and selling prices if the estimated market value is less than cost vf provides an allowance to reflect the lower value of that inventory this methodology recognizes inventory exposures at the time such losses are evident rather than at the time goods are actually sold historically these estimates of future demand and selling prices have not varied significantly from actual results due to vf’s timely identification and rapid disposal of these reduced value inventories 

physical inventory counts are taken on a regular basis vf provides for estimated inventory losses that have likely occurred since the last physical inventory date historically physical inventory shrinkage has not been significant vf also conducts cycle counts at most locations throughout the year 

  

longlived assets including goodwill and intangible assets 

vf allocates the purchase price of an acquired business to the fair values of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed with any excess purchase price recorded as goodwill vf evaluates fair value at acquisition using three valuation techniques — the replacement cost market and income methods — and weights the valuation methods based on what is most appropriate in the circumstances the process of assigning fair values particularly to acquired intangible assets is highly subjective 

fair value for acquired intangible assets is generally based on the present value of expected cash flows indefinitelived trademark or trade name intangible assets collectively referred to herein as “trademarks” represent individually acquired trademarks some of which are registered in multiple countries definitelived customer relationship intangible assets are based on the value of relationships with wholesale customers at the time of acquisition definitelived license intangible assets relate to numerous licensing contracts with vf as either the licensor or licensee goodwill represents the excess of cost of an acquired business over the fair value of net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired and is assigned at the reporting unit level 

vf’s depreciation policies for property plant and equipment reflect judgments on their estimated economic lives and residual value if any vf’s amortization policies for definitelived intangible assets reflect judgments on the estimated amounts and duration of future cash flows expected to be generated by those assets in evaluating the amortizable life for customer relationship intangible assets management considers historical attrition patterns for various groups of customers for licenserelated intangible assets management considers historical trends and anticipated license renewal periods 

vf’s policy is to review property plant and equipment and definitelived intangible assets for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable vf tests for potential impairment at the asset or asset group level which is the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent vf measures recoverability of the carrying value of an asset or asset group by comparison with estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if forecasted undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset are not expected to be adequate to recover the asset’s carrying value a fair value analysis must be performed and an impairment charge is recorded if there is an excess of the asset’s carrying value over its estimated fair value 

when testing customer relationship intangible assets for potential impairment management considers historical customer attrition rates and projected revenues and profitability related to customers that existed at acquisition management uses the multiperiod excess earnings method which is a specific application of the discounted cash flow method to value customer relationship assets under this method vf calculates the present value of the aftertax cash flows expected to be generated by the customer relationship asset after deducting contributory asset charges 

vf’s policy is to evaluate indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill for possible impairment as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable as part of its annual impairment testing vf may elect to assess qualitative factors as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform quantitative impairment testing if management’s assessment of these qualitative factors indicates that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset or reporting unit is less than its carrying value then no further testing is required otherwise the intangible asset or reporting unit must be quantitatively tested for impairment 

an indefinitelived intangible asset is quantitatively tested for possible impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset with its carrying value fair value of an indefinitelived trademark is based on an income approach using the relieffromroyalty method under this method forecasted revenues for products sold with the trademark are assigned a royalty rate that would be charged to license the trademark in lieu of ownership and the fair value is calculated as the present value of those forecasted royalties avoided by owning 

  

the trademark the appropriate discount rate is based on the reporting unit’s weighted average cost of capital “wacc” that considers market participant assumptions plus a spread that factors in the risk of the intangible asset the royalty rate is selected based on consideration of i royalty rates included in active license agreements if applicable ii royalty rates received by market participants in the apparel industry and iii the current performance of the reporting unit if the estimated fair value of the trademark intangible asset exceeds its carrying value there is no impairment charge if the estimated fair value of the trademark is less than its carrying value an impairment charge would be recognized for the difference 

goodwill is quantitatively evaluated for possible impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value reporting units are businesses with discrete financial information that is available and reviewed by coalition management in the first step of the quantitative goodwill impairment test vf compares the carrying value of a reporting unit including its recorded goodwill to the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 

for goodwill impairment testing vf estimates the fair value of a reporting unit using both incomebased and marketbased valuation methods the incomebased approach is based on the reporting unit’s forecasted future cash flows that are discounted to present value using the reporting unit’s wacc discussed above for the marketbased approach management uses both the guideline company and similar transaction methods the guideline company method analyzes market multiples of revenues and earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” for a group of comparable public companies the market multiples used in the valuation are based on the relative strengths and weaknesses of the reporting unit compared to the selected guideline companies under the similar transactions method valuation multiples are calculated utilizing actual transaction prices and revenueebitda data from target companies deemed similar to the reporting unit 

based on the range of estimated fair values developed from the income and marketbased methods vf determines the estimated fair value for the reporting unit if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value the goodwill is not impaired and no further review is required however if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value vf performs the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the impairment charge if any the second step involves a hypothetical allocation of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill and liabilities as if the reporting unit were newly acquired which results in an implied fair value of the goodwill the amount of the impairment charge is the excess of the recorded goodwill if any over the implied fair value of the goodwill 

the incomebased fair value methodology requires management’s assumptions and judgments regarding economic conditions in the markets in which vf operates and conditions in the capital markets many of which are outside of management’s control at the reporting unit level fair value estimation requires management’s assumptions and judgments regarding the effects of overall economic conditions on the specific reporting unit along with assessment of the reporting unit’s strategies and forecasts of future cash flows forecasts of individual reporting unit cash flows involve management’s estimates and assumptions regarding 

 

  

  

 under the marketbased fair value methodology judgment is required in evaluating market multiples and recent transactions management believes that the assumptions used for its impairment tests are representative of those that would be used by market participants performing similar valuations of vf’s reporting units 

  

management concluded that no triggering events occurred during 2014 related to goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets as such management performed its annual goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment testing as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2014 vf elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative analysis for the splendid ® and ella moss ® and lucy ® reporting units and for the splendid ® and ella moss ®  7 for all mankind ® and lucy ® trademark intangible assets management performed a qualitative analysis for all other reporting units and trademark intangible assets as discussed below in the “other reporting units — qualitative impairment analysis” section 

splendid ® and ella moss ® impairment analysis 

vf performed a quantitative impairment analysis of the goodwill and trademark intangible asset for the splendid ® and ella moss ® reporting unit as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2014 and concluded that both the goodwill and the trademark were impaired accordingly management recorded an impairment charge for the entire goodwill balance of 1424 million and an impairment charge of 457 million to bring the trademark to its estimated fair value of 532 million additionally management concluded that a triggering event occurred related to the splendid ® and ella moss ® definitelived customer relationship asset as a result of management’s annual strategic plan review conducted in the fourth quarter management performed a quantitative impairment analysis and recorded a 642 million impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the splendid ® and ella moss ® customer relationship asset to its estimated fair value of 124 million 

the splendid ® and ella moss ® reporting unit acquired in 2009 sells premium tops and casual apparel primarily in the women’s contemporary apparel space recent performance of the brand has been negatively impacted by challenging consumer trends in women’s contemporary apparel which has led to reduced foot traffic and increased promotional activity in department stores and in our vfoperated stores management’s revenue and profitability forecasts used in the splendid ® and ella moss ® goodwill and intangible asset valuations were developed in conjunction with management’s annual strategic plan review conducted in the fourth quarter and our resulting revised outlook for business performance and considered recent performance and trends strategic initiatives and the general softness of the contemporary apparel market 

key assumptions developed by vf management and used in our quantitative analysis of the splendid ® and ella moss ® reporting unit trademark and customer relationship assets include 

 

  

  

  

  

 in addition the customer relationship asset valuation considered historical attrition rates revenues and profitability related to wholesale customers that existed at acquisition 

7 for all mankind ® impairment analysis 

vf performed a fair value assessment of the trademark intangible asset at the 7 for all mankind ® reporting unit as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2014 all goodwill related to the 7 for all mankind ® reporting unit was written off as part of the 2010 impairment analysis a portion of the original value of the trademark was impaired 66 million as part of the 2010 impairment analysis and was written down to its estimated fair value of 3052 million at that time in 2014 we recorded an additional 876 million impairment charge to reduce the 7 for all mankind ® trademark to its estimated fair value of 2076 million additionally management concluded 

  

that a triggering event occurred related to the 7 for all mankind ® definitelived customer relationship intangible asset as a result of management’s annual strategic plan review conducted in the fourth quarter management performed a quantitative impairment analysis and recorded a 566 million impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the 7 for all mankind ® customer relationship asset to its estimated fair value of 440 million 

the 7 for all mankind ® reporting unit acquired in 2007 markets premium denim through upscale department stores specialty stores and vfoperated stores recent performance by the brand has been negatively impacted by ongoing challenges in the premium denim market management’s revenue and profitability forecasts used in the 7 for all mankind ® intangible asset valuations were developed in conjunction with management’s annual strategic plan review conducted in the fourth quarter and our resulting revised outlook for business performance and considered recent performance and trends strategic initiatives and the general softness of the premium denim market 

key assumptions developed by vf management and used in our quantitative analysis of the 7 for all mankind ® trademark and customer relationship assets include 

 

  

  

 in addition the customer relationship asset valuation considered historical attrition rates revenues and profitability related to wholesale customers that existed at acquisition 

lucy ® impairment analysis 

as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2014 vf performed a quantitative impairment analysis of the goodwill and trademark intangible asset for the lucy ® reporting unit and concluded that both the goodwill and the trademark were not impaired for goodwill the estimated fair value exceeded the reporting unit’s carrying value by approximately 30 the estimated fair value of the trademark intangible asset exceeded its carrying value by a significant amount 

the lucy ® reporting unit acquired in 2007 markets women’s activewear through vfoperated stores and more recently in the wholesale channel through specialty and premium sporting goods retailers as part of the 2009 annual impairment analysis a portion of the lucy ® goodwill 123 million and trademark 97 million were written down to their estimated fair values of 393 million and 403 million respectively 

vf is optimistic about the lucy ® brand due to i the recent expansion of the wholesale business with major retailers ii the recent launch and success of new product introductions and iii the current condition of the “athleisure” apparel space which is trending above the overall apparel market key assumptions developed by vf management and used in our quantitative analysis of the lucy ® reporting unit and trademark asset include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

actual results for the lucy ® reporting unit may vary from projected results accordingly management performed sensitivity analysis on the impairment models and concluded that the reporting unit goodwill and trademark intangible asset were not impaired even with significant negative changes made to key assumptions for example a 50 decrease in the forecasted cumulative average revenue growth rate used in the trademark intangible asset impairment model did not cause its estimated fair value to decline below carrying value similarly for goodwill a 20 decrease in projected cash flows did not cause the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to decline below its carrying value separately a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate did not cause the estimated fair value of the lucy ® reporting unit or trademark intangible asset to decline below their respective carrying values 

other reporting units — qualitative impairment analysis 

for all other reporting units vf elected to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the goodwill and trademark intangible assets in those reporting units were impaired in this qualitative assessment vf considered relevant events and circumstances for each reporting unit including i current year results ii financial performance versus management’s annual and fiveyear strategic plans iii changes in the reporting unit carrying value since prior year iv industry and market conditions in which the reporting unit operates v macroeconomic conditions including discount rate changes and vi changes in products or services offered by the reporting unit if applicable performance in recent years was compared to forecasts included in prior valuations based on the results of the qualitative assessment vf concluded that it was not more likely than not that the carrying values of the goodwill and trademark intangible assets were greater than their fair values and that further quantitative testing was not necessary 

management’s use of estimates and assumptions 

it is possible that vf’s conclusions regarding impairment or recoverability of goodwill or intangible assets in any reporting unit could change in future periods there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions used in our goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing performed as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2014 will prove to be accurate predictions of the future if for example i the businesses do not perform as projected ii overall economic conditions in 2015 or future years vary from current assumptions including changes in discount rates iii business conditions or strategies for a specific reporting unit change from current assumptions including loss of major customers iv investors require higher rates of return on equity investments in the marketplace or v enterprise values of comparable publicly traded companies or actual sales transactions of comparable companies were to decline resulting in lower multiples of revenues and ebitda 

a future impairment charge for goodwill or intangible assets could have a material effect on vf’s consolidated financial position and results of operations 

stock options 

vf uses a lattice optionpricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees and nonemployee members of the board of directors vf believes that a lattice model provides a refined estimate of the fair value of options because it can incorporate i historical option exercise patterns and multiple assumptions about future option exercise patterns for each of several groups of option holders and ii inputs that vary over time such as assumptions for interest rates and volatility management performs an annual review of all assumptions employed in the valuation of option grants and believes they are reflective of the outstanding options and underlying common stock and of groups of option participants the lattice valuation incorporates the assumptions listed in note o to the consolidated financial statements 

one of the critical assumptions in the valuation process is estimating the expected average life of the options before they are exercised for each option grant vf estimated the expected average life based on evaluations of 

  

the historical and expected option exercise patterns for each of the groups of option holders that have historically exhibited different option exercise patterns these evaluations included i voluntary stock option exercise patterns based on a combination of changes in the price of vf common stock and periods of time that options are outstanding before exercise and ii involuntary exercise patterns resulting from turnover retirement and mortality 

volatility is another critical assumption requiring judgment management bases its estimates of future volatility on a combination of implied and historical volatility implied volatility is based on shortterm 6 to 9 months publicly traded nearthemoney options on vf common stock vf measures historical volatility over a tenyear period corresponding to the contractual term of the options using daily stock prices management’s assumption for valuation purposes is that expected volatility starts at a level equal to the implied volatility and then transitions to the historical volatility over the remainder of the tenyear option term 

pension obligations 

vf sponsors a qualified defined benefit pension plan covering most fulltime us employees hired before 2005 and an unfunded supplemental defined benefit pension plan that provides benefits in excess of the limitations imposed by income tax regulations vf also sponsors defined benefit pension plans covering selected international employees the selection of actuarial assumptions for determining the projected pension benefit liabilities and annual pension expense is significant due to amounts involved and the long time period over which benefits are accrued and paid 

management reviews annually the principal economic actuarial assumptions summarized in note m to the consolidated financial statements and revises them as appropriate based on current rates and trends vf also periodically reviews and revises as necessary other plan assumptions such as rates of compensation increases retirement termination disability and mortality vf believes the assumptions appropriately reflect the participants’ demographics and projected benefit obligations of the plans and result in the best estimate of the plans’ future experience actual results may vary from the actuarial assumptions used 

the below discussion of discount rate return on assets and mortality assumptions relate specifically to the us pension plans as they comprise over 90 of plan assets and projected benefit obligations of the combined us and international plans 

one of the critical assumptions used in the actuarial model is the discount rate which is used to estimate the present value of future cash outflows necessary to meet projected benefit obligations for the specific plan it is the estimated interest rate that vf could use to settle its projected benefit obligations at the valuation date the discount rate assumption is based on current market interest rates vf selects a discount rate for each of the us pension plans by matching high quality corporate bond yields to the timing of projected benefit payments to participants in each plan vf uses the population of us corporate bonds rated ‘aa’ by moody’s investors service or standard  poor’s ratings services from this population of approximately 715 such bonds having at least 500 million outstanding that are noncallablenonputable unless with makewhole provisions vf excluded the highest and lowest yielding bonds each plan’s projected benefit payments are matched to current market interest rates over the expected payment period to calculate an associated present value a single equivalent discount rate is then determined that produces the same present value the resulting discount rate is reflective of both the current interest rate environment and the plan’s distinct liability characteristics vf believes that those ‘aa’ rated issues meet the “high quality” intent of the applicable accounting standards and that the 2014 discount rates of 405 for the us qualified defined benefit pension plan and 400 for the unfunded supplemental defined benefit plan appropriately reflect current market conditions and the longterm nature of projected benefit payments to participants in the us pension plans these lower discount rates compared with the rates of 500 for the us qualified defined benefit pension plan and 490 for the unfunded supplemental defined benefit plan at the end of 2013 reflects the general decline in yields of us government obligations and high quality corporate bonds during 2014 the discount rate for the plans may differ from the rates used by other companies 

  

because of longer expected duration of benefit payments reflecting i the higher percentage of female participants who generally have a longer life expectancy than males and ii the higher percentage of inactive participants who will not begin receiving vested benefits for many years 

another critical assumption of the actuarial model is the expected longterm rate of return on investments vf’s investment objective is to invest in a diversified portfolio of assets with an acceptable level of risk to maximize the longterm return while minimizing volatility of the value of plan assets relative to the value of plan liabilities these risks include market interest rate credit liquidity regulatory and foreign securities risks investment assets consist of domestic and international equity corporate and governmental fixed income and alternative assets vf develops a projected rate of return for each of the investment asset classes based on many factors including historical and expected returns the estimated inflation rate the premium to be earned in excess of a riskfree return the premium for equity risk and the premium for longer duration fixed income securities the weighted average projected longterm rates of return of the various assets held by the qualified plan provide the basis for the expected longterm rate of return actuarial assumption vf’s rate of return assumption was 650 in 2014 700 in 2013 and 750 in 2012 in recent years vf has altered the investment mix by i increasing the allocation to fixed income investments and reducing the allocation to equity investments ii increasing the allocation in equities to more international investments and iii adding alternative assets as an asset class the changes in asset allocation are anticipated over time to reduce the yeartoyear variability of the domestic plan’s funded status and resulting pension expense based on an evaluation of market conditions and projected market returns vf will be using a rate of return assumption of 625 for the us plan for 2015 management monitors the plan’s asset allocation to balance anticipated investment returns with risk in a given year 

we consistently review all of our demographic assumptions as part of the normal management of our defined benefit plans and update these assumptions as appropriate in 2014 the society of actuaries issued new mortality tables rp2014 and mortality improvement scales mp2014 which reflect longer life expectancies than the previous tables this updated information was considered along with the characteristics of our planspecific populations and other data where appropriate in developing our best estimate of the expected mortality rates of plan participants in the us pension plans the update resulted in an increase in our projected benefit obligation of approximately 693 million which is included in the projected benefit obligation shown in note m to the consolidated financial statements 

differences between actual results in a given year and the actuarially determined assumed results for that year eg investment performance discount rates and other assumptions do not affect that year’s pension expense but instead are deferred as unrecognized actuarial gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheet at the end of 2014 there were 5888 million of pretax accumulated deferred actuarial losses plus 220 million of pretax deferred prior service costs resulting in an after tax amount of 3771 million in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the 2014 consolidated balance sheet these deferred losses will be amortized over the average remaining service period as a component of pension expense 

pension expense recognized in the financial statements was 579 million in 2014 895 million in 2013 and 927 million in 2012 this compares with the cost of pension benefits actually earned by covered active employees commonly called “service cost” of 242 million in 2014 254 million in 2013 and 232 million in 2012 pension expense has been significantly higher than the annual service cost in recent years due to the amortization of prior years’ unrecognized actuarial losses as discussed in the preceding paragraph looking forward vf expects 2015 pension expense to increase to approximately 616 million due to increased amortization of unrealized losses driven by a decrease in the discount rate and an increase in the expected mortality assumption partially offset by discretionary funding of 500 million and 2500 million in december 2014 and january 2015 respectively 

  

the sensitivity of changes in actuarial assumptions on 2014 pension expense and on projected benefit obligations related to the us defined benefit pension plan at the end of 2014 all other factors being equal is illustrated by the following 

 

 as discussed in the “risk management” section above vf has taken several steps to reduce volatility in the pension plans and their impact on the financial statements on a longerterm basis vf believes the yeartoyear variability of the retirement benefit expense should decrease 

income taxes 

as a global company vf is subject to income taxes and files income tax returns in over 100 domestic and foreign jurisdictions each year almost every jurisdiction in which vf operates has a lower effective income tax rate than the us as discussed in note p to the consolidated financial statements vf has been granted a lower effective income tax rate on taxable earnings in certain foreign jurisdictions we do not currently believe there is substantial risk to our ability to maintain a low foreign effective tax rate based on the economic conditions of the jurisdictions in which we operate however vf makes an ongoing assessment to identify any significant exposure related to increases in tax rates in these foreign jurisdictions and will supplement future disclosures as applicable 

the calculation of income tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations which are subject to legal interpretation and significant management judgment vf’s income tax returns are regularly examined by federal state and foreign tax authorities and those audits may result in proposed adjustments vf has reviewed all issues raised upon examination as well as any exposure for issues that may be raised in future examinations vf has evaluated these potential issues under the “morelikelythannot” standard of the accounting literature a tax position is recognized if it meets this standard and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized such judgments and estimates may change based on audit settlements court cases and interpretation of tax laws and regulations income tax expense could be materially affected to the extent vf prevails in a tax position or when the statute of limitations expires for a tax position for which a liability for unrecognized tax benefits or valuation allowances has been established or to the extent vf is required to pay amounts greater than the established liability for unrecognized tax benefits vf does not currently anticipate any material impact on earnings from the ultimate resolution of income tax uncertainties there are no accruals for general or unknown tax expenses 

vf has 1153 million of gross deferred income tax assets related to operating loss and capital loss carryforwards and 889 million of valuation allowances against those assets realization of deferred tax assets related to operating loss and capital loss carryforwards is dependent on future taxable income in specific jurisdictions the amount and timing of which are uncertain and on possible changes in tax laws if management believes that vf will not be able to generate sufficient taxable income or capital gains to offset losses during the carryforward periods vf records valuation allowances to reduce those deferred tax assets to amounts expected to be ultimately realized in addition vf has 79 million of valuation allowances against deferred income tax assets unrelated to operating loss and capital loss carryforwards if in a future period management determines that the amount of deferred tax assets to be realized differs from the net recorded amount vf would record an adjustment to income tax expense in that future period 

  

vf has not provided us income taxes on a portion of the foreign subsidiaries’ undistributed earnings because these earnings are permanently reinvested in the respective foreign jurisdictions vf has not determined the deferred tax liabilities associated with these undistributed earnings as such determination is not practicable if vf decided to remit those earnings to the us in a future period the provision for income taxes could increase in that period 

cautionary statement on forwardlooking statements

directtoconsumer operations 

our directtoconsumer business includes fullprice stores outlet stores and ecommerce directtoconsumer revenues accounted for 22 of vf’s consolidated total revenues in 2013 compared with 21 in 2012 

our full price stores allow us to showcase a brand’s full line of products with fixtures and imagery that support the brand’s positioning and promise to consumers these stores provide high visibility for our brands and products and enable us to stay close to the needs and preferences of our consumers the proper presentation of products in our stores particularly in our showcase stores also helps to increase sellthrough of vf products at our wholesale customers vfoperated full price stores generally provide margins and return on investment that are well above vf averages in addition vf operates outlet stores in both premium outlet malls and more traditional valuebased locations these outlet stores serve an important role in our overall inventory management and profitability by allowing vf to sell a significant portion of excess discontinued and outofseason products at better prices than are otherwise available from outside parties while maintaining the integrity of our brands 

our growing global retail operations include 1246 stores at the end of 2013 of that total there are 1166 single brand stores ie primarily one brand’s product offerings in each store that sell vans ®  timberland ®  the north face ®  nautica ®  7 for all mankind ®  lee ®  wrangler ®  lucy ®  kipling ®  splendid ®  napapijri ® and ella moss ® brand products we also operate 80 vf outlet ® stores in the us that sell a broad selection of excess quantities of vfbranded products as well as women’s intimate apparel children’s wear other apparel and accessories approximately 70 of vfoperated stores offer products at full price and the remainder are outlet locations approximately 60 of our stores are located in the us and the remaining 40 are located in europe asia latin america mexico and canada 

ecommerce is our fastest growing directtoconsumer channel and represents approximately 13 of our directtoconsumer business we currently market the north face ®  vans ®  timberland ®  7 for all mankind ®  kipling ®  smartwool ®  lee ®  wrangler ®  lucy ®  nautica ®  splendid ®  ella moss ®  jansport ®  reef ®  and eagle creek ® products online in the us plus the north face ®  vans ®  timberland ®  7 for all mankind ®  kipling ®  napapijri ®  eastpak ® and other brands internationally we are continuing to expand our ecommerce initiatives by rolling out additional brand sites in europe and asia and enhancing each brand’s site to deliver a superior consumer experience 

we expect our directtoconsumer business to continue to grow at a faster pace than vf’s overall growth rate as we continue to drive comparable store sales open new stores and expand our ecommerce presence we opened 164 stores during 2013 and we are planning to open approximately 150 additional locations in 2014 concentrated in the brands where we see higher retail growth potential — vans ®  the north face ®  timberland ® and splendid ®  

in addition to our directtoconsumer operations our licensees distributors and other independent parties own and operate over 3000 partnership stores these are primarily monobrand stores selling vfbranded 

  

products and have the appearance of vfoperated stores most of these partnership stores are located in europe and asia and are concentrated in the north face ®  vans ®  timberland ®  kipling ®  nautica ®  napapijri ®  lee ® and wrangler ® brands 

licensing arrangements 

as part of our business strategy of expanding market penetration of vfowned brands we enter into licensing agreements for specific apparel and complementary product categories when such arrangements with independent parties provide more effective manufacturing distribution and marketing of such products than could be achieved internally we provide support to these business partners and ensure the integrity of our brand names by taking an active role in the design quality control advertising marketing and distribution of licensed products 

licensing arrangements relate to a broad range of vf brands license agreements are for fixed terms of generally three to five years with conditional renewal options each licensee pays royalties to vf based on its sales of licensed products with most agreements providing for a minimum royalty requirement royalties generally range from 4 to 10 of the licensing partners’ net licensed products sales royalty income was 1173 million in 2013 1 of total revenues primarily from the nautica ®  vans ®  timberland ®  lee ® and wrangler ® brands in addition licensees of our brands are generally required to spend from 1 to 5 of their net licensed product sales to advertise vf’s products in some cases these advertising amounts are remitted to vf for advertising on behalf of the licensees 

vf has also entered into license agreements to use trademarks owned by third parties we market apparel under licenses granted by major league baseball the national football league the national basketball association the national hockey league harleydavidson motor company inc major colleges and universities and individual athletes and related organizations most of which contain minimum annual royalty and advertising requirements 

manufacturing sourcing and distribution 

product design and innovation including fit fabric finish and quality are important elements across all of our businesses these functions are performed by employees located in our global supply chain organization and our branded business units across the globe 

vf’s centralized global supply chain organization is responsible for sourcing and delivering products to our customers vf is highly skilled in managing the complexities associated with our global supply chain on an annual basis vf sources or produces approximately 500 million units spread across 35 brands vf operates 28 manufacturing facilities and utilizes approximately 1800 contractor manufacturing facilities in 60 countries we operate 29 distribution centers and 1246 retail stores managing this complexity is made possible by the use of a network of information systems for product development forecasting order management and warehouse management attached to our core enterprise resource management platforms 

in 2013 27 of our units were manufactured in vfoperated facilities and 73 were obtained from independent contractors primarily in asia products manufactured in vf facilities generally have a lower cost and shorter lead times than contracted production products obtained from contractors in the western hemisphere generally have a higher cost than products obtained from contractors in asia however contracting in the western hemisphere gives us greater flexibility shorter lead times and allows for lower inventory levels this combination of vfowned and contracted production along with different geographic regions and cost structures provides a wellbalanced approach to product sourcing we will continue to manage our supply chain from a global perspective and adjust as needed to changes in the global production environment 

  

vf operates manufacturing facilities in the us mexico central and south america the caribbean europe and the middle east a significant percentage of denim bottoms and occupational apparel are manufactured in these plants as well as a smaller percentage of footwear for these owned production facilities we purchase raw materials from numerous domestic and international suppliers to meet our production needs raw materials include products made from cotton leather rubber wool synthetics and blends of cotton and synthetic yarn as well as thread and trim product identification buttons zippers snaps eyelets and laces in some instances we contract the sewing of vfowned raw materials into finished product with independent contractors manufacturing in the us includes all major league baseball uniforms along with screen printing and embroidery of jerseys tshirts and fleece products fixed price commitments for fabric and certain supplies are generally set on a quarterly basis for the next quarter’s purchases no single supplier represents more than 5 of our total cost of sales 

independent contractors generally own the raw materials and ship finished readyforsale products to vf these contractors are engaged through vf sourcing hubs in hong kong with satellite offices across asia and panama these hubs are responsible for coordinating the manufacturing and procurement of product supplier management product quality assurance and transportation and shipping functions in the eastern and western hemispheres respectively substantially all products in the outdoor  action sports and sportswear coalitions as well as a portion of products for our jeanswear and imagewear coalitions are obtained through these sourcing hubs for most products in our contemporary brands coalition we contract the sewing and finishing of vfowned raw materials through a network of independent contractors based in the us 

management continually monitors political risks and developments related to duties tariffs and quotas we limit vf’s sourcing exposure through among other measures i diversifying geographies with a mix of vfoperated and contracted production ii shifting of production among countries and contractors iii sourcing production to merchandise categories where product is readily available and iv sourcing from countries with tariff preference and free trade agreements vf does not directly or indirectly source products from suppliers in countries identified by the state department as state sponsors of terrorism and subject to us economic sanctions and export controls 

all vfoperated production facilities throughout the world as well as all independent contractor facilities that manufacture vfbranded products must comply with vf’s global compliance principles these principles established in 1997 and consistent with international labor standards are a set of strict standards covering legal and ethical business practices workers’ ages work hours health and safety conditions environmental standards and compliance with local laws and regulations in addition our owned factories must also undergo certification by the independent nonprofit organization worldwide responsible accredited production “wrap” which promotes global ethics in manufacturing vf through its contractor monitoring program audits the activities of the independent businesses and contractors that produce vfbranded goods at locations across the globe each of the approximately 1800 independent contractor facilities including those serving our independent licensees must be precertified before producing any vf products this precertification includes passing a factory inspection and signing a vf terms of engagement agreement we maintain an ongoing audit program to ensure compliance with these requirements by using dedicated internal staff and externally contracted firms additional information about vf’s code of business conduct global compliance principles terms of engagement factory compliance guidelines factory audit procedure and environmental compliance guidelines along with a global compliance report is available on the vf website at wwwvfccom 

vf did not experience difficulty in filling its raw material and contracting production needs during 2013 and does not anticipate any difficulty in 2014 we believe that we will be able to remain cost competitive in 2014 due to our scale and significance to our suppliers absent any material changes vf believes it would be able to largely offset any increases in product costs through i the continuing shift in the mix of its business to higher margin brands geographies and channels of distribution ii increases in the prices of its products and iii cost reduction opportunities the loss of any one supplier or contractor would not have a significant adverse effect on our business 

  

product is shipped from our independent suppliers and vfoperated manufacturing facilities to distribution centers in the us and international locations in some instances product is shipped directly to our customers most distribution centers are operated by vf and some support more than one brand a portion of our distribution needs are met by contract distribution centers 

seasonality 

vf’s operating results vary from quartertoquarter throughout the year due to the differing sales patterns of our individual businesses on a quarterly basis consolidated total revenues for 2013 ranged from a low of 19 of full year revenues in the second quarter to a high of 29 in the third quarter while consolidated operating income ranged from a low of 12 in the second quarter to a high of 35 in the third quarter this variation results primarily from the seasonal influences on revenues of our outdoor  action sports coalition where 17 of the coalition’s revenues occurred in the second quarter and 31 in the third quarter of 2013 with changes in our mix of business and the growth of our retail operations historical quarterly revenue and profit trends may not be indicative of future trends we expect the portion of annual revenues and profits occurring in the second half of the year to continue to increase 

working capital requirements vary throughout the year working capital increases during the first half of the year as inventory builds to support peak shipping periods and then moderates during the second half of the year as those inventories are sold and accounts receivable are collected cash provided by operating activities is substantially higher in the second half of the year due to higher net income during that period and reduced working capital requirements particularly during the fourth quarter 

advertising customer support and community outreach 

during 2013 our advertising and promotion expense was 6713 million representing 59 of net sales we advertise in consumer and trade publications on radio and television and through digital initiatives including social media and mobile platforms on the internet we also participate in cooperative advertising on a shared cost basis with major retailers in print media radio and television we sponsor sporting musical and special events as well as athletes and personalities who promote our products we employ marketing sciences to optimize the impact of advertising and promotional spending and to identify the types of spending that provide the greatest return on our marketing investments 

we provide advertising support to our wholesale customers in the form of pointofsale fixtures and signage to enhance the presentation and brand image of our products we also participate in shopinshops and concession arrangements which are separate sales areas dedicated to a specific vf brand within our customers’ stores to help differentiate and enhance the presentation of our products 

we participate in incentive programs with our retailer customers including customer loyalty discounts allowances and cooperative advertising funds we also offer sales incentive programs directly to consumers in the form of rebate and coupon offers 

in addition to sponsorships and activities that directly benefit our products and brands vf and its associates actively support our communities and various charities for example the north face ® brand has committed to programs that encourage and enable outdoor participation such as the planet explore ® wwwplanetexplorecom the the north face endurance challenge ® and the explore your parks tm programs the timberland ® brand has a heritage of volunteerism including the path of service ™ program that offers fulltime employees up to 40 hours of paid time off a year to serve their local communities the timberland ® brand also sponsors two annual global service events earth day in the spring and servapalooza in the fall when employees provide assistance to local communities through various volunteer efforts the nautica ® brand supports oceana a notforprofit organization focused on ocean conservatism and charity water a notforprofit organization focused on providing clean safe water to people in need in addition 2013 marked the eighteenth year of support for the lee national denim day ® event one of the 

  

country’s largest singleday fundraisers for breast cancer that has raised over 89 million since its inception to fight breast cancer vf also supports companywide sustainability efforts and recognizes the “vf 100” to honor the 100 vf associates worldwide having the highest number of volunteer service hours during the year 

other matters 

competitive factors 

our business depends on our ability to stimulate consumer demand for vf’s brands and products vf is wellpositioned to compete in the apparel and footwear industries by developing high quality innovative products at competitive prices that meet consumer needs providing high service levels ensuring the right products are on the retail sales floor to meet consumer demand investing significant amounts behind existing brands and continuing to evaluate the potential for acquiring additional brands we continually strive to improve in each of these areas many of vf’s brands have long histories and enjoy strong recognition within their respective consumer segments 

intellectual property 

trademarks patents and domain names as well as related logos designs and graphics provide substantial value in the development and marketing of vf’s products and are important to our continued success we have registered this intellectual property in the us and in other countries where our products are manufactured andor sold we vigorously monitor and enforce vf’s intellectual property against counterfeiting infringement and violations of other rights where and to the extent legal feasible and appropriate in addition we grant licenses to other parties to manufacture and sell products utilizing our intellectual property in product categories and geographic areas in which vf does not operate 

customers 

vf products are primarily sold on a wholesale basis to specialty stores department stores national chains and mass merchants in addition we sell products on a directtoconsumer basis through vfoperated stores and ecommerce sites which accounted for 22 of our total revenues in 2013 our sales in international markets are growing and represented 38 of our total revenues in 2013 the majority of which were in europe 

sales to vf’s ten largest customers all of which are retailers based in the us amounted to 21 of total revenues in 2013 21 in 2012 and 23 in 2011 sales to the five largest customers amounted to approximately 16 of total revenues in 2013 16 in 2012 and 18 in 2011 sales to vf’s largest customer totaled 8 of total revenues in 2013 8 in 2012 and 9 in 2011 the majority of which were in the jeanswear coalition 

employees 

vf had approximately 59000 employees at the end of 2013 of which approximately 26000 were located in the us approximately 630 employees in the us are covered by collective bargaining agreements in international markets a significant percentage of employees are covered by tradesponsored or governmental bargaining arrangements employee relations are considered to be good 

backlog 

the dollar amount of vf’s order backlog as of any date is not meaningful may not be indicative of actual future shipments and accordingly is not material for an understanding of the business of vf taken as a whole

 item 1a risk factors 

the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating vf’s business and the forwardlooking statements contained in this form 10k any of the following risks could materially adversely affect vf’s business its operating results and its financial condition 

vf’s revenues and profits depend on the level of consumer spending for apparel which is sensitive to general economic conditions and other factors a return to recessionary conditions or a decline in consumer spending could have a material adverse effect on vf 

the apparel industry has historically been subject to cyclical variations and is particularly affected by adverse trends in the general economy the success of vf’s business depends on consumer spending and there are a number of factors that influence consumer spending including actual and perceived economic conditions disposable consumer income interest rates consumer credit availability unemployment stock market performance extreme weather conditions energy prices and tax rates in the international national regional and local markets where vf’s products are sold a decline in actual or perceived economic conditions or other factors could negatively impact the level of consumer spending and have a material adverse impact on vf 

fluctuations in the price availability and quality of raw materials and finished goods could increase costs 

fluctuations in the price availability and quality of fabrics leather or other raw materials used by vf in its manufactured products or of purchased finished goods could have a material adverse effect on vf’s cost of sales or its ability to meet its customers’ demands the prices we pay depend on demand and market prices for the raw materials used to produce them the price and availability of such raw materials may fluctuate significantly depending on many factors including general economic conditions and demand crop yields energy prices weather patterns and speculation in the commodities markets prices of purchased finished products also depend on wage rates in asia and other geographic areas where our independent contractors are located as well as freight costs from those regions in the future vf may not be able to offset cost increases with other cost reductions or efficiencies or to pass higher costs on to its customers this could have a material adverse effect on vf’s results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

we may be adversely affected by weather conditions 

our business is adversely affected by unseasonable weather conditions a significant portion of the sales of our products is dependent in part on the weather and is likely to decline in years in which weather conditions do not favor the use of these products periods of unseasonably warm weather in the fall or winter may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows inventory accumulation by 

  

our wholesale customers resulting from unseasonable weather in one season generally negatively affects orders in future seasons which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows abnormally harsh or inclement weather can also negatively impact retail traffic and consumer spending 

the apparel and footwear industries are highly competitive and vf’s success depends on its ability to respond to constantly changing markets 

vf competes with numerous apparel and footwear brands and manufacturers competition is generally based upon brand name recognition price design product quality selection service and purchasing convenience some of our competitors are larger and have more resources than vf in some product categories and regions in addition vf competes directly with the private label brands of most of its wholesale customers vf’s ability to compete within the apparel and footwear industries depends on our ability to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 failure to compete effectively or to keep pace with rapidly changing markets and trends could have a material adverse effect on vf’s business financial condition and results of operations 

vf’s results of operations could be materially harmed if we are unable to gauge consumer preferences and product trends and accurately forecast demand for our products 

our success depends in part on management’s ability to effectively anticipate and respond to changing consumer preferences and product trends and to translate trends into marketable product offerings in advance of the actual time of sale to the customer even if we are successful in anticipating consumer demands we must continue to be able to develop and introduce innovative highquality products in order to sustain consumer demand 

we often schedule internal production and place orders for products with independent manufacturers before our customers’ orders are firm factors that could affect our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products include 

 

  

  

  

  

   

there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully anticipate changing consumer preferences and product trends or economic conditions and as a result we may not successfully manage inventory levels to meet our future order requirements if we fail to accurately forecast consumer demand we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of product required to meet the demand inventory levels in excess of consumer demand may result in inventory writedowns and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices which could have an adverse effect on the image and reputation of vf’s brands and negatively impact profitability on the other hand if we underestimate demand for our products our manufacturing facilities or third party manufacturers may not be able to produce products to meet consumer requirements and this could result in delays in the shipment of products and lost revenues as well as damage to vf’s reputation and relationships these risks could have a material adverse effect on our brand image as well as our results of operations and financial condition 

vf’s business and the success of its products could be harmed if vf is unable to maintain the images of its brands 

vf’s success to date has been due in large part to the growth of its brands’ images and vf’s customers’ connection to its brands if we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to changing consumer demand the names and images of our brands may be impaired even if we react appropriately to changes in consumer preferences consumers may consider our brands’ images to be outdated or associate our brands with styles that are no longer popular in addition brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of qualities including merchandise quality and corporate integrity negative claims or publicity regarding vf its brands or its products including licensed products could adversely affect our reputation and sales regardless of whether such claims are accurate social media which accelerates the dissemination of information can increase the challenges of responding to negative claims in the past many apparel companies have experienced periods of rapid growth in sales and earnings followed by periods of declining sales and losses our businesses may be similarly affected in the future in addition we have sponsorship contracts with a number of athletes and musicians and feature those individuals in our advertising and marketing efforts actions taken by those individuals associated with our products could harm their reputations and adversely affect the images of our brands 

vf relies significantly on information technology any inadequacy interruption integration failure or security failure of this technology could harm vf’s ability to effectively operate its business 

our ability to effectively manage and operate our business depends significantly on information technology systems the failure of these systems to operate effectively problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems difficulty in integrating new systems or systems of acquired businesses or a breach in security of these systems could adversely impact the operations of vf’s business including corporate email communications ecommerce operations retail business credit card transaction authorization and processing and our interaction with the public on social media 

in the normal course of business we often collect retain and transmit certain sensitive and confidential customer information including credit card information over public networks there is a significant concern by consumers and employees over the security of personal information transmitted over the internet consumer identity theft and user privacy despite the security measures we currently have in place our facilities and systems and those of our third party service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches and vf and its customers could suffer harm if customer information were accessed by third parties due to a security failure in vf’s systems it could require significant expenditures to remediate any such failure problem or breach and severely damage our reputation and our relationships with customers 

  

a substantial portion of vf’s revenues and gross profit is derived from a small number of large customers the loss of any of these customers or the inability of any of these customers to pay vf could substantially reduce vf’s revenues and profits 

a few of vf’s customers account for a significant portion of revenues sales to vf’s ten largest customers were 21 of total revenues in fiscal 2013 with our largest customer accounting for 8 of revenues sales to our customers are generally on a purchase order basis and not subject to longterm agreements a decision by any of vf’s major customers to significantly decrease the volume of products purchased from vf could substantially reduce revenues and have a material adverse effect on vf’s financial condition and results of operations moreover in recent years the retail industry has experienced consolidation and other ownership changes in the future retailers may further consolidate undergo restructurings or reorganizations realign their affiliations or reposition their stores’ target markets these developments could result in a reduction in the number of stores that carry vf’s products an increase in ownership concentration within the retail industry an increase in credit exposure to vf or an increase in leverage by vf’s customers over their suppliers these changes could impact vf’s opportunities in the market and increase vf’s reliance on a smaller number of large customers 

further the global economy periodically experiences recessionary conditions with rising unemployment reduced availability of credit increased savings rates and declines in real estate and securities values these recessionary conditions could have a negative impact on retail sales of apparel and other consumer products the lower sales volumes along with the possibility of restrictions on access to the credit markets could result in our customers experiencing financial difficulties including store closures bankruptcies or liquidations this could result in higher credit risk to vf relating to receivables from our customers who are experiencing these financial difficulties if these developments occur our inability to shift sales to other customers or to collect on vf’s trade accounts receivable could have a material adverse effect on vf’s financial condition and results of operations 

vf’s profitability may decline as a result of increasing pressure on margins 

the apparel industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors including intense competition consolidation in the retail industry pressure from retailers to reduce the costs of products and changes in consumer demand if these factors cause us to reduce our sales prices to retailers and consumers and we fail to sufficiently reduce our product costs or operating expenses vf’s profitability will decline this could have a material adverse effect on vf’s results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

vf may not succeed in its growth strategy 

one of vf’s key strategic objectives is growth we seek to grow organically and through acquisitions we seek to grow by building new lifestyle brands expanding our share with winning customers stretching vf’s brands to new regions managing costs leveraging our supply chain and information technology capabilities across vf and expanding our directtoconsumer business including opening new stores and remodeling and expanding our existing stores we may not be able to grow our existing businesses we may have difficulty completing acquisitions and we may not be able to successfully integrate a newly acquired business or achieve the expected growth cost savings or synergies from such integration we may not be able to expand our market share with winning customers expand our brands geographically or achieve the expected results from our supply chain initiatives we may have difficulty recruiting developing or retaining qualified employees we may not be able to achieve our store expansion goals manage our growth effectively successfully integrate the planned new stores into our operations or operate our new remodeled and expanded stores profitably failure to implement our growth strategy may have a material adverse effect on vf’s business 

there are risks associated with vf’s acquisitions 

any acquisitions or mergers by vf will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of companies these risks include among other things higher than anticipated acquisition costs and expenses 

  

the difficulty and expense of integrating the operations systems and personnel of the companies and the loss of key employees and customers as a result of changes in management in addition geographic distances may make integration of acquired businesses more difficult we may not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with any acquisitions 

our acquisitions may cause large onetime expenses or create goodwill or other intangible assets that could result in significant impairment charges in the future we also make certain estimates and assumptions in order to determine purchase price allocation and estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed if our estimates or assumptions used to value these assets and liabilities are not accurate we may be exposed to losses that may be material 

vf’s operations in international markets and earnings in those markets may be affected by legal regulatory political and economic risks 

our ability to maintain the current level of operations in our existing international markets and to capitalize on growth in existing and new international markets is subject to risks associated with international operations these include the burdens of complying with foreign laws and regulations unexpected changes in regulatory requirements tariffs or other barriers in some international markets 

we cannot predict whether quotas duties taxes exchange controls or other restrictions will be imposed by the us the european union or other countries on the import or export of our products or what effect any of these actions would have on vf’s business financial condition or results of operations we cannot predict whether there might be changes in our ability to repatriate earnings or capital from international jurisdictions changes in regulatory geopolitical policies and other factors may adversely affect vf’s business or may require us to modify our current business practices 

approximately 60 of vf’s 2013 net income was earned in jurisdictions outside the us vf is exposed to risks of changes in us policy for companies having business operations outside the us there have been a number of proposed changes to us income tax laws including overall corporate and individual tax reform some of these tax law changes and tax reform proposals among other things consider accelerating the us taxability of nonus earnings or limiting foreign tax credits while enactment of any such proposal is not certain if new legislation were enacted it is possible our us income tax expense could increase which would reduce our earnings 

we may have additional tax liabilities 

as a global company we determine our income tax liability in various tax jurisdictions based on an analysis and interpretation of local tax laws and regulations this analysis requires a significant amount of judgment and estimation and is often based on various assumptions about the future actions of the local tax authorities these determinations are the subject of periodic domestic and foreign tax audits although we accrue for uncertain tax positions our accrual may be insufficient to satisfy unfavorable findings unfavorable audit findings and tax rulings may result in payment of taxes fines and penalties for prior periods and higher tax rates in future periods which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows further in an effort to deal with budget deficits governments around the world are focusing on increasing tax revenues through increased audits and potentially increased tax rates for corporations changes in tax law or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly affect the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 

  

vf uses third party suppliers and manufacturing facilities worldwide for a substantial portion of its raw materials and finished products which poses risks to vf’s business operations 

during fiscal 2013 approximately 73 of vf’s units were purchased from independent manufacturers primarily located in asia with substantially all of the remainder produced by vfowned and operated manufacturing facilities located in the us mexico central and south america the caribbean europe and the middle east any of the following could impact our ability to produce or deliver vf products 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 although no single supplier and no one country is critical to vf’s production needs if we were to lose a supplier it could result in interruption of finished goods shipments to vf cancellation of orders by customers and termination of relationships this along with the damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on vf’s revenues and consequently our results of operations 

our business is subject to national state and local laws and regulations for environmental employment safety and other matters the costs of compliance with or the violation of such laws and regulations by vf or by independent suppliers who manufacture products for vf could have an adverse effect on our operations and cash flows as well as on our reputation 

our business is subject to comprehensive federal state and local laws and regulations on a wide range of environmental employment safety and other matters vf could be adversely affected by costs of compliance with or violations of those laws and regulations in addition while we do not control their business practices we require third party suppliers to operate in compliance with applicable laws rules and regulations regarding working conditions employment practices and environmental compliance the costs of products purchased by vf from independent contractors could increase due to the costs of compliance by those contractors 

failure by vf or its third party suppliers to comply with such laws and regulations as well as with ethical social product labor and environmental standards or related political considerations could result in interruption 

  

of finished goods shipments to vf cancellation of orders by customers and termination of relationships if one of our independent contractors violates labor or other laws or implements labor or other business practices that are generally regarded as unethical it could jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions including boycotts that may reduce demand for vf’s merchandise damage to vf’s reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on vf’s results of operations financial condition and cash flows as well as require additional resources to rebuild vf’s reputation 

vf’s business is exposed to the risks of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations vf’s hedging strategies may not be effective in mitigating those risks 

a growing percentage of vf’s total revenues approximately 38 in 2013 is derived from markets outside the us vf’s international businesses operate in functional currencies other than the us dollar changes in currency exchange rates may affect the us dollar value of the foreign currencydenominated amounts at which vf’s international businesses purchase products incur costs or sell products in addition for vf’s usbased businesses the majority of products are sourced from independent contractors or vf plants located in foreign countries as a result the cost of these products may be affected by changes in the value of the relevant currencies furthermore much of vf’s licensing revenue is derived from sales in foreign currencies changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse impact on vf’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in accordance with our operating practices we hedge a significant portion of our foreign currency transaction exposures arising in the ordinary course of business to reduce risks in our cash flows and earnings our hedging strategy may not be effective in reducing all risks and no hedging strategy can completely insulate vf from foreign exchange risk we do not hedge foreign currency translation rate changes 

further our use of derivative financial instruments may expose vf to counterparty risks although vf only enters into hedging contracts with counterparties having investment grade credit ratings it is possible that the credit quality of a counterparty could be downgraded or a counterparty could default on its obligations which could have a material adverse impact on vf’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

vf borrows funds on a shortterm basis primarily to support seasonal working capital requirements longterm debt is part of vf’s total capital structure because of conditions in global credit markets vf may have difficulty accessing capital markets for short or longterm financing 

particularly in 2008 and continuing to a lesser extent during the last five years global capital and credit markets have experienced extreme volatility and disruption with government intervention mergers or bankruptcies of several major financial institutions and a general decline in global liquidity many corporate issuers have been unable to access credit markets 

we typically use shortterm commercial paper borrowings to support seasonal working capital requirements with amounts generally repaid by the end of each year from strong cash flows from operations vf has been able to borrow in the commercial paper markets in recent years in the future vf may seek to access the longterm capital markets to replace maturing debt obligations or to fund acquisitions or other growth opportunities there is no assurance that the commercial paper markets or the longterm capital markets will continue to be reliable sources of financing for vf if vf does not have access to financing it could have a material adverse impact on vf’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

vf has a global revolving credit facility one or more of the participating banks may not be able to honor their commitments which could have an adverse effect on vf’s business 

vf has a 125 billion global revolving credit facility that expires in december 2016 if the financial 

  

markets return to recessionary conditions this could impair the ability of one or more of the banks participating in our credit agreements from honoring their commitments this could have an adverse effect on our business if we were not able to replace those commitments or to locate other sources of liquidity on acceptable terms 

the loss of members of vf’s executive management and other key employees could have a material adverse effect on its business 

vf depends on the services and management experience of its executive officers and business leaders who have substantial experience and expertise in vf’s business vf also depends on other key employees involved in the operation of its business competition for experienced and wellqualified personnel is intense the unexpected loss of services of one or more of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on vf 

vf’s directtoconsumer business includes risks that could have an adverse effect on its results 

vf sells merchandise directtoconsumer through vfoperated stores and over the internet through its websites its directtoconsumer business is subject to numerous risks that could have a material adverse effect on its results risks include but are not limited to a domestic or international resellers purchasing merchandise and reselling it overseas outside vf’s control b failure of the systems that operate the stores and websites and their related support systems including computer viruses theft of customer information privacy concerns telecommunication failures and electronic breakins and similar disruptions c credit card fraud and d risks related to vf’s directtoconsumer distribution centers risks specific to vf’s ecommerce business also include a diversion of sales from vf stores or wholesale customers b difficulty in recreating the instore experience through direct channels and c liability for online content vf’s failure to successfully respond to these risks might adversely affect sales in its internet business as well as damage its reputation and brands 

our vfoperated stores and ecommerce business requires substantial fixed investment in equipment and leasehold improvements information systems inventory and personnel we have entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space due to the high fixedcost structure associated with our directtoconsumer operations a decline in sales or the closure of or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs writeoffs of equipment and leasehold improvements and employeerelated costs 

vf’s net sales depend on a volume of traffic to its stores and the availability of suitable lease space 

a growing portion of our revenues are directtoconsumer sales through vfoperated stores in order to generate customer traffic we locate many of our stores in prominent locations within successful retail shopping centers or in fashionable shopping districts our stores benefit from the ability of the retail center and other attractions in an area to generate consumer traffic in the vicinity of our stores part of our future growth is significantly dependent on our ability to operate stores in desirable locations with capital investment and lease costs providing the opportunity to earn a reasonable return we cannot control the development of new shopping centers or districts the availability or cost of appropriate locations within existing or new shopping centers or districts competition with other retailers for prominent locations or the success of individual shopping centers or districts further if we are unable to renew or replace our existing store leases or enter into leases for new stores on favorable terms or if we violate the terms of our current leases our growth and profitability could be harmed all of these factors may impact our ability to meet our growth targets and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

vf may be unable to protect its trademarks and other intellectual property rights 

vf’s trademarks and other intellectual property rights are important to its success and its competitive position vf is susceptible to others copying its products and infringing its intellectual property rights especially with the shift in product mix to higher priced brands and innovative new products in recent years some of vf’s 

  

brands such as the north face ®  timberland ®  vans ®  jansport ®  nautica ®  wrangler ® and lee ®  enjoy significant worldwide consumer recognition and the higher pricing of those products creates additional risk of counterfeiting and infringement 

vf’s trademarks trade names patents trade secrets and other intellectual property are important to vf’s success counterfeiting of vf’s products or infringement on its intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our brands and adversely affect vf’s revenues actions we have taken to establish and protect vf’s intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent copying of its products by others or to prevent others from seeking to invalidate its trademarks or block sales of vf’s products as a violation of the trademarks and intellectual property rights of others in addition unilateral actions in the us or other countries including changes to or the repeal of laws recognizing trademark or other intellectual property rights could have an impact on vf’s ability to enforce those rights 

the value of vf’s intellectual property could diminish if others assert rights in or ownership of trademarks and other intellectual property rights of vf or trademarks that are similar to vf’s trademarks or trademarks that vf licenses from others we may be unable to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction in some cases there may be trademark owners who have prior rights to vf’s trademarks because the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the us in other cases there may be holders who have prior rights to similar trademarks vf is from time to time involved in opposition and cancellation proceedings with respect to some of its intellectual property rights 

we may be subject to liability if third parties successfully claim that we infringe on their trademarks copyrights patents or other intellectual property rights defending infringement claims could be expensive and timeconsuming and might result in our entering into costly license agreements 

vf is subject to the risk that its licensees may not generate expected sales or maintain the value of vf’s brands 

during 2013 1173 million of vf’s revenues were derived from licensing royalties although vf generally has significant control over its licensees’ products and advertising we rely on our licensees for among other things operational and financial controls over their businesses failure of our licensees to successfully market licensed products or our inability to replace existing licensees if necessary could adversely affect vf’s revenues both directly from reduced royalties received and indirectly from reduced sales of our other products risks are also associated with a licensee’s ability to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition vf relies on its licensees to help preserve the value of its brands although we attempt to protect vf’s brands through approval rights over design production processes quality packaging merchandising distribution advertising and promotion of our licensed products we cannot completely control the use of licensed vf brands by our licensees the misuse of a brand by a licensee could have a material adverse effect on that brand and on vf 

  

vf has entered into license agreements to use the trademarks of others loss of a license could have an adverse effect on vf’s operating results 

vf has entered into agreements to market products under licenses granted by third parties including major league baseball the national football league and harleydavidson motor company inc some of these licenses are for a short term and do not contain renewal options loss of a license which in certain cases could result in an impairment charge for related operating and intangible assets could have an adverse effect on vf’s operating results 

if vf encounters problems with its distribution system vf’s ability to deliver its products to the market could be adversely affected 

vf relies on owned or independentlyoperated distribution facilities to warehouse and ship product to its customers vf’s distribution system includes computercontrolled and automated equipment which may be subject to a number of risks related to security or computer viruses the proper operation of software and hardware power interruptions or other system failures because substantially all of vf’s products are distributed from a relatively small number of locations vf’s operations could also be interrupted by earthquakes floods fires or other natural disasters affecting its distribution centers we maintain business interruption insurance but it may not adequately protect vf from the adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in vf’s distribution facilities such as the longterm loss of customers or an erosion of brand image in addition vf’s distribution capacity is dependent on the timely performance of services by third parties including the transportation of product to and from its distribution facilities if we encounter problems with our distribution system our ability to meet customer expectations manage inventory complete sales and achieve operating efficiencies could be materially adversely affected 

vf’s balance sheet includes a significant amount of intangible assets and goodwill a decline in the fair value of an intangible asset or of a business unit could result in an asset impairment charge which would be recorded as an operating expense in vf’s consolidated statement of income and could be material 

we evaluate goodwill and nonamortizing trademark and trade name intangible assets for possible impairment at least annually in addition intangible assets that are being amortized are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value might not be recoverable for these impairment tests we use various valuation methods to estimate the fair value of our business units and intangible assets if the fair value of an asset is less than its carrying value we would recognize an impairment charge for the difference 

it is possible that we could have an impairment charge for goodwill or trademark and trade name intangible assets in future periods if i overall economic conditions in 2014 or future years vary from our current assumptions ii business conditions or our strategies for a specific business unit change from our current assumptions iii investors require higher rates of return on equity investments in the marketplace or iv enterprise values of comparable publicly traded companies or of actual sales transactions of comparable companies were to decline resulting in lower comparable multiples of revenues and ebitda and accordingly lower implied values of goodwill and intangible assets a future impairment charge for goodwill or intangible assets could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

volatility in securities markets interest rates and other economic factors could substantially increase vf’s defined benefit pension costs 

vf currently has unfunded obligations under its defined benefit pension plans the funded status of the pension plans is dependent on many factors including returns on investment assets and the discount rate used to determine pension obligations unfavorable returns on plan assets a lower discount rate or unfavorable changes in the applicable laws or regulations could materially change the timing and amount of pension funding requirements which could reduce cash available for vf’s business 

  

vf’s operating performance also may be negatively impacted by the amount of expense recorded for its pension plans pension expense is calculated using actuarial valuations that incorporate assumptions and estimates about financial market economic and demographic conditions differences between estimated and actual results give rise to gains and losses that are deferred and amortized as part of future pension expense which can create volatility that adversely impacts vf’s future operating results

analysis of results of operations 

consolidated statements of income 

the following table presents a summary of the changes in total revenues during the last two years 

 

 vf reported revenue growth of 5 in 2013 driven by an increase in unit volume with particular strength in the outdoor  action sports and sportswear coalitions our international and directtoconsumer businesses continued to expand growing revenues by 8 and 13 respectively the increase in 2012 revenues compared with 2011 is primarily due to the outdoor  action sports coalition driven by the acquisition of the timberland company “timberland” and organic growth additional details on revenues are provided in the section titled “information by business segment” 

vf’s foreign currency exposure primarily relates to businesses conducted in eurobased countries the weighted average translation rates for the euro were 133 128 and 139 per euro for 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively in addition vf has foreign currency exposure related to businesses in developed and emerging markets around the world changes in foreign currency translation rates for all currencies positively impacted revenue comparisons by 458 million in 2013 and negatively impacted revenue comparisons by 1698 million in 2012 

the following table presents the percentage relationship to total revenues for components of the consolidated statements of income 

 

 gross margin increased 160 basis points to 481 in 2013 compared with 465 in 2012 with improvements in nearly every coalition the increase in gross margin reflects lower product costs and the continued shift in the revenue mix towards higher margin businesses including outdoor  action sports international and directtoconsumer 

gross margin increased 70 basis points to 465 in 2012 compared with 458 in 2011 this increase in gross margin was driven by the continued shift in the revenue mix towards higher margin businesses partially offset by benefits in 2011 that did not recur in 2012 related to a gain on a facility closure and change in inventory accounting policy 

selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues were 50 basis points higher in 2013 compared with 2012 due to additional marketing and directtoconsumer investments to support future growth for our largest and fastest growing businesses partially offset by the leverage of operating expenses on higher revenues and lower acquisitionrelated expenses for timberland 

  

selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues were higher in 2012 compared with 2011 due to the inclusion of a full year of timberland which has higher expense ratios than other vf businesses as well as increases in pension and marketing expenses these increases were partially offset by lower timberland acquisitionrelated expenses in 2012 and the leverage of operating expenses on higher total revenues 

operating margin increased 90 basis points to 144 in 2013 from 135 in 2012 the increase in operating margin for 2013 was due to improved gross margin and the leverage of operating expenses on higher revenues partially offset by increased marketing and directtoconsumer investments in 2013 

operating margin increased 30 basis points to 135 in 2012 from 132 in 2011 timberland negatively impacted 2012 operating margin by 90 basis points including 30 basis points from the impact of acquisitionrelated expenses timberland negatively impacted 2011 operating margin by 40 basis points including 30 basis points from the impact of acquisitionrelated expenses 

net interest expense decreased 96 million to 806 million in 2013 due to i lower average levels of shortterm borrowings ii the repayment of 4000 million of floating rate notes during the third quarter of 2013 and iii increased amounts of interest capitalized for significant projects net interest expense increased 175 million to 903 million in 2012 primarily due to i the issuance of 9000 million of term debt in 2011 to fund the timberland acquisition and ii higher average levels of shortterm borrowings throughout 2012 

outstanding interestbearing debt averaged 19 billion for 2013 25 billion for 2012 and 17 billion for 2011 with shortterm borrowings representing 10 25 and 24 of average debt outstanding for the respective years the weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt was 45 for 2013 37 for 2012 and 45 for 2011 the weighted average interest rate increased in 2013 primarily due to i lower average levels of shortterm borrowings which have lower interest rates than the average of all outstanding debt and ii fewer months outstanding of the 4000 million floating rate debt which had a lower interest rate than the average of all outstanding debt and was repaid during the year the decrease in the weighted average interest rate in 2012 from 2011 resulted from the full year inclusion of the lower average interest rates on the 9000 million term debt noted above 

other income expense netted to expense of 40 million in 2013 compared with income of 469 million in 2012 the expense in 2013 was primarily due to foreign currency exchange losses the income in 2012 was primarily due to the 420 million gain on the sale of vf’s 80 ownership in john varvatos enterprises inc “john varvatos” 

other income expense netted to income of 469 million in 2012 compared with expense of 72 million in 2011 the income in 2012 was primarily due to the 420 million gain on the sale of john varvatos and foreign currency exchange gains the expense in 2011 was primarily due to foreign currency exchange losses 

the effective income tax rate for 2013 was 226 which is 10 lower than the effective rate in 2012 the 2013 tax rate included a net 260 million in discrete tax benefits primarily related to the retroactive impact of the american tax relief act of 2012 discussed below 87 million tax benefit prior year refund claims and tax credits 70 million tax benefit unrecognized tax benefits and interest net 59 million tax benefit and changes in valuation allowances for capital and operating loss carryforwards net 34 million tax benefit these discrete items collectively lowered the 2013 annual tax rate by 17 compared with 22 in 2012 without discrete items the effective tax rate during 2013 decreased by approximately 15 primarily due to the 2013 impact of tax law changes in the us related to the american tax relief act of 2012 and a higher percentage of income in lower tax rate jurisdictions compared with 2012 the international effective tax rate was 121 and 136 for 2013 and 2012 respectively 

the effective income tax rate was 236 for both 2012 and 2011 the 2012 effective income tax rate included a net 310 million in discrete tax benefits primarily related to changes in valuation allowances for 

  

capital and operating loss carryforwards net 330 million tax benefit and unrecognized tax benefits and interest net 20 million tax expense these discrete items collectively lowered the 2012 annual tax rate by 22 compared with 14 in 2011 without discrete items the effective tax rate during 2012 increased by approximately 08 primarily due to tax law changes in the us partially offset by a higher percentage of income in lower tax rate jurisdictions compared with 2011 the 2011 income tax rate included a net 163 in discrete tax benefits primarily related to changes in valuation allowances for operating loss carryforwards net 121 million benefit and unrecognized tax benefits and interest net 42 million benefit which together lowered the 2011 annual tax rate by 14 

the american tax relief act of 2012 signed into law in january 2013 retroactively extended certain tax credits and incentives through tax year 2013 the impact of this tax law change to the 2012 tax year was considered a discrete tax benefit when recorded in the first quarter of 2013 the change in tax law also provided tax credits and incentives applicable to the 2013 tax year which were not considered discrete items these tax incentives do not extend beyond 2013 and therefore have been excluded from future tax rates vf expects the 2014 annual tax rate to approximate 235 to 24 

net income attributable to vf corporation in 2013 increased to 12 billion 271 per share compared with 11 billion 243 per share in 2012 the increase in earnings per share in 2013 resulted primarily from improved operating performance as discussed in the “information by business segment” section below as well as the other factors described above in addition earnings per share in 2013 compared with 2012 benefited by 004 per share due to lower timberland acquisitionrelated expenses 

net income attributable to vf corporation in 2012 increased to 11 billion 243 per share compared with 8881 million 200 per share in 2011 the increase in earnings per share in 2012 resulted primarily from improved operating performance as discussed in the “information by business segment” section below as well as the other factors described above in addition earnings per share in 2012 compared with 2011 benefited by a 012 per share incremental contribution from timberland net of acquisitionrelated expenses and an 008 per share gain on the sale of john varvatos 

information by business segment 

management at each of the coalitions has direct control over and responsibility for its revenues and operating income hereinafter termed “coalition revenues” and “coalition profit” respectively vf management evaluates operating performance and makes investment and other decisions based on available opportunities and analysis of coalition revenues and coalition profit common costs such as information systems processing retirement benefits and insurance are allocated to the coalitions based on appropriate metrics such as sales usage or number of employees 

  

the following tables present a summary of the changes in coalition revenues and coalition profit during the last two years 

 

 the following section discusses changes in revenues and profitability by coalition 

outdoor  action sports 

 

 the outdoor  action sports coalition includes the following brands the north face ®  vans ®  timberland ®  kipling ® outside of north america napapijri ®  reef ®  eastpak ®  jansport ®  smartwool ®  lucy ® and eagle creek ®  

  

the outdoor  action sports coalition revenues increased 9 in 2013 over 2012 primarily due to an increase in unit volume the north face ®  vans ®  and timberland ® brands achieved global revenue growth of 7 17 and 5 respectively us revenues increased 7 in 2013 and international revenues increased 10 with balanced growth in europe and asia pacific directtoconsumer revenues rose 15 in 2013 driven by increases of 28 and 15 for the north face ® and vans ® brands respectively new store openings comp store growth and an expanding ecommerce business all contributed to the directtoconsumer revenue growth foreign currency translation positively impacted revenues by 534 million in 2013 

coalition revenues increased 29 in 2012 over 2011 of this increase 10 related to organic growth which is net of a 3 negative impact from foreign currency translation and 19 related to the inclusion of timberland in particular the north face ® and vans ® brands achieved global revenue growth of 9 and 23 respectively foreign currency translation negatively impacted revenues by 1179 million in 2012 

us revenues increased 21 in 2012 with 12 percentage points of the increase coming from the timberland acquisition international revenues rose 37 in 2012 reflecting 11 organic growth net of a 6 negative impact from foreign currency translation and 26 growth due to the inclusion of timberland directtoconsumer revenues rose 37 in 2012 with 23 percentage points of the growth from the timberland acquisition the directtoconsumer businesses of the north face ® and vans ® brands increased 13 and 18 respectively in 2012 new store openings comp store growth and an expanding ecommerce business all contributed to the directtoconsumer revenue growth 

operating margin decreased 10 basis points in 2013 due to additional marketing and directtoconsumer investments for the coalition’s three largest brands the north face ®  vans ® and timberland ®  partially offset by increased leverage of operating expenses on higher revenues 

the decrease in operating margin for 2012 compared with 2011 was primarily due to the inclusion for the full year of timberland which has a lower operating margin than the overall coalition average 

jeanswear 

 

 the jeanswear coalition consists of the global jeanswear businesses led by the wrangler ® and lee ® brands 

global jeanswear revenues increased 1 in 2013 over 2012 driven by 2 growth in the us within the combined mass western specialty and lee ® brand businesses despite continued weakness in the midtier channel and a slowdown in the mass business international jeanswear revenues decreased 1 in 2013 driven by an 8 decrease in asia pacific where the wrangler ® brand in china converted from direct wholesale to a licensing model and the lee ® brand in china was impacted by an industrywide inventory buildup that began during the latter part of 2012 partially offsetting the decrease in asia pacific revenues was a 2 increase in jeanswear europe primarily resulting from the benefit of foreign currency translation gains revenues in the americas nonus region were about flat in 2013 compared with 2012 

global jeanswear revenues increased 2 in 2012 over 2011 led by 5 revenue growth in the us business the increase in us revenues was primarily due to growth in the mass and western specialty businesses as well as in our newest brand rock  republic ®  offsetting a decline in the lee ® brand revenues due to continued 

  

softness in the midtier channel in the us international jeanswear revenues decreased by 4 in 2012 due to weak economic conditions in europe and a 2 436 million negative impact from foreign currency translation this decrease was partially offset by revenue increases in asia reflecting strong wholesale growth 

operating margin improved 270 basis points in 2013 over 2012 primarily driven by lower product costs and improvement in international performance 

operating margin improved 160 basis points in 2012 over 2011 primarily driven by lower product costs operating margin in 2011 included a 40 basis point gain on a facility closure 

imagewear 

 

 the imagewear coalition consists of vf’s image business occupational apparel and uniforms including the red kap ® and bulwark ® brand businesses and licensed sports business athletic apparel and fanwear which includes the majestic ® brand business 

coalition revenues decreased 1 in 2013 compared with 2012 primarily due to a longstanding image business customer that shipped throughout 2012 but did not have significant shipments in 2013 until late in the third quarter revenues from the licensed sports business were slightly down in 2013 compared with 2012 as declines in the major league baseball and harley davidson businesses were partially offset by increases in the national football league collegiate and national hockey league businesses 

the increase in coalition revenues for 2012 was primarily attributable to a 6 increase in the image business due to growth in the government and public safety and industrial uniform businesses revenues in the licensed sports business increased 3 in 2012 due to expansion in the harley davidson collegiate and national basketball association businesses 

the 80 basis point improvement in operating margin in 2013 compared with 2012 was driven by improved gross margin due to lower product costs 

the decline in operating margin in 2012 compared with 2011 was primarily due to higher product costs that negatively impacted the business during the first three quarters of 2012 

sportswear 

 

 the sportswear coalition consists of the nautica ® and kipling ® brand businesses in north america the kipling ® brand outside of north america is managed by the outdoor  action sports coalition 

  

coalition revenues increased 8 in 2013 over 2012 primarily due to an increase in unit volume revenues increased in the nautica ® and kipling ® brands by 5 and 29 respectively driven primarily by the directtoconsumer businesses new store openings comp store growth and higher ecommerce revenues contributed to a 19 increase in the coalition’s directto consumer business 

coalition revenues rose 6 in 2012 compared with 2011 reflecting 5 and 17 growth in the nautica ® and kipling ® brands respectively these revenue increases are primarily attributable to doubledigit growth in the directtoconsumer businesses of both brands 

operating margin improved 150 basis points in 2013 over 2012 due to a continuing shift in the business mix toward higher margin directtoconsumer businesses improvements in the profitability of the wholesale and directtoconsumer businesses as well as the leverage of operating expenses on higher revenues 

operating margin increased in 2012 compared with 2011 due to improved performance in both the wholesale and directtoconsumer businesses 

contemporary brands 

 

 the contemporary brands coalition consists of the 7 for all mankind ® brand of premium denim jeanswear and related apparel and the splendid ® and ella moss ® apparel brands the john varvatos ® luxury apparel collection for men was in this coalition until it was sold on april 30 2012 

excluding the impact of the sale of the john varvatos brand in 2012 coalition revenues decreased 2 in 2013 compared with 2012 due to unit volume decreases in the wholesale business partially offset by higher directtoconsumer revenues from new stores and ecommerce revenues for the 7 for all mankind ® brand in the us decreased 6 due to contraction in demand for premium denim in the wholesale business partially offset by higher directtoconsumer revenues revenues for the 7 for all mankind ® brand in europe increased 10 with balanced growth in the wholesale and directtoconsumer businesses splendid ® and ella moss ® brand revenues in the us on a combined basis declined 1 in 2013 compared with 2012 as declines in wholesale were partially offset by an increase in the directtoconsumer business 

adjusting for the sale of john varvatos coalition revenues increased 5 in 2012 compared with 2011 the revenue increase was driven by growth in the splendid ® and ella moss ® brands on a combined basis of 18 us revenues for the 7 for all mankind ® brand increased 4 in 2012 revenues for the 7 for all mankind ® brand in europe decreased 6 net of an 8 negative impact from foreign currency translation this 2 net increase is due to growth in the directtoconsumer businesses revenues from the directtoconsumer businesses in this coalition adjusted for the sale of john varvatos expanded by 15 in 2012 due to new stores comp store revenue growth and higher ecommerce revenues 

operating margin decreased in 2013 compared with 2012 primarily due to lower cost absorption resulting from a decline in sales volume as well as increased investments in marketing and the directtoconsumer businesses 

operating margin increased in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to a reduction in the sales of excess inventories which are lower in profitability for the 7 for all mankind ® brand and a greater percentage of revenues from the higher margin directtoconsumer businesses 

  

other 

 

 vf outlet ® stores in the us sell vf as well as other branded products at prices that are generally higher than what could be realized through external wholesale channels revenues and profits of vf products sold in these stores are reported as part of the operating results of the applicable coalition while revenues and profits of nonvf products are reported in the “other” category 

reconciliation of coalition profit to consolidated income before income taxes 

there are two types of costs necessary to reconcile total coalition profit to consolidated income before income taxes these costs are i interest expense net which is excluded from coalition profit because substantially all financing costs are managed at the corporate office and are not under the control of coalition management and ii corporate and other expenses which are excluded from coalition profit to the extent they are not allocated to the operating coalitions these expenses are summarized as follows 

 

 information systems and shared services 

these costs include management information systems and the centralized finance supply chain human resources directtoconsumer and customer management functions that support worldwide operations operating costs of information systems and shared services are charged to the coalitions based on utilization of those services costs to develop new computer applications are generally not allocated to the coalitions the increase in information systems and shared services costs in 2013 and 2012 resulted from the overall growth of the businesses and costs associated with expanded software implementations and upgrades information systems and shared services costs in 2012 also included increased information systems spending related to the integration of timberland 

corporate headquarters’ costs 

headquarters’ costs include compensation and benefits of corporate management and staff legal and professional fees and general and administrative expenses that have not been allocated to the coalitions the increase in corporate headquarters’ costs in 2013 over 2012 was primarily due to an increase in charitable contributions the increase in corporate headquarters’ costs in 2012 over 2011 was driven by increases in compensation incremental costs related to the integration of timberland and investments in strategy and innovation 

  

other 

this category includes i costs of corporate programs or corporatemanaged decisions that are not allocated to the coalitions ii costs of registering maintaining and enforcing certain of vf’s trademarks and iii miscellaneous consolidated costs the most significant of which is related to the expense of vf’s centrallymanaged us defined benefit pension plans the current year service cost component of pension expense is allocated to the coalitions while the remaining cost components totaling 609 million for 2013 672 million for 2012 and 338 million for 2011 are reported in corporate and other expenses the increase in other expenses in 2013 compared with 2012 was driven by the 420 million gain on the sale of john varvatos which was recorded as an offset to other expenses in 2012 in addition an increase in deferred compensation expense in 2013 was partially offset by lower pension expense 

the decrease in other expenses in 2012 compared with 2011 is due to the 420 million gain on the sale of john varvatos and a decrease in deferred compensation expense partially offset by higher pension expense other expenses in 2011 were reduced by 80 million from an inventory accounting change from lifo to fifo 

analysis of financial condition 

balance sheets 

the following discussion refers to significant changes in balances at december 2013 compared with december 2012 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the funded status of the defined benefit pension plans is reflected in the balance sheet as the excess or deficiency of pension plan assets compared with projected benefit obligations payable to plan participants the underfunded status of the defined benefit pension plans was 2212 million at the end of 2013 compared with 4829 million at the end of 2012 the improvement in the funded status as of december 2013 was due to an increase in the discount rates used to value the projected benefit obligations and a 1000 million discretionary contribution see the “critical accounting policies and estimates” section below and note m to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the defined benefit pension plans 

liquidity and cash flows 

the financial condition of vf is reflected in the following 

 

   

for the ratio of debt to total capital debt is defined as shortterm and longterm debt and total capital is defined as debt plus stockholders’ equity the ratio of net debt to total net capital with net debt defined as debt less cash and equivalents and total net capital defined as total capital less cash and equivalents was 100 at december 2013 and 196 at december 2012 

in summary our cash flows were as follows in millions 

 

 cash provided by operating activities 

vf’s primary source of liquidity is the strong cash flow provided by operating activities which is dependent on the level of net income and changes in working capital cash provided by operating activities was 15 billion in 2013 13 billion in 2012 and 11 billion in 2011 the improvement in 2013 is due to increased net income and higher levels of noncash adjustments related to i pension and deferred compensation obligations ii depreciation and amortization reflecting the elevated levels of capital expenditures in recent years and iii the 2012 gain on the sale of john varatos the net change in operating assets and liabilities was essentially the same in 2013 and 2012 reflecting a slightly improved use of working capital considering the growth in the business 

the improvement in cash provided by operations in 2012 is due to the increase in net income and changes in operating assets and liabilities which resulted in 348 million of net cash used in 2012 compared with 1651 million of net cash used in 2011 the net cash used in 2012 was primarily driven by the decreases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities at december 2012 related to the timing of inventory and income tax payments and the payment of a 1000 million discretionary pension plan contribution in december 2012 

cash used by investing activities 

cash used by investing activities was 3503 million in 2013 2203 million in 2012 and 24600 in 2011 vf’s investing activities related primarily to capital expenditures of 2712 million and software purchases of 540 million which increased a combined 423 million in 2013 compared with 2012 the higher levels of spending were related to a number of infrastructure projects that support vf’s continued experience and expectations for revenue growth including i a european headquarters ii additional distribution facilities iii new retail stores and iv system implementations vf expects capital spending to approximate 2700 million in 2014 to support continued growth this spending is expected to be funded by cash flow from operations 

capital expenditures were 2519 million in 2012 and included i a european headquarters ii a us headquarters for the outdoor  action sports businesses iii additional distribution facilities and iv new retail stores in addition cash used by investing activities in 2012 was reduced by 685 million in proceeds from the sale of john varatos capital expenditures were 1709 in 2011 primarily relating to new retail stores distribution network and information systems costs 

cash used by investing activities in 2011 included 22 billion of cash paid related to the timberland acquisition 

cash provided used by financing activities 

cash used by financing activities was 9838 million and 8025 million in 2013 and 2012 respectively and cash provided by financing activities was 9122 million in 2011 the increase in cash used by financing 

  

activities in 2013 was primarily due to the repayment of 4000 million of debt and a 689 million increase in cash dividends paid the change from cash used by financing activities in 2012 as compared with cash provided by financing activities in 2011 was primarily due to 9000 million in proceeds from longterm debt in order to finance the timberland acquisition in 2011 as well as 3000 million in open market purchases of common stock in 2012 in addition shortterm borrowings used to fund the timberland acquisition in 2011 were repaid in 2012 

during 2013 2012 and 2011 vf purchased 68 million 80 million and 03 million shares respectively of its common stock in open market transactions the respective cost was 2821 million 2997 million and 74 million with an average price of 4119 in 2013 3713 in 2012 and 2495 in 2011 fewer shares were repurchased in 2011 due to the funding of the timberland acquisition 

in december 2013 vf’s board of directors authorized an additional 500 million shares of common stock for its stock repurchase program which when combined with remaining shares from a prior authorization brought the total authorization to 528 million shares vf will continue to evaluate future share repurchases considering funding required for business acquisitions vf’s common stock price and levels of stock option exercises 

vf relies on continued strong cash generation to finance its ongoing operations in addition vf has significant liquidity from its available cash balances and credit facilities vf maintains a 125 billion senior unsecured revolving line of credit the “global credit facility” which supports its 125 billion us commercial paper program for shortterm seasonal working capital requirements the global credit facility expires in december 2016 as of december 2013 there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding and the entire amount of the global credit facility was available for borrowing except for 174 million of standby letters of credit issued on behalf of vf 

vf’s favorable credit agency ratings allow for access to additional capital at competitive rates at the end of 2013 vf’s longterm debt ratings were ‘a minus’ by standard  poor’s ratings services and ‘a3’ by moody’s investors service and commercial paper ratings were ‘a2’ and ‘prime2’ respectively none of vf’s longterm debt agreements contain acceleration of maturity clauses based solely on changes in credit ratings however if there were a change in control of vf and as a result of the change in control the 2017 2021 and 2037 notes were rated below investment grade by recognized rating agencies vf would be obligated to repurchase the notes at 101 of the aggregate principal amount of notes repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest 

cash dividends totaled 09150 per common share in 2013 compared with 07575 in 2012 and 06525 in 2011 the dividend payout rate was 338 of diluted earnings per share in 2013 312 in 2012 and 327 in 2011 the current indicated annual dividend rate for 2014 is 105 per share 

as of december 2013 approximately 2757 million of cash and shortterm investments was held by international subsidiaries whose undistributed earnings are considered permanently reinvested vf’s intent is to reinvest these funds in international operations if management decides at a later date to repatriate these funds to the us vf would be required to provide taxes on these amounts based on applicable us tax rates net of foreign taxes already paid 

  

following is a summary of vf’s contractual obligations and commercial commitments at the end of 2013 that will require the use of funds 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 vf had other financial commitments at the end of 2013 that are not included in the above table but may require the use of funds under certain circumstances 

 

  

  

   

management believes that vf’s cash balances and funds provided by operating activities as well as unused bank credit lines additional borrowing capacity and access to capital markets taken as a whole provide i adequate liquidity to meet all of its current and longterm obligations when due ii adequate liquidity to fund capital expenditures and to maintain the dividend payout policy and iii flexibility to meet investment opportunities that may arise 

vf does not participate in transactions with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships established to facilitate offbalance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes 

risk management 

vf is exposed to risks in the ordinary course of business management regularly assesses and manages exposures to these risks through operating and financing activities and when appropriate by i taking advantage of natural hedges within vf ii purchasing insurance from commercial carriers or iii using derivative financial instruments some potential risks are discussed below 

insured risks 

vf selfinsures a substantial portion of employee group medical worker’s compensation vehicle property director and officer and general liability exposures and purchases insurance from highlyrated commercial carriers for losses in excess of retained exposures 

cash and equivalents risks 

vf had 7764 million of cash and equivalents at the end of 2013 which includes demand deposits money market funds and shortterm time deposits management continually monitors the credit ratings of the financial institutions with whom vf conducts business similarly management monitors the credit quality of cash equivalents 

defined benefit pension plan risks 

vf has defined benefit pension plans that have risk associated with their investment portfolios at the end of 2013 vf’s pension plans were underfunded by 2212 million which is recorded as a liability on the consolidated balance sheet vf has made significant cash contributions in recent years to improve the funded status of the plans including discretionary contributions of 1000 million in both 2012 and 2013 vf will continue to evaluate the funded status and future funding requirements of these plans which depends in part on the future performance of the plans’ investment portfolios management believes that vf has sufficient liquidity to make any required contributions to the pension plans in future years 

vf’s reported earnings are subject to risks due to the volatility of its pension expense pension expense has ranged from 566 million to 927 million over the last three years with the fluctuations primarily due to varying amounts of actuarial gains and losses that are deferred and amortized to future years’ expense the assumptions that impact actuarial gains and losses include the rate of return on investments held by the pension plans the discount rate used to value participant liabilities and demographic characteristics of the participants 

vf has taken several steps to reduce the risk and volatility in the pension plans and their impact on the financial statements beginning in 2005 vf’s us defined benefit plans were closed to new entrants which did not affect the benefits of existing plan participants at that date or their accrual of future benefits in march 2012 the investment strategy of the us defined benefit plan was modified to more closely align characteristics of the plan’s assets relative to plan liabilities and to implement dynamic asset allocation targets dependent upon changes in the plan’s funded ratio capital market expectations and risk tolerance management will continue to evaluate actions that may help to reduce vf’s risks related to its defined benefit plans 

  

interest rate risks 

vf limits the risk of interest rate fluctuations by managing the mix of fixed and variable interest rate debt in addition vf may use derivative financial instruments to manage risk since a significant portion of vf’s longterm debt has fixed interest rates the exposure primarily relates to changes in interest rates on variable rate shortterm borrowings which averaged 1840 million during 2013 and the 4000 million of floating rate notes repaid during 2013 which together averaged 4460 million outstanding during 2013 however any change in interest rates would also affect interest income earned on vf’s cash equivalents based on the average amount of variable rate borrowings and cash equivalents during 2013 the effect on reported net income of a hypothetical 10 change in interest rates is approximately 27 million 

foreign currency exchange rate risks 

vf is a global enterprise subject to the risk of foreign currency fluctuations approximately 38 of vf’s revenues in 2013 were generated in international markets most of vf’s foreign businesses operate in functional currencies other than the us dollar if the us dollar strengthened relative to the euro or other foreign currencies where vf has operations there would be a negative impact on vf’s operating results upon translation of those foreign operating results into the us dollar vf does not hedge the translation of foreign currency operating results into the us dollar however management does hedge foreign currency transactions as discussed later in this section 

the reported values of assets and liabilities in these foreign businesses are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for net advances to and investments in vf’s foreign businesses that are considered to be longterm the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on those longterm advances are deferred as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders’ equity the us dollar value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries fluctuates with changes in the underlying functional currencies vf generally does not hedge this balance sheet translation exposure 

vf monitors net foreign currency market exposures and enters into derivative foreign currency contracts to hedge the effects of exchange rate fluctuations for a significant portion of forecasted foreign currency cash flows or specific foreign currency transactions relating to crossborder inventory purchases production costs product sales and intercompany royalty payments vf’s practice is to buy or sell primarily us dollar contracts up to 80 of foreign currency exposures for periods of up to 24 months currently vf uses only forward exchange contracts but may use options or collars in the future this use of financial instruments allows management to reduce the overall exposure to risks from exchange rate fluctuations on vf’s cash flows and earnings since gains and losses on these contracts will offset losses and gains on the cash flows or transactions being hedged 

for cash flow hedging contracts outstanding at the end of 2013 if there were a hypothetical change in foreign currency exchange rates of 10 compared with rates at the end of 2013 it would result in a change in fair value of those contracts of approximately 1564 million however any change in the fair value of the hedging contracts would be offset by a change in the fair value of the underlying hedged exposure impacted by the currency rate changes 

counterparty risks 

vf is exposed to creditrelated losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to derivative hedging instruments to manage this risk we have established counterparty credit guidelines and only enter into derivative transactions with financial institutions with ‘a minusa3’ investment grade credit ratings or better vf continually monitors the credit rating of and limits the amount hedged with each counterparty additionally management utilizes a portfolio of financial institutions to minimize exposure to potential counterparty defaults and will adjust positions if necessary vf also monitors counterparty risk for derivative contracts within the defined benefit pension plans 

  

commodity price risks 

vf is exposed to market risks for the pricing of cotton leather rubber wool and other materials which we either purchase directly or in a converted form such as fabric or shoe soles to manage risks of commodity price changes management negotiates prices in advance when possible vf has not historically managed commodity price exposures by using derivative instruments 

deferred compensation and related investment security risks 

vf has nonqualified deferred compensation plans in which liabilities to the plans’ participants are based on the market values of hypothetical portfolios of investment funds including vf common stock selected by the participants vf invests in a portfolio of securities that substantially mirrors the participants’ investment selections except for investments in vf common stock the increases and decreases in deferred compensation liabilities are substantially offset by corresponding increases and decreases in the market value of vf’s investments resulting in an insignificant net exposure to operating results and financial position the vf common stock is treated as treasury shares for financial reporting purposes so any gains or losses on shares held by the plans result in exposure to operating results and financial position as a result of the change in participant liabilities 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

vf has chosen accounting policies that management believes are appropriate to accurately and fairly report vf’s operating results and financial position in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us vf applies these accounting policies in a consistent manner significant accounting policies are summarized in note a to the consolidated financial statements 

the application of these accounting policies requires that vf make estimates and assumptions about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses contingent assets and liabilities and related disclosures these estimates assumptions and judgments are based on historical experience current trends and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis because vf’s business cycle is relatively short ie from the date that an order is placed to manufacture or purchase inventory until that inventory is sold and the trade receivable is collected actual results related to most estimates are known within a few months after any balance sheet date in addition vf may retain outside specialists to assist in valuations of business acquisitions impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets equity compensation pension benefits and selfinsured liabilities if actual results ultimately differ from previous estimates the revisions are included in results of operations in the period in which the actual amounts become known 

vf believes the following accounting policies involve the most significant management estimates assumptions and judgments used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements or are the most sensitive to change from outside factors the application of these critical accounting policies and estimates is discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors 

inventories 

vf’s inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value cost includes all material labor and overhead costs incurred to manufacture or purchase the finished goods overhead allocated to manufactured product is based on the normal capacity of plants and does not include amounts related to idle capacity or abnormal production inefficiencies market value is based on a detailed review at each business unit at least quarterly of all inventories on the basis of individual styles or individual stylesizecolor stockkeeping units “skus” to identify slow moving or excess products discontinued and tobediscontinued products and offquality merchandise this review matches inventory on hand plus current production and purchase 

  

commitments with current and expected future sales orders for those units in inventory that are identified as slowmoving excess or offquality vf estimates their market value based on historical experience and current realization trends this evaluation performed using a systematic and consistent methodology requires forecasts of future demand market conditions and selling prices if the forecasted market value on an individual style or sku basis is less than cost vf provides an allowance to reflect the lower value of that inventory this methodology recognizes inventory exposures on an individual style or sku basis at the time such losses are evident rather than at the time goods are actually sold historically these estimates of future demand and selling prices have not varied significantly from actual results due to vf’s timely identification and rapid disposal of these reduced value inventories 

physical inventory counts are taken on a regular basis vf provides for estimated inventory losses that have likely occurred since the last physical inventory date historically physical inventory shrinkage has not been significant vf also conducts cycle counts at many locations throughout the year 

longlived assets 

vf allocates the purchase price of an acquired business to the fair values of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed with any excess purchase price recorded as goodwill vf evaluates fair value using three valuation techniques — the replacement cost market and income methods — and weights the valuation methods based on what is most appropriate in the circumstances the process of assigning fair values particularly to acquired intangible assets is highly subjective 

vf’s depreciation policies for property plant and equipment reflect judgments on their estimated economic lives and residual value if any vf’s amortization policies for intangible assets reflect judgments on the estimated amounts and duration of future cash flows expected to be generated by those assets in evaluating expected benefits to be received for customerrelated intangible assets management considers historical attrition patterns for various groups of customers for licenserelated intangible assets management considers historical trends and anticipated license renewal periods based on experience in renewing or extending similar arrangements regardless of whether there are explicit renewal provisions 

vf’s policy is to review property plant and equipment and intangible assets with identified useful lives for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable vf tests for possible impairment at the asset or asset group level which is the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent vf measures recoverability of the carrying value of an asset or asset group by comparison with estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if forecasted undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset are not expected to be adequate to recover the asset’s carrying value an impairment charge is recorded for the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its estimated fair value 

vf’s policy is to evaluate indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill for possible impairment at the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable vf first assesses qualitative factors as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform quantitative impairment testing if vf determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of an asset or reporting unit is less than its carrying value then no further testing is required otherwise the assets must be quantitatively tested for impairment 

an indefinitelived intangible asset is quantitatively tested for possible impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset with its carrying value fair value of an indefinitelived trademark or trade name intangible asset is based on an income approach using the relieffromroyalty method under this method forecasted global revenues for products sold with the trademark or trade name are assigned a royalty rate that would be charged to license the trademark or trade name in lieu of ownership from an independent party and fair value is the present value of those forecasted royalties avoided by owning the trademark or trade name if the 

  

estimated fair value of the trademark or trade name intangible asset exceeds its carrying value there is no impairment charge if the estimated fair value of the trademark or trade name is less than its carrying value an impairment charge would be recognized for the difference 

goodwill is quantitatively evaluated for possible impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of a business unit with its carrying value reporting units are either coalitions or business units if discrete financial information is available and reviewed by coalition management two or more reporting units may be aggregated for impairment testing if they have similar economic characteristics in the first step of the quantitative goodwill impairment test vf compares the carrying value of a reporting unit including its recorded goodwill to the estimated fair value of the reporting unit vf estimates the fair value of a reporting unit using both incomebased and marketbased valuation methods the principal method used is an incomebased method in which the reporting unit’s forecasted future cash flows are discounted to their present value in the marketbased valuation method the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is estimated using multiples of revenues and of earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” for i a group of comparable public companies and ii recent transactions if any involving comparable companies based on the range of estimated fair values developed from the income and marketbased methods vf determines the estimated fair value for the reporting unit if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value the goodwill is not impaired and no further review is required however if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value vf performs the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the impairment charge if any the second step involves a hypothetical allocation of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its net tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill as if the reporting unit were newly acquired which results in an implied fair value of the goodwill the amount of the impairment charge is the excess of the recorded goodwill over the implied fair value of the goodwill 

the incomebased fair value methodology requires management’s assumptions and judgments regarding economic conditions in the markets in which vf operates and conditions in the capital markets many of which are outside of management’s control at the reporting unit level fair value estimation requires management’s assumptions and judgments regarding the effects of overall economic conditions on the specific reporting unit along with assessment of the reporting unit’s strategies and forecasts of future cash flows forecasts of individual reporting unit cash flows involve management’s estimates and assumptions regarding 

 

  

  

 under the marketbased fair value methodology judgment is required in evaluating market multiples and recent transactions management believes that the assumptions used for its impairment tests are representative of those that would be used by market participants performing similar valuations of vf’s reporting units 

in its fourth quarter 2013 intangible asset impairment testing vf elected to perform a qualitative assessment for goodwill at all reporting units except for the splendid ® and ella moss ® reporting unit and for trademark intangible assets at all reporting units except for the splendid ® and ella moss ® and 7 for all mankind ® reporting units management did not elect to perform a qualitative analysis for the splendid ® and ella moss ® and 7 for all mankind ® reporting units based on the results of previous impairment testing 

  

vf management performed a quantitative impairment analysis of the goodwill and trademark intangible asset for the splendid ® and ella moss ® reporting unit and concluded that the goodwill and trademark intangible assets for the splendid ® and ella moss ® reporting unit are not impaired for goodwill the estimated fair value exceeded the reporting unit’s carrying value by approximately 50 in 2013 and 2012 the estimated fair value of the trademark intangible asset exceeded its carrying value by a significant amount in 2013 and 2012 

additionally vf performed a fair value assessment of the trademark intangible asset at the 7 for all mankind ® reporting unit and determined that the estimated fair value exceeded the carrying value by approximately 20 or more in 2013 and 2012 the financial results for this business have reflected softness in the premium denim market in recent years which has been considered in our forecast a portion of the original value of this intangible asset was impaired as part of the 2010 impairment analysis and was written down from a carrying value of 3118 million to an estimated fair value of 3052 million at that time all goodwill related to the 7 for all mankind ® reporting unit was written off as part of the 2010 impairment analysis 

key assumptions developed by vf management and used in our quantitative analysis of the splendid ® and ella moss ® and 7 for all mankind ® reporting units include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 actual results for the splendid ® and ella moss ® and 7 for all mankind ® reporting units may vary accordingly management performed sensitivity analysis on the impairment models and concluded that the reporting units and intangible assets were not impaired even with changes made to key assumptions for example a 50 decrease in the forecasted cumulative average revenue growth rate used in the intangible asset impairment models for the 7 for all mankind ® and splendid ® and ella moss ® reporting units did not result in an impairment similarly for goodwill a 50 decrease in forecasted segment profit did not impair the splendid ® and ella moss ® reporting unit separately a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate did not indicate impairment in the splendid ® and ella moss ® reporting unit or the 7 for all mankind ® intangible asset 

for all other reporting units vf elected to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the goodwill and trademark intangible assets in those reporting units were impaired in this qualitative assessment vf considered relevant events and circumstances for each reporting unit including i overall financial performance including management’s five year forecast current and prior year balance sheets and actual to budgeted performance ii industry and market conditions in which the reporting unit operates iii macroeconomic conditions including any deterioration of general conditions and iv changes in products or services offered by the reporting unit we also compared the carrying values of these assets against the fair value results from the most recent testing noting that the fair value significantly exceeded carrying value in each case based on the results of the qualitative assessment vf concluded that it was not more likely than not that the carrying values of the goodwill and trademark intangible assets were greater than the fair values and that further quantitative testing was not necessary 

it is possible that vf’s conclusions regarding impairment or recoverability of goodwill or intangible assets in any reporting unit could change in future periods there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions used in our goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing performed as of the fourth quarter of 

  

2013 will prove to be accurate predictions of the future if for example i the businesses do not perform as projected ii overall economic conditions in 2014 or future years vary from current assumptions including changes in discount rates iii business conditions or strategies for a specific reporting unit change from current assumptions iv investors require higher rates of return on equity investments in the marketplace or v enterprise values of comparable publicly traded companies or actual sales transactions of comparable companies were to decline resulting in lower multiples of revenues and ebitda 

a future impairment charge for goodwill or intangible assets could have a material effect on vf’s consolidated financial position and results of operations 

stock options 

vf uses a lattice optionpricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees and nonemployee members of the board of directors vf believes that a lattice model provides a refined estimate of the fair value of options because it can incorporate i historical option exercise patterns and multiple assumptions about future option exercise patterns for each of several groups of option holders and ii inputs that vary over time such as assumptions for interest rates and volatility management performs an annual review of all assumptions employed in the valuation of option grants and believes they are reflective of the outstanding options and underlying common stock and of groups of option participants the lattice valuation is based on the assumptions listed in note o to the consolidated financial statements 

one of the critical assumptions in the valuation process is estimating the expected average life of the options before they are exercised for each option grant vf estimated the expected average life based on evaluations of the historical and expected option exercise patterns for each of the groups of option holders that have historically exhibited different option exercise patterns these evaluations included i voluntary stock option exercise patterns based on a combination of changes in the price of vf common stock and periods of time that options are outstanding before exercise and ii involuntary exercise patterns resulting from turnover retirement and mortality 

volatility is another critical assumption requiring judgment management based its estimates of future volatility on a combination of implied and historical volatility implied volatility was based on shortterm 6 to 9 months publicly traded nearthemoney options on vf common stock vf measures historical volatility over a ten year period corresponding to the contractual term of the options using daily stock prices management’s assumption for valuation purposes was that expected volatility starts at a level equal to the implied volatility and then transitions to the historical volatility over the remainder of the ten year option term 

pension obligations 

vf sponsors a qualified defined benefit pension plan covering most fulltime us employees hired before 2005 and an unfunded supplemental defined benefit plan that provides benefits in excess of the limitations imposed by income tax regulations vf also sponsors defined benefit plans covering selected international employees the selection of actuarial assumptions for determining the projected pension benefit liabilities and annual pension expense is significant due to amounts involved and the long time period over which benefits are accrued and paid 

management reviews annually the principal economic actuarial assumptions summarized in note m to the consolidated financial statements and modifies them based on current rates and trends vf also periodically reviews and modifies as necessary other plan assumptions such as rates of compensation increases retirement termination disability and mortality vf believes the assumptions appropriately reflect the participants’ demographics and projected benefit obligations of the plans and result in the best estimate of the plans’ future experience actual results may vary from the actuarial assumptions used 

one of the critical assumptions used in the actuarial model is the discount rate this discussion of discount rate and the discussion of return on assets in the next paragraph relate specifically to the us pension plans 

  

which comprise approximately 92 of plan assets and projected benefit obligations of the combined us and international plans the discount rate is used to estimate the present value of future cash outflows necessary to meet projected benefit obligations for the specific plan it is the estimated interest rate that vf could use to settle its projected benefit obligations at the valuation date the discount rate assumption is based on current market interest rates vf selects a discount rate by matching high quality corporate bond yields to the timing of projected benefit payments to participants in the specific us pension plans vf uses the population of us corporate bonds rated ‘aa’ by moody’s investors service or if a moody’s rating is not available bonds rated ‘aa’ by two other recognized rating services from this population of approximately 500 such bonds having at least 500 million outstanding that are noncallablenonputable unless with makewhole provisions vf excluded the highest and lowest yielding bonds each plan’s projected benefit payments are matched to current market interest rates over the expected payment period and a present value is developed that produces a single discount rate that recognizes each plan’s distinct liability characteristics vf believes that those ‘aa’ rated issues meet the “high quality” intent of the applicable accounting standards and that the 2013 discount rate of 500 for the us qualified defined benefit pension plan and 490 for the unfunded supplemental defined benefit plan appropriately reflects current market conditions and the longterm nature of projected benefit payments to participants in the aggregated us pension plans this higher discount rate compared with the rate of 405 at the end of 2012 reflects the general increase in yields of us government obligations and high quality corporate bonds during 2013 the discount rate for the plans may differ from the rates used by other companies because of longer expected duration of benefit payments reflecting i the higher percentage of female participants who generally have a longer life expectancy than males and ii the higher percentage of inactive participants who will not begin receiving vested benefits for many years 

another critical assumption of the actuarial model is the expected longterm rate of return on investments vf’s investment objective is to invest in a diversified portfolio of assets with an acceptable level of risk to maximize the longterm return while minimizing volatility of the value of plan assets relative to value of plan liabilities these risks include market interest rate credit liquidity and foreign securities risks investment assets consist of domestic and international equity corporate and governmental fixed income and alternative assets vf develops a projected rate of return for each of the investment asset classes based on many factors including recent and historical returns the estimated inflation rate the premium to be earned in excess of a riskfree return the premium for equity risk and the premium for longer duration fixed income securities the weighted average projected longterm rates of return of the various assets held by the qualified plan provide the basis for the expected longterm rate of return actuarial assumption vf’s rate of return assumption was 700 in 2013 750 in 2012 and 775 in 2011 in recent years vf has altered the investment mix to improve investment performance by i increasing the allocation to fixed income investments and reducing the allocation to equity investments ii increasing the allocation in equities to more international investments and iii adding alternative assets as an asset class the changes in asset allocation are anticipated over time to reduce the yeartoyear variability of the domestic plan’s funded status and resulting pension expense based on an evaluation of market conditions and projected market returns vf will be using a rate of return assumption of 650 for the us plan for 2014 management monitors the plan’s asset allocation to balance anticipated investment returns with risk 

differences between actual results and the respective actuarially determined assumed results eg investment performance discount rates and other assumptions in a given year do not affect that year’s pension expense but instead are deferred as unrecognized actuarial gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheet at the end of 2013 there were 4229 million of accumulated pretax deferred actuarial losses plus 276 million of deferred prior service costs resulting in an after tax amount of 2775 million in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the 2013 consolidated balance sheet these deferred losses will be amortized as a component of future years’ pension expense 

pension expense recognized in the financial statements was 895 million in 2013 927 million in 2012 and 566 million in 2011 this compares with the cost of pension benefits actually earned by covered active employees commonly called “service cost” of 254 million in 2013 232 million in 2012 and 209 million in 2011 pension expense for the last three years was significantly higher than the annual service cost because those 

  

years included the cost of amortizing prior years’ unrecognized actuarial losses as discussed in the preceding paragraph looking forward vf expects 2014 pension expense to decrease to approximately 580 million primarily due to discretionary funding in 2013 and a decrease in amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses due primarily to an increase in the discount rate 

the sensitivity of changes in actuarial assumptions on 2013 pension expense and on projected benefit obligations related to the us defined benefit pension plan at the end of 2013 all other factors being equal is illustrated by the following 

 

 as discussed in the “risk management” section above vf has taken several steps to reduce volatility in the pension plans and their impact on the financial statements on a longerterm basis vf believes the yeartoyear variability of the retirement benefit expense should decrease 

income taxes 

as a global company vf is subject to income taxes and files income tax returns in over 100 domestic and foreign jurisdictions each year almost every jurisdiction in which vf operates has a lower effective income tax rate than the us as discussed in note p vf has been granted a lower effective income tax rate on taxable earnings in certain foreign jurisdictions we do not currently believe there is substantial risk to our ability to maintain a low foreign effective tax rate based on the economic conditions of the jurisdictions in which we operate however vf makes an ongoing assessment to identify any significant exposure related to increases in tax rates in these foreign jurisdictions and will supplement future disclosures as applicable 

the calculation of income tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations which are subject to legal interpretation and significant management judgment vf’s income tax returns are regularly examined by federal state and foreign tax authorities and those audits may result in proposed adjustments vf has reviewed all issues raised upon examination as well as any exposure for issues that may be raised in future examinations vf has evaluated these potential issues under the “morelikelythannot” standard of the accounting literature a tax position is recognized if it meets this standard and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized such judgments and estimates may change based on audit settlements court cases and interpretation of tax laws and regulations income tax expense could be materially affected to the extent vf prevails in a tax position or when the statute of limitations expires for a tax position for which a liability for unrecognized tax benefits or valuation allowances has been established or to the extent vf is required to pay amounts greater than the established liability for unrecognized tax benefits vf does not currently anticipate any material impact on earnings from the ultimate resolution of income tax uncertainties there are no accruals for general or unknown tax expenses 

vf has 1237 million of gross deferred income tax assets related to operating loss and capital loss carryforwards and 1019 million of valuation allowances against those assets realization of deferred tax assets related to operating loss and capital loss carryforwards is dependent on future taxable income in specific jurisdictions the amount and timing of which are uncertain and on possible changes in tax laws if management believes that vf will not be able to generate sufficient taxable income or capital gains to offset losses during the 

  

carryforward periods vf records valuation allowances to reduce those deferred tax assets to amounts expected to be ultimately realized in addition vf has 56 million of valuation allowances against deferred income tax assets unrelated to operating loss and capital loss carryforwards if in a future period management determines that the amount of deferred tax assets to be realized differs from the net recorded amount vf would record an adjustment to income tax expense in that future period 

vf has not provided us income taxes on a portion of the foreign subsidiaries’ undistributed earnings because these earnings are permanently reinvested in the respective foreign jurisdictions vf has not determined the deferred tax liabilities associated with these undistributed earnings as such determination is not practicable if vf decided to remit those earnings to the us in a future period the provision for income taxes could increase in that period 

cautionary statement on forwardlooking statements 

from time to time vf may make oral or written statements including statements in this annual report that constitute “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of the federal securities laws these include statements concerning plans objectives projections and expectations relating to vf’s operations or economic performance and assumptions related thereto

directtoconsumer operations 

our directtoconsumer business includes fullprice stores outlet stores and ecommerce directtoconsumer revenues accounted for 21 of vf’s consolidated total revenues in 2012 as compared to 19 in 2011 

our full price stores allow us to showcase a brand’s full line of current season products with fixtures and imagery that support the brand’s positioning these stores provide high visibility for our brands and products and enable us to stay close to the needs and preferences of our consumers the proper presentation of products in our stores particularly in our showcase stores also helps to increase sellthrough of vf products at our wholesale customers vfoperated full price stores generally provide gross margins and operating margins that are higher than vf averages and a return on investment well above vf averages in addition vf operates outlet stores in both premium outlet malls and more traditional valuebased locations these outlet stores serve an important role in our overall inventory management and profitability by allowing vf to sell a significant portion of excess discontinued and outofseason products at better prices than are otherwise available from outside parties while maintaining the integrity of our brands 

our growing global retail operations include 1129 stores at the end of 2012 of that total there are 1049 single brand stores ie primarily one brand’s product offerings in each store that sell the north face ®  timberland ®  vans ®  nautica ®  7 for all mankind ®  lucy ®  splendid ®  ella moss ®  lee ®  wrangler ®  napapijri ®  kipling ®  and eastpak ® brand products we also operate 80 vf outlet ® stores in the united states that sell a broad selection of excess quantities of vfbranded products as well as women’s intimate apparel childrenswear other apparel and accessories approximately 70 of vfoperated stores offer products at full 

  

price and the remainder are outlet locations approximately 60 of our stores are located in the united states and the remaining 40 are located in europe latin america and asia 

ecommerce is our fastest growing directtoconsumer channel and represents approximately 11 of our directtoconsumer business we currently market the north face ®  timberland ®  smartwool ®  vans ®  lee ®  wrangler ®  7 for all mankind ®  lucy ®  nautica ®  kipling ®  splendid ®  ella moss ®  eastpak ®  napapijri ®  eagle creek ®  and reef ® products online in the united states plus the north face ®  timberland ®  vans ®  7 for all mankind ®  kipling ®  napapijri ®  eastpak ®  and other brands internationally we are continuing to expand our ecommerce initiatives by rolling out additional brand sites in europe and asia and enhancing each brand’s site to deliver a superior consumer experience 

we expect our directtoconsumer business to continue to grow at a faster pace than vf’s overall growth rate as we continue opening stores and expanding our ecommerce presence we opened 141 stores during 2012 and we are planning to open approximately 160 additional locations in 2013 concentrated in the businesses where we see higher retail growth potential — vans ®  the north face ®  timberland ®  splendid ®  and international 

in addition to our directtoconsumer operations our licensees distributors and other independent parties own and operate over 2500 partnership stores these are primarily monobrand stores selling vfbranded products and have the appearance of vfoperated stores most of these partnership stores are located in europe and asia and are concentrated in the north face ®  vans ®  timberland ®  kipling ®  nautica ®  napapijri ®  lee ®  and wrangler ® brands 

licensing arrangements 

as part of our business strategy of expanding market penetration of vfowned brands we may enter into licensing agreements for specific apparel and complementary product categories if such arrangements with independent parties can provide more effective manufacturing distribution and marketing of such products than could be achieved internally we provide support to these business partners and ensure the integrity of our brand names by taking an active role in the design quality control advertising marketing and distribution of licensed products 

licensing arrangements relate to a broad range of vf brands license agreements are for fixed terms of generally three to five years with conditional renewal options each licensee pays royalties to vf based on its sales of licensed products with most agreements providing for a minimum royalty requirement royalties generally range from 4 to 10 of the licensing partners’ net licensed products sales royalty income was 1138 million in 2012 1 of total revenues primarily from the nautica ®  vans ®  timberland ®  the north face ®  lee ®  rock  republic ®  and wrangler ® brands in addition licensees of our brands are generally required to spend from 1 to 5 of their net licensed product sales to advertise vf’s products in some cases these advertising amounts are remitted to vf for advertising on behalf of the licensees 

vf has also entered into license agreements to use trademarks owned by third parties we market apparel under licenses granted by major league baseball the national football league the national basketball association the national hockey league harleydavidson motor company inc major colleges and universities and individual athletes and related organizations most of which contain minimum annual royalty and advertising requirements 

manufacturing sourcing and distribution 

product design fit fabric finish and quality are important in all of our businesses these functions are performed by employees located in our global supply chain organization and our branded business units across the globe 

  

vf’s centralized global supply chain organization is responsible for sourcing and delivering products to our customers vf is highly skilled in managing the complexities associated with our global supply chain on an annual basis vf sources or produces approximately 450 million units spread across 36 brands vf operates 29 manufacturing facilities and utilizes approximately 1900 contractor manufacturing facilities in 60 countries we operate 29 distribution centers and 1129 retail stores managing this complexity is made possible by the use of a network of information systems for product development forecasting order management and warehouse management attached to our core enterprise resource management platforms 

in 2012 28 of our units were manufactured in vfoperated facilities and 72 were obtained from independent contractors primarily in asia products manufactured in vf facilities generally have a lower cost and shorter lead times than contracted production products obtained from contractors in the western hemisphere generally have a higher cost than products obtained from contractors in asia but contracting in the western hemisphere gives us greater flexibility shorter lead times and allows for lower inventory levels this combination of vfowned and contracted production along with different geographic regions and cost structures provides a wellbalanced approach to product sourcing we will continue to manage our supply chain from a global perspective and adjust as needed to changes in the global production environment 

vf operates manufacturing facilities in mexico central and south america the caribbean europe and the middle east a significant percentage of denim bottoms and occupational apparel are manufactured in these plants as well as a smaller percentage of footwear for these owned production facilities we purchase raw materials from numerous domestic and international suppliers to meet our production needs raw materials include products made from cotton leather rubber wool synthetics and blends of cotton and synthetic yarn as well as thread and trim product identification buttons zippers snaps eyelets and laces in some instances we contract the sewing of vfowned raw materials into finished product with independent contractors manufacturing in the united states includes all major league baseball uniforms along with screen printing and embroidery of jerseys tshirts and fleece products fixed price commitments for fabric and certain supplies are generally set on a quarterly basis for the next quarter’s purchases no single supplier represents more than 5 of our total cost of sales 

independent contractors generally own the raw materials and ship finished readyforsale products to vf these contractors are engaged through vf sourcing hubs in hong kong with satellite offices across asia and panama these hubs are responsible for coordinating the manufacturing and procurement of product supplier management product quality assurance and transportation and shipping functions in the eastern and western hemispheres respectively substantially all products in the outdoor  action sports and sportswear coalitions as well as a portion of products for our jeanswear and imagewear coalitions are obtained through these sourcing hubs for most products in our contemporary brands coalition we contract the sewing and finishing of vfowned raw materials through a network of independent contractors based in the united states 

management continually monitors political risks and developments related to duties tariffs and quotas we limit vf’s sourcing exposure through among other measures i diversifying geographies with a mix of vfoperated and contracted production ii shifting of production among countries and contractors iii sourcing production to merchandise categories where product is readily available and iv sourcing from countries with tariff preference and free trade agreements vf does not directly or indirectly source products from suppliers in countries identified by the state department as state sponsors of terrorism and subject to us economic sanctions and export controls 

all vfoperated production facilities throughout the world as well as all independent contractor facilities that manufacture vfbranded products must comply with vf’s global compliance principles these principles established in 1997 and consistent with international labor standards are a set of strict standards covering legal and ethical business practices workers’ ages work hours health and safety conditions environmental standards and compliance with local laws and regulations in addition our owned factories must also undergo certification by the independent nonprofit organization worldwide responsible accredited production “wrap” which 

  

promotes global ethics in manufacturing vf through its contractor monitoring program audits the activities of the independent businesses and contractors that produce vfbranded goods at locations across the globe each of the approximately 1900 independent contractor facilities including those serving our independent licensees must be precertified before producing any vf products this precertification includes passing a factory inspection and signing a vf terms of engagement agreement we maintain an ongoing audit program to ensure compliance with these requirements by using dedicated internal staff and externally contracted firms additional information about vf’s code of business conduct global compliance principles terms of engagement factory compliance guidelines factory audit procedure and environmental compliance guidelines along with a global compliance report is available on the vf website at wwwvfccom 

vf did not experience difficulty in filling its raw material and contracting production needs during 2012 and does not anticipate any difficulty in 2013 we believe that we will be able to remain cost competitive in 2013 due to our scale and significance to our suppliers absent any material changes vf believes it would be able to largely offset any increases in product costs through i the continuing shift in the mix of its business to higher margin brands geographies and channels of distribution ii increases in the prices of its products and iii cost reduction opportunities the loss of any one supplier or contractor would not have a significant adverse effect on our business 

product is shipped from our independent suppliers and vfoperated manufacturing facilities to distribution centers in the united states and international locations in some instances product is shipped directly to our customers most distribution centers are operated by vf and some support more than one brand a portion of our distribution needs are met by contract distribution centers 

seasonality 

vf’s operating results vary from quartertoquarter throughout the year due to the differing sales patterns of our individual businesses on a quarterly basis consolidated total revenues for 2012 ranged from a low of 20 of full year revenues in the second quarter to a high of 29 in the third quarter while consolidated operating income ranged from a low of 11 in the second quarter to a high of 37 in the third quarter this variation results primarily from the seasonal influences on revenues of our outdoor  action sports coalition where 18 of the coalition’s revenues occurred in the second quarter and 32 in the third quarter of 2012 with changes in our mix of business and growth of our retail operations historical quarterly revenue and profit trends may not be indicative of future trends we expect the portion of annual revenues and profits occurring in the second half of the year to continue to increase 

working capital requirements vary throughout the year working capital increases during the first half of the year as inventory builds to support peak shipping periods and then decreases during the second half of the year as those inventories are sold and accounts receivable are collected cash provided by operating activities is substantially higher in the second half of the year due to higher net income during that period and reduced working capital requirements particularly during the fourth quarter 

advertising and customer support 

during 2012 our advertising and promotion spending was 5746 million representing 53 of net sales we advertise in consumer and trade publications on radio and television and through digital initiatives including social media mobile platforms and the internet we also participate in cooperative advertising on a shared cost basis with major retailers in print media radio and television we sponsor sporting musical and special events as well as athletes and personalities who promote our products we employ marketing sciences to optimize the impact of advertising and promotional spending and to identify the types of spending that provide the greatest return on our marketing investments 

we provide advertising support to our wholesale customers in the form of pointofsale fixtures and signage to enhance the presentation and brand image of our products we also participate in shopinshops and 

  

concession arrangements which are separate sales areas dedicated to a specific vf brand within our customers’ stores to help differentiate and enhance the presentation of our products 

we participate in incentive programs with our retailer customers including discounts allowances and cooperative advertising funds we also offer sales incentive programs directly to consumers in the form of rebate and coupon offers 

in addition to sponsorships and activities that directly benefit our products and brands vf and its associates actively support our communities and various charities for example the north face ® brand has committed to programs that encourage and enable outdoor participation such as planet explore ® wwwplanetexplorecom the never stop exploring ® award and the explore your parks tm program the timberland ® brand has a heritage of volunteerism including the path of service ™ program that offers fulltime employees up to 40 hours of paid time off a year to serve their local communities the timberland ® brand also sponsors two annual global service events earth day in the spring and servapalooza in the fall when employees provide assistance to local communities through various volunteer efforts the nautica ® brand supports oceana a notforprofit organization focused on ocean conservation in addition 2012 marked the seventeenth year of support for lee national denim day ®  one of the country’s largest singleday fundraisers for breast cancer that has raised over 88 million since its inception to fight breast cancer vf also supports companywide sustainability efforts and recognizes the “vf 100” to honor the 100 vf associates worldwide having the highest number of volunteer service hours during the year 

other matters 

competitive factors 

our business depends on our ability to stimulate consumer demand for vf’s brands and products vf is wellpositioned to compete in the apparel industry by developing high quality innovative products at competitive prices that meet consumer needs providing high service levels ensuring the right products are on the retail sales floor to meet consumer demand investing significant amounts behind existing brands and continuing to evaluate the potential for acquiring additional brands we continually strive to improve in each of these areas many of vf’s brands have long histories and enjoy strong recognition within their respective consumer segments 

trademarks 

trademarks patents and domain names as well as related logos designs and graphics provide substantial value in the marketing of vf’s products and are important to our continued success we have registered this intellectual property in the united states and in other countries where our products are manufactured andor sold we vigorously monitor and enforce vf’s intellectual property against counterfeiting infringement and violations of other rights where and to the extent legal feasible and appropriate in addition we grant licenses to other parties to manufacture and sell products utilizing our intellectual property in product categories and geographic areas in which vf does not operate 

customers 

vf products are primarily sold on a wholesale basis to specialty stores department stores national chains and mass merchants in addition we sell products on a directtoconsumer basis through vfoperated stores and ecommerce sites which accounted for 21 of our total revenues in 2012 our sales in international markets are growing and represented 37 of our total revenues in 2012 the majority of which were in europe 

sales to vf’s ten largest customers all of which are retailers based in the united states amounted to 21 of total revenues in 2012 23 in 2011 and 26 in 2010 sales to the five largest customers amounted to approximately 16 of total revenues in 2012 18 in 2011 and 21 in 2010 sales to vf’s largest customer 

  

walmart stores inc totaled 8 of total revenues in 2012 9 in 2011 and 10 in 2010 the majority of which were in the jeanswear coalition 

employees 

vf had approximately 57000 employees at the end of 2012 of which approximately 25000 were located in the united states approximately 630 employees in the united states are covered by collective bargaining agreements in international markets a significant percentage of employees are covered by tradesponsored or governmental bargaining arrangements employee relations are considered to be good 

backlog 

the dollar amount of vf’s order backlog as of any date is not meaningful may not be indicative of actual future shipments and accordingly is not material for an understanding of the business of vf taken as a whole

 item 1a risk factors 

the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating vf’s business and the forwardlooking statements contained in this form 10k any of the following risks could materially adversely affect vf’s business its operating results and its financial condition 

vf’s revenues and profits depend on the level of consumer spending for apparel which is sensitive to general economic conditions a return to recessionary conditions or a decline in consumer spending could have a material adverse effect on vf 

the apparel industry has historically been subject to cyclical variations and is particularly affected by adverse trends in the general economy the success of vf’s business depends on consumer spending and there are a number of factors that influence consumer spending including actual and perceived economic conditions disposable consumer income interest rates consumer credit availability unemployment stock market performance extreme weather conditions energy prices and tax rates in the international national regional and local markets where vf’s products are sold consumer spending advanced at a relatively slow pace from 2010 through 2012 following the recessionary conditions of 2008 and early 2009 and the outlook for 2013 is uncertain as consumers face higher taxes a decline in actual or perceived economic conditions or other factors could negatively impact the level of consumer spending and have a material adverse impact on vf 

fluctuations in the price availability and quality of raw materials and finished goods could increase costs 

fluctuations in the price availability and quality of fabrics leather or other raw materials used by vf in its manufactured products or of purchased finished goods could have a material adverse effect on vf’s cost of sales or its ability to meet its customers’ demands the prices we pay depend on demand and market prices for 

  

the raw materials used to produce them the price and availability of such raw materials may fluctuate significantly depending on many factors including general economic conditions and demand crop yields energy prices weather patterns and speculation in the commodities markets prices of purchased finished products also depend on wage rates in asia and other geographic areas where our independent contractors are located as well as freight costs from those regions in the future vf may not be able to offset cost increases with other cost reductions or efficiencies or to pass higher costs on to its customers this could have a material adverse effect on vf’s results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

we may be adversely affected by weather conditions 

our business is adversely affected by unseasonable weather conditions a significant portion of the sales of our products is dependent in part on the weather and is likely to decline in years in which weather conditions do not favor the use of these products periods of unseasonably warm weather in the fall or winter which occurred in the winter of 20112012 may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows inventory accumulation by our wholesale customers resulting from unseasonable weather in one season generally negatively affects orders in future seasons which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

vf’s net sales depend on a volume of traffic to its stores and the availability of suitable lease space 

a growing portion of our revenues are directtoconsumer sales through vfoperated stores in order to generate customer traffic we locate many of our stores in prominent locations within successful retail shopping centers or in fashionable shopping districts our stores benefit from the ability of the retail center and other attractions in an area to generate consumer traffic in the vicinity of our stores part of our future growth is significantly dependent on our ability to operate stores in desirable locations with capital investment and lease costs providing the opportunity to earn a reasonable return we cannot control the development of new shopping centers or districts the availability or cost of appropriate locations within existing or new shopping centers or districts competition with other retailers for prominent locations or the success of individual shopping centers or districts further if we are unable to renew or replace our existing store leases or enter into leases for new stores on favorable terms or if we violate the terms of our current leases our growth and profitability could be harmed all of these factors may impact our ability to meet our growth targets and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

the apparel and footwear industries are highly competitive and vf’s success depends on its ability to respond to constantly changing markets 

vf competes with numerous apparel and footwear brands and manufacturers competition is generally based upon brand name recognition price design product quality selection service and purchasing convenience some of our competitors are larger and have more resources than vf in some product categories and regions in addition vf competes directly with the private label brands of most of its wholesale customers vf’s ability to compete within the apparel and footwear industries depends on our ability to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

 failure to compete effectively or to keep pace with rapidly changing markets and trends could have a material adverse effect on vf’s business financial condition and results of operations 

vf’s results of operations could be materially harmed if we are unable to gauge fashion trends and accurately forecast demand for our products 

our success depends in part on management’s ability to effectively anticipate and respond to changing fashion preferences and consumer demands and to translate trends into marketable product offerings in advance of the actual time of sale to the customer we often schedule internal production and place orders for products with independent manufacturers before our customers’ orders are firm factors that could affect our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products include 

 

  

  

  

  

 there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully anticipate changing fashion trends or economic conditions and as a result we may not successfully manage inventory levels to meet our future order requirements if we fail to accurately forecast consumer demand we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of product required to meet the demand inventory levels in excess of consumer demand may result in inventory writedowns and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices which could have an adverse effect on the image and reputation of vf’s brands and negatively impact profitability on the other hand if we underestimate demand for our products our manufacturing facilities or third party manufacturers may not be able to produce products to meet consumer requirements and this could result in delays in the shipment of products and lost revenues as well as damage to vf’s reputation and relationships these risks could have a material adverse effect on our brand image as well as our results of operations and financial condition 

vf’s business and the success of its products could be harmed if vf is unable to maintain the images of its brands 

vf’s success to date has been due in large part to the growth of its brands’ images and vf’s customers’ connection to its brands if we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to changing consumer demand the names and images of our brands may be impaired even if we react appropriately to changes in consumer preferences consumers may consider our brands’ images to be outdated or associate our brands with styles that are no longer popular in addition brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of qualities including merchandise quality and corporate integrity negative claims or publicity regarding vf its brands or its products including licensed products could adversely affect our reputation and sales regardless of whether such claims are accurate social media which accelerates the dissemination of information can increase the challenges of responding to negative claims in the past many apparel companies have experienced periods of rapid growth in sales and earnings followed by periods of declining sales and losses our businesses may be similarly affected in the future 

  

a substantial portion of vf’s revenues and gross profit is derived from a small number of large customers the loss of any of these customers or the inability of any of these customers to pay their receivables owed to vf could substantially reduce vf’s revenues and profits 

a few of vf’s customers account for a significant portion of revenues sales to vf’s ten largest customers were 21 of total revenues in fiscal 2012 with walmart stores inc accounting for 8 of revenues sales to our customers are generally on a purchase order basis and not subject to longterm agreements a decision by any of vf’s major customers to significantly decrease the volume of products purchased from vf could substantially reduce revenues and have a material adverse effect on vf’s financial condition and results of operations moreover in recent years the retail industry has experienced consolidation and other ownership changes in the future retailers may further consolidate undergo restructurings or reorganizations realign their affiliations or reposition their stores’ target markets these developments could result in a reduction in the number of stores that carry vf’s products an increase in ownership concentration within the retail industry an increase in credit exposure to vf or an increase in leverage by vf’s customers over their suppliers these changes could impact vf’s opportunities in the market and increase vf’s reliance on a smaller number of large customers 

further the global recession — with rising unemployment reduced availability of credit increased savings rates and declines in real estate and securities values — had and is continuing to have a negative impact on retail sales of apparel and other consumer products these lower sales volumes along with the possibility of restrictions on access to the credit markets may result in our customers experiencing financial difficulties including store closures bankruptcies or liquidations this may result in higher credit risk to vf relating to receivables from our customers who are experiencing these financial difficulties if these developments occur our inability to shift sales to other customers or to collect on vf’s trade accounts receivable could have a material adverse effect on vf’s financial condition and results of operations 

vf’s profitability may decline as a result of increasing pressure on margins 

the apparel industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors including intense competition consolidation in the retail industry pressure from retailers to reduce the costs of products and changes in consumer demand if these factors cause us to reduce our sales prices to retailers and consumers and we fail to sufficiently reduce our product costs or operating expenses vf’s profitability will decline this could have a material adverse effect on vf’s results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

vf may not succeed in its growth strategy 

one of vf’s key strategic objectives is growth we seek to grow organically and through acquisitions we seek to grow by building new lifestyle brands expanding our share with winning customers stretching vf’s brands to new regions managing costs leveraging our supply chain and information technology capabilities across vf and expanding our directtoconsumer business including opening new stores and remodeling and expanding our existing stores we may not be able to grow our existing businesses we may have difficulty completing acquisitions and we may not be able to successfully integrate a newly acquired business or achieve the expected growth cost savings or synergies from such integration we may not be able to expand our market share with winning customers expand our brands geographically or achieve the expected results from our supply chain initiatives we may have difficulty recruiting developing or retaining qualified employees we may not be able to achieve our store expansion goals manage our growth effectively successfully integrate the planned new stores into our operations or operate our new remodeled and expanded stores profitably failure to implement our growth strategy may have a material adverse effect on vf’s business 

there are risks associated with vf’s acquisitions 

any acquisitions or mergers by vf will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of companies these risks include among other things higher than anticipated acquisition costs and expenses the difficulty and expense of integrating the operations systems and personnel of the companies and the loss of 

  

key employees and customers as a result of changes in management in addition geographic distances may make integration of acquired businesses more difficult we may not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with any acquisitions including in connection with the current integration of the timberland company acquisition 

our acquisitions may cause large onetime expenses or create goodwill or other intangible assets that could result in significant impairment charges in the future we also make certain estimates and assumptions in order to determine purchase price allocation and estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed if our estimates or assumptions used to value these assets and liabilities are not accurate we may be exposed to losses that may be material 

vf’s operations in international markets and earnings in those markets may be affected by legal regulatory political and economic risks 

our ability to maintain the current level of operations in our existing international markets and to capitalize on growth in existing and new international markets is subject to risks associated with international operations these include the burdens of complying with foreign laws and regulations unexpected changes in regulatory requirements new tariffs or other barriers in some international markets 

we cannot predict whether quotas duties taxes exchange controls or other restrictions will be imposed by the us the european union or other countries on the import or export of our products or what effect any of these actions would have on vf’s business financial condition or results of operations we cannot predict whether there might be changes in our ability to repatriate earnings or capital from international jurisdictions changes in regulatory geopolitical policies and other factors may adversely affect vf’s business or may require us to modify our current business practices 

approximately 62 of vf’s 2012 net income was earned in jurisdictions outside the us vf is exposed to risks of changes in us policy for companies having business operations outside the united states a number of changes in us income tax laws have been proposed recently including overall corporate and individual tax reform some of these tax law changes and tax reform proposals among other things consider accelerating the us taxability of nonus earnings or limit foreign tax credits while enactment of any such proposal is not certain if new legislation were enacted it is possible our us income tax expense could increase which would reduce our earnings 

we may have additional tax liabilities 

as a global company we determine our income tax liability in various competing tax jurisdictions based on an analysis and interpretation of local tax laws and regulations this analysis requires a significant amount of judgment and estimation and is often based on various assumptions about the future actions of the local tax authorities these determinations are the subject of periodic domestic and foreign tax audits although we accrue for uncertain tax positions our accrual may be insufficient to satisfy unfavorable findings unfavorable audit findings and tax rulings may result in payment of taxes fines and penalties for prior periods and higher tax rates in future periods which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows further in an effort to deal with budget deficits governments around the world are focusing on increasing tax revenues through increased audits and potentially increased tax rates for corporations changes in tax law or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly affect the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 

concerns regarding the european debt crisis market perceptions and euro instability could adversely affect vf’s business results of operations and financing 

vf generated approximately 22 of its total revenues from european countries during 2012 concerns persist regarding the debt burden of a number of countries in the eurozone and their ability to meet future financial obligations as well as the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency 

  

given the diverse economic and political circumstances in individual eurozone countries these concerns could lead to the reintroduction of individual currencies in one or more eurozone countries or in more extreme circumstances the possible dissolution of the euro currency entirely should the euro currency and eurozone dissolve entirely the legal and contractual consequences for holders of eurodenominated obligations would be determined by laws in effect at that time these potential developments or market perceptions concerning these and related issues could adversely affect the value of vf’s eurodenominated assets and obligations in addition concerns over the effect of this financial crisis on financial institutions in europe and globally could have an adverse impact on the capital markets generally and more specifically on the ability of vf’s customers suppliers and lenders to finance their respective businesses 

vf uses third party suppliers and manufacturing facilities worldwide for a substantial portion of its raw materials and finished products which poses risks to vf’s business operations 

during fiscal 2012 approximately 72 of vf’s units were purchased from independent manufacturers primarily located in asia with substantially all of the remainder produced by vfowned and operated manufacturing facilities located in mexico central and south america the caribbean europe and the middle east any of the following could impact our ability to produce or deliver vf products 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 although no single supplier and no one country is critical to vf’s production needs if we were to lose a supplier it could result in interruption of finished goods shipments to vf cancellation of orders by customers and termination of relationships this along with the damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on vf’s revenues and consequently our results of operations 

our business is subject to national state and local laws and regulations for environmental employment safety and other matters the costs of compliance with or the violation of such laws and regulations by vf or by independent suppliers who manufacture products for vf could have an adverse effect on our operations and cash flows as well as on our reputation 

our business is subject to comprehensive federal state and local laws and regulations on a wide range of environmental employment safety and other matters vf could be adversely affected by costs of compliance 

  

with or violations of those laws and regulations in addition while we do not control their business practices we require third party suppliers to operate in compliance with applicable laws rules and regulations regarding working conditions employment practices and environmental compliance the costs of products purchased by vf from independent contractors could increase due to the costs of compliance by those contractors 

failure by vf or its third party suppliers to comply with such laws and regulations as well as with ethical social product labor and environmental standards or related political considerations could result in interruption of finished goods shipments to vf cancellation of orders by customers and termination of relationships if one of our independent contractors violates labor or other laws or implements labor or other business practices that are generally regarded as unethical in the united states it could jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions including boycotts that may reduce demand for vf’s merchandise damage to vf’s reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on vf’s results of operations financial condition and cash flows as well as require additional resources to rebuild vf’s reputation 

vf’s business is exposed to the risks of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations vf’s hedging strategies may not be effective in mitigating those risks 

a growing percentage of vf’s total revenues approximately 37 in 2012 is derived from markets outside the us vf’s international businesses operate in functional currencies other than the us dollar changes in currency exchange rates may affect the us dollar value of the foreign currencydenominated amounts at which vf’s international businesses purchase products incur costs or sell products in addition for vf’s usbased businesses the majority of products are sourced from independent contractors or vf plants located in foreign countries as a result the cost of these products may be affected by changes in the value of the relevant currencies furthermore much of vf’s licensing revenue is derived from sales in foreign currencies changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse impact on vf’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in accordance with our operating practices we hedge a significant portion of our foreign currency transaction exposures arising in the ordinary course of business to reduce risks in our cash flows and earnings our hedging strategy may not be effective in reducing all risks and no hedging strategy can completely insulate vf from foreign exchange risk we do not hedge foreign currency translation rate changes 

further our use of derivative financial instruments may expose vf to counterparty risks although vf only enters into hedging contracts with counterparties having investment grade credit ratings it is possible that the credit quality of a counterparty could be downgraded or a counterparty could default on its obligations which could have a material adverse impact on vf’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

vf borrows funds on a shortterm basis primarily to support seasonal working capital requirements longterm debt is part of vf’s total capital structure because of conditions in global credit markets vf may have difficulty accessing capital markets for short or longterm financing 

particularly in 2008 and continuing to a lesser extent during the last four years global capital and credit markets have experienced extreme volatility and disruption with government intervention mergers or bankruptcies of several major financial institutions and a general decline in global liquidity many corporate issuers have been unable to access credit markets 

we typically use shortterm commercial paper borrowings to support seasonal working capital requirements with amounts generally repaid by the end of each year from strong cash flows from operations vf was able to continue to borrow in the commercial paper markets during the last four years in the future vf may seek to access the longterm capital markets to replace maturing debt obligations or to fund acquisition or other growth opportunities there is no assurance that the commercial paper markets or the longterm capital markets 

  

will continue to be reliable sources of financing for vf if vf does not have access to financing it could have a material adverse impact on vf’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

vf has a global revolving credit facility one or more of the participating banks may not be able to honor their commitments which could have an adverse effect on vf’s business 

vf has a 125 billion global revolving credit facility that expires in december 2016 if the financial markets return to recessionary conditions this could impair the ability of one or more of the banks participating in our credit agreements from honoring their commitments this could have an adverse effect on our business if we were not able to replace those commitments or to locate other sources of liquidity on acceptable terms 

the loss of members of vf’s executive management and other key employees could have a material adverse effect on its business 

vf depends on the services and management experience of its executive officers and business leaders who have substantial experience and expertise in vf’s business vf also depends on other key employees involved in the operation of its business competition for experienced and wellqualified personnel is intense the unexpected loss of services of one or more of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on vf 

vf may be unable to protect its trademarks and other intellectual property rights 

vf’s trademarks and other intellectual property rights are important to its success and its competitive position vf is susceptible to others copying its products and infringing its intellectual property rights especially with the shift in product mix to higher priced brands and innovative new products in recent years some of vf’s brands such as the north face ®  timberland ®  vans ®  jansport ®  nautica ®  wrangler ® and lee ® brands enjoy significant worldwide consumer recognition and the higher pricing of those products creates additional risk of counterfeiting and infringement 

counterfeiting of vf’s products or infringement on its intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our brands and adversely affect vf’s revenues actions we have taken to establish and protect vf’s intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent copying of its products by others or to prevent others from seeking to invalidate its trademarks or block sales of vf’s products as a violation of the trademarks and intellectual property rights of others in addition unilateral actions in the united states or other countries including changes to or the repeal of laws recognizing trademark or other intellectual property rights could have an impact on vf’s ability to enforce those rights 

the value of vf’s intellectual property could diminish if others assert rights in or ownership of trademarks and other intellectual property rights of vf or trademarks that are similar to vf’s trademarks or trademarks that vf licenses from others we may be unable to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction in some cases there may be trademark owners who have prior rights to vf’s trademarks because the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states in other cases there may be holders who have prior rights to similar trademarks vf is from time to time involved in opposition and cancellation proceedings with respect to some of its intellectual property rights 

vf is subject to the risk that its licensees may not generate expected sales or maintain the value of vf’s brands 

during 2012 1138 million of vf’s revenues were derived from licensing royalties although vf generally has significant control over its licensees’ products and advertising we rely on our licensees for among other things operational and financial controls over their businesses failure of our licensees to successfully market licensed products or our inability to replace existing licensees if necessary could adversely affect vf’s revenues both directly from reduced royalties received and indirectly from reduced sales of our other products risks are also associated with a licensee’s ability to 

 

   

  

  

  

  

 in addition vf relies on its licensees to help preserve the value of its brands although we attempt to protect vf’s brands through approval rights over design production processes quality packaging merchandising distribution advertising and promotion of our licensed products we cannot completely control the use of licensed vf brands by our licensees the misuse of a brand by a licensee could have a material adverse effect on that brand and on vf 

vf has entered into license agreements to use the trademarks of others loss of a license could have an adverse effect on vf’s operating results 

vf has entered into agreements to market products under licenses granted by third parties including major league baseball the national football league and harleydavidson motor company inc some of these licenses are for a short term and do not contain renewal options loss of a license which in certain cases could result in an impairment charge for related operating and intangible assets could have an adverse effect on vf’s operating results 

vf relies significantly on information technology any inadequacy interruption integration failure or security failure of this technology could harm vf’s ability to effectively operate its business 

our ability to effectively manage and operate our business depends significantly on information technology systems the failure of these systems to operate effectively problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems difficulty in integrating new systems or systems of acquired businesses or a breach in security of these systems could adversely impact the operations of vf’s business including corporate email communications ecommerce operations retail business credit card transaction authorization and processing and our interaction with the public in the social media space 

in the normal course of business we often collect retain and transmit certain sensitive and confidential customer information including credit card information over public networks there is a significant concern by consumers and employees over the security of personal information transmitted over the internet consumer identity theft and user privacy despite the security measures we currently have in place our facilities and systems and those of our third party service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches and vf and its customers could suffer harm if customer information were accessed by third parties due to a security failure in vf’s systems it could require significant expenditures to remediate any such failure problem or breach and severely damage our reputation and our relationships with customers 

if vf encounters problems with its distribution system vf’s ability to deliver its products to the market could be adversely affected 

vf relies on owned or independentlyoperated distribution facilities to warehouse and ship product to its customers vf’s distribution system includes computercontrolled and automated equipment which may be subject to a number of risks related to security or computer viruses the proper operation of software and hardware power interruptions or other system failures because substantially all of vf’s products are distributed from a relatively small number of locations vf’s operations could also be interrupted by earthquakes floods fires or other natural disasters affecting its distribution centers we maintain business interruption insurance but it may not adequately protect vf from the adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in vf’s 

  

distribution facilities such as the longterm loss of customers or an erosion of brand image in addition vf’s distribution capacity is dependent on the timely performance of services by third parties including the transportation of product to and from its distribution facilities if we encounter problems with our distribution system our ability to meet customer expectations manage inventory complete sales and achieve operating efficiencies could be materially adversely affected 

vf’s balance sheet includes a significant amount of intangible assets and goodwill a decline in the fair value of an intangible asset or of a business unit could result in an asset impairment charge which would be recorded as an operating expense in vf’s consolidated statement of income and could be material 

we evaluate goodwill and nonamortizing trademark intangible assets for possible impairment at least annually in addition intangible assets that are being amortized are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value might not be recoverable for these impairment tests we use various valuation methods to estimate the fair value of our business units and intangible assets if the fair value of an asset is less than its carrying value we would recognize an impairment charge for the difference during 2010 we recognized 2017 million of goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges 

at december 2012 vf had indefinitelived intangible assets of approximately 24 billion related to trademarks and 20 billion of goodwill on its balance sheet in addition vf had approximately 06 billion of intangible assets that are being amortized goodwill and intangible assets combined represent 51 of vf’s total assets and 96 of stockholders’ equity 

it is possible that we could have an impairment charge for goodwill or trademark intangible assets in future periods if i overall economic conditions in 2013 or future years vary from our current assumptions ii business conditions or our strategies for a specific business unit change from our current assumptions iii investors require higher rates of return on equity investments in the marketplace or iv enterprise values of comparable publicly traded companies or of actual sales transactions of comparable companies were to decline resulting in lower comparable multiples of revenues and ebitda and accordingly lower implied values of goodwill and intangible assets a future impairment charge for goodwill or intangible assets could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

volatility in securities markets interest rates and other economic factors could substantially increase vf’s defined benefit pension costs 

vf currently has unfunded obligations under its defined benefit pension plans the funded status of the pension plans is dependent on many factors including returns on investment assets and the discount rate used to determine pension obligations unfavorable returns on plan assets a lower discount rate or unfavorable changes in the applicable laws or regulations could materially change the timing and amount of pension funding requirements which could reduce cash available for vf’s business 

vf’s operating performance also may be negatively impacted by the amount of expense recorded for its pension plans pension expense is calculated using actuarial valuations that incorporate assumptions and estimates about financial market economic and demographic conditions differences between estimated and actual results give rise to gains and losses that are deferred and amortized as part of future pension expense which can create volatility that adversely impacts vf’s future operating results 

vf’s directtoconsumer business includes risks that could have an adverse effect on its results 

vf sells merchandise directtoconsumer through vfoperated stores and over the internet through its websites its directtoconsumer business is subject to numerous risks that could have a material adverse effect on its results risks include but are not limited to a domestic or international resellers purchasing merchandise and reselling it overseas outside vf’s control b failure of the systems that operate the stores and websites and their related support systems including computer viruses theft of customer information privacy concerns telecommunication failures and electronic breakins and similar disruptions c credit card fraud and d risks 

  

related to vf’s directtoconsumer distribution centers risks specific to vf’s ecommerce business also include a diversion of sales from vf stores b difficulty in recreating the instore experience through direct channels and c liability for online content vf’s failure to successfully respond to these risks might adversely affect sales in its internet business as well as damage its reputation and brands

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

vf corporation “vf” is a worldwide leader in branded lifestyle apparel footwear and related products management’s vision is to grow vf by building leading lifestyle brands that excite consumers around the world lifestyle brands representative of the activities and interests that consumers aspire to generally extend across multiple geographic markets and product categories and therefore have greater opportunities for growth 

vf owns a diverse portfolio of brands with strong market positions in many product categories vf has a broad customer base and distributes products through specialty stores upscale and traditional department stores national chains and mass merchants plus directtoconsumer channels 

vf’s businesses are grouped by product categories and by brands within those product categories for both management and internal financial reporting purposes these groupings of businesses are called “coalitions” and are the basis for vf’s reportable business segments the five coalitions are outdoor  action sports jeanswear imagewear sportswear and contemporary brands 

highlights of 2012 

all references to “organic” financial data exclude the timberland ® and smartwool ® brands “timberland” acquired on september 13 2011 and john varvatos enterprises inc “john varvatos” sold on april 30 2012 all per share amounts are presented on a diluted basis 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

analysis of results of operations 

consolidated statements of income 

the following table presents a summary of the changes in total revenues during the last two years 

 

 vf reported revenue growth of 15 in 2012 and 23 in 2011 every coalition achieved organic growth in both years adjusting for the impact of the john varvatos sale in the contemporary brands coalition as discussed in the “information by business segment” section below the outdoor  action sports coalition reported the most significant revenue increases in 2012 and 2011 driven by the acquisition of timberland and organic growth 

translating a foreign entity’s financial statements from its functional currency into the us dollar vf’s reporting currency has an impact on vf’s reported operating results a stronger us dollar in relation to the functional currencies of those countries where vf conducts its international business primarily in europeeurobased countries negatively impacted revenue comparisons by 1698 million in 2012 relative to 2011 while a weaker us dollar positively impacted revenue comparison by 998 million in 2011 compared to 2010 the weighted average translation rates for the euro were 128 139 and 133 per euro for 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively if the us dollar remains at the exchange rate that was in effect at the end of december 2012 131 per euro reported revenues in 2013 would be positively impacted compared with 2012 

the following table presents the percentage relationship to total revenues for components of the consolidated statements of income 

 

 gross margin improved to 465 in 2012 compared to 458 in 2011 this improvement is primarily due to the continued shift in the revenue mix towards higher margin businesses including outdoor  action sports international and directtoconsumer the margin comparisons in 2012 were negatively impacted by 02 from benefits in 2011 that did not recur in 2012 related to the gain on facility closure and change in the inventory accounting policy discussed below 

the decline in gross margin to 458 in 2011 from 467 in 2010 was driven by a 19 net negative impact from higher product costs that were not fully offset by pricing increases this decline was partially offset by an increased percentage of revenues coming from higher margin businesses including outdoor  action sports international and directtoconsumer in addition the 2011 gross margin benefited by 03 from i the gain on closure of a european jeanswear facility ii the change in the inventory accounting policy discussed in note a to the consolidated financial statements and iii restructuring expenses incurred during 2010 to reduce product costs that did not recur in 2011 

  

marketing administrative and general expenses as a percentage of total revenues were higher in 2012 compared to 2011 due to the inclusion of timberland which has higher expense ratios as well as increases in pension and marketing expenses these increases were partially offset by lower timberland acquisitionrelated expenses in 2012 03 of revenue and leverage of operating expenses on higher total revenues within organic businesses 

the lower ratio of marketing administrative and general expenses as a percentage of total revenues in 2011 compared with 2010 was driven by leverage of operating expenses on higher revenues within organic businesses the 2011 ratio also included timberland acquisitionrelated expenses equal to 04 of revenue 

operating margin increased 30 basis points to 135 in 2012 from 132 in 2011 timberland negatively impacted 2012 operating margin by 90 basis points including 30 basis points from the impact of acquisitionrelated expenses timberland negatively impacted 2011 operating margin by 40 basis points including 30 basis points from the impact of acquisitionrelated expenses 

operating margin increased to 132 in 2011 from 107 in 2010 this comparison is positively impacted by 260 basis points from an impairment charge in 2010 that did not recur in 2011 the 2011 year includes a 40 basis point negative impact due to the inclusion of timberland in 2011 

vf performs impairment testing for goodwill and indefinitelived trademark intangible assets each year based on the results of the impairment tests performed management concluded that no impairment charges were required in 2012 or 2011 in 2010 vf recorded a 2017 million 1418 million net of related income tax benefits noncash impairment charge to reduce the carrying values of goodwill and trademark intangible assets of the 7 for all mankind ® brand to their respective estimated fair values for additional information see notes g and t to the consolidated financial statements and the “critical accounting policies and estimates” section below 

net interest expense increased 175 million to 903 million in 2012 due primarily to i the issuance of 9000 million of term debt in 2011 to fund the timberland acquisition and ii higher average levels of commercial paper borrowings throughout 2012 net interest expense decreased 26 million in 2011 from 2010 due primarily to i the repayment of 2000 million of longterm notes that matured in late 2010 ii higher interest rates earned on cash and equivalents held in foreign jurisdictions offset by iii incremental interest expense on short and longterm borrowings to fund the timberland acquisition 

outstanding interestbearing debt averaged 25 billion for 2012 17 billion for 2011 and 11 billion for 2010 with shortterm borrowings representing 250 240 and 40 of average debt outstanding for the respective years the weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt was 37 for 2012 45 for 2011 and 66 for 2010 the weighted average interest rate decreased in 2012 primarily due to the full year inclusion of the lower average interest rates on the 9000 million term debt issued in 2011 to fund the timberland acquisition the decrease in the weighted average interest rate in 2011 resulted from the partial year inclusion of the lower average interest rates on the 9000 million term debt noted above along with lower weighted average interest rates on commercial paper and international borrowings 

other income expense net was income of 469 million in 2012 as compared to expense of 72 million in 2011 due primarily to a 420 million gain on the sale of vf’s 80 ownership in john varvatos the remainder of the increase in 2012 was primarily due to foreign currency exchange gains 

other income expense net was expense of 72 million in 2011 compared to income of 48 million in 2010 the change from 2011 compared to 2010 was due to higher foreign currency exchange losses in 2011 in addition to the recognition of a 57 million gain in 2010 from the acquisition of the remaining 50 ownership of vans latinoamericana sa de cv “vans mexico” 

  

  

the effective income tax rate for 2012 was 236 which is approximately the same effective tax rate as 2011 included in the 2012 tax rate is a net 20 million discrete tax expense and income tax benefits from changes to valuation allowances for capital and operating loss carryforwards of 150 million and 180 million respectively these discrete items together lowered the 2012 annual tax rate by 22 the 2011 effective income tax rate of 236 included a net 42 million in discrete tax benefits related to unrecognized tax benefits and interest and a net 121 million in income tax benefits from changes to valuation allowances for operating loss carryforwards these items together lowered the 2011 annual tax rate by 14 

without discrete items the effective income tax rate for 2012 increased by approximately 08 when compared with 2011 this increase was primarily the result of 2012 tax law changes in the us partially offset by a higher percentage of income in lower tax rate jurisdictions compared with 2011 the international effective tax rate was 136 and 141 for years 2012 and 2011 respectively 

the effective income tax rate for 2011 was 236 compared to 249 in 2010 excluding the tax impact related to impairment charges the 2011 income tax rate included a tax benefit of 14 for the discrete items discussed above the 2010 income tax rate included 236 million of tax benefits related to prior years refund claims which lowered the 2010 annual tax rate by 25 in addition the 2011 effective tax rate benefited from a higher percentage of income in lower tax rate jurisdictions compared with 2010 

as a result of the american tax relief act of 2012 signed into law in january 2013 vf expects to record a tax benefit of approximately 80 million in the first quarter of 2013 primarily related to retroactive extension of certain tax credits and other provisions of the internal revenue code to the beginning of 2012 inclusive of this discrete item vf expects the 2013 annual tax rate should approximate 240 

net income attributable to vf corporation in 2012 increased to 11 billion 970 per share compared with 8881 million 798 per share in 2011 the increase in earnings per share in 2012 resulted primarily from improved operating performance as discussed in the “information by business segment” section below in addition earnings per share in 2012 benefited by a 049 per share incremental contribution from the timberland acquisition 087 per share contribution in 2012 compared to 038 per share in 2011 other factors impacting earnings per share in 2012 included the 032 per share gain on the sale of john varvatos and the negative effects of 032 per share from foreign currency translation and 019 per share from higher pension expense 

net income attributable to vf corporation in 2011 increased to 8881 million 798 per share compared with 5714 million 518 per share in 2010 the increase in earnings per share in 2011 primarily resulted from improved operating performance as discussed in the “information by business segment” section below in addition earnings per share in 2011 benefited by i 038 per share from the timberland acquisition ii 014 per share from foreign currency translation iii 009 per share in restructuring expenses in 2010 that did not recur in 2011 iv 007 per share from the gain on a facility closure and v 004 per share from a change in inventory accounting 

information by business segment 

management at each of the coalitions has direct control over and responsibility for its revenues and operating income hereinafter termed “coalition revenues” and “coalition profit” respectively vf management evaluates operating performance and makes investment and other decisions based on available opportunities and analysis of coalition revenues and coalition profit common costs such as information systems processing retirement benefits and insurance are allocated to the coalitions based on appropriate metrics such as usage or number of employees 

  

the following tables present a summary of the changes in coalition revenues and coalition profit during the last two years 

 

 the following section discusses changes in revenues and profitability by coalition 

outdoor  action sports 

 

   

the outdoor  action sports coalition includes the following brands the north face ®  timberland ®  vans ®  kipling ® outside of north america napapijri ®  reef ®  eastpak ®  jansport ®  smartwool ®  lucy ® and eagle creek ®  

the outdoor  action sports coalition achieved record revenues in 2012 with an increase of 29 over 2011 of this increase 10 related to organic growth which is net of a 3 negative impact from foreign currency translation and 19 related to the addition of timberland in addition the north face ® and vans ® brands achieved global revenue growth of 9 and 23 respectively foreign currency translation negatively impacted revenues by 1179 million in 2012 

domestic revenues increased 21 in 2012 with 12 percentage points of the increase coming from the timberland acquisition international revenues rose 37 in 2012 reflecting 11 organic growth net of a 6 negative impact from foreign currency translation and 26 growth due to the inclusion of timberland directtoconsumer revenues rose 37 in 2012 with 23 percentage points of the growth from the timberland acquisition the directtoconsumer businesses of the north face ® and vans ® brands increased 13 and 18 respectively in 2012 new store openings comp store growth and an expanding ecommerce business all contributed to the directtoconsumer revenue growth 

global revenues increased 42 in 2011 over 2010 reflecting 20 organic growth and 22 growth from the timberland acquisition domestic revenues increased 31 over 2010 and international revenues rose 63 with approximately onehalf of the growth in each of the geographies coming from the timberland acquisition of the 30 increase in international organic revenues 6 was attributable to foreign currency translation 

nearly all outdoor  action sports brands achieved doubledigit revenue growth in 2011 with the north face ® and vans ® achieving global revenue growth of 21 and 23 respectively revenues of the kipling ®  eastpak ®  reef ® and napapijri ® brands increased 24 21 17 and 15 respectively directtoconsumer revenues in the coalition rose 44 in 2011 over 2010 with approximately 25 percentage points of the increase from the timberland acquisition the directtoconsumer businesses of the north face ® and vans ® brands increased 26 and 17 respectively in 2011 new store openings comp store growth and an expanding ecommerce business all contributed to the directtoconsumer revenue growth 

the decrease in operating margin for 2012 compared with 2011 was due to the inclusion for the full year of timberland which has a lower operating margin than the overall vf average 

operating margins declined in 2011 compared with 2010 due primarily to the addition of timberland 

jeanswear 

 

 the jeanswear coalition consists of the global jeanswear businesses led by the wrangler ® and lee ® brands 

global jeanswear revenues increased 2 in 2012 over 2011 led by 5 revenue growth in the domestic business the increase in domestic revenues was due primarily to growth in the mass and western specialty businesses as well as in our newest brand rock and republic ®  offsetting a decline in the lee ® brand revenues 

  

due to continued softness in the midtier channel in the us international jeanswear revenues decreased by 4 in 2012 due to weak economic conditions in europe and a 2 436 million negative impact from foreign currency translation this decrease was partially offset by revenue increases in asia reflecting strong wholesale growth 

domestic jeanswear revenues increased 4 in 2011 over 2010 with unit pricing contributing to 8 revenue growth offset by a 4 reduction in unit volumes the domestic jeanswear growth was led by increases in the western specialty and lee ® businesses of 11 and 8 respectively mass market revenues in 2011 were flat with 2010 levels international jeanswear revenue growth in 2011 was 17 of which 3 was due to the impact of foreign currency translation asia revenues rose by 37 and mexico canada and latin america each had doubledigit growth european jeanswear revenues increased 6 with approximately twothirds of the increase attributable to favorable foreign currency translation 

operating margin improved in 2012 over 2011 primarily driven by lower product costs operating margin in 2011 included 04 from the gain on a facility closure 

the decline in operating margin in 2011 from 2010 was driven by higher product costs that were not fully offset by pricing increases within the domestic jeanswear businesses the operating margin in 2011 benefited 04 from the gain on a facility closure in 2011 and 04 from restructuring expenses in 2010 that did not recur in 2011 

imagewear 

 

 the imagewear coalition consists of vf’s image business occupational apparel and uniforms including the red kap ® and bulwark ® brand businesses and licensed sports business licensed high profile athletic apparel which includes the majestic ® brand business 

the increase in coalition revenues for 2012 was primarily attributable to a 6 increase in the image business due to growth in the government and public safety and industrial uniform businesses revenues in the licensed sports business increased 3 in 2012 due to expansion in the harley davidson collegiate and national basketball association businesses 

the image business revenues increased 19 in 2011 over 2010 driven by strength in the protective apparel and industrial uniform businesses revenues in the licensed sports business rose 6 due to continued growth in the national football league licensed apparel business including positive response to an expanded women’s apparel offering 

the decline in operating margin in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to higher product costs that negatively impacted the business during the first three quarters of 2012 

the improvement in operating margin in 2011 over 2010 resulted from a more favorable mix of business and leverage of operating expenses on higher revenues 

sportswear 

 

   

the sportswear coalition consists of the nautica ® and kipling ® brand businesses in north america the kipling ® brand outside of north america is managed by the outdoor  action sports coalition 

sportswear revenues rose 6 in 2012 compared with 2011 reflecting 5 growth of nautica ® brand revenues and 17 growth of kipling ® brand revenues these revenue increases are primarily attributable to doubledigit growth in the directtoconsumer businesses of both brands 

nautica ® brand revenues increased 5 in 2011 over 2010 with unit pricing driving the majority of the growth revenues increased in both the nautica ® men’s wholesale sportswear and directtoconsumer businesses kipling ® brand revenues increased 56 reflecting significant growth in both the wholesale and directtoconsumer businesses 

operating margin increased in 2012 compared to 2011 due to improved performance in both the wholesale and directtoconsumer businesses 

operating margin was flat in 2011 compared with 2010 as a result of higher product costs in nautica ®  offset by a greater percentage of kipling ® revenues which have higher margins than the coalition average and leverage of operating expenses on higher revenues 

contemporary brands 

 

 the contemporary brands coalition consists of the 7 for all mankind ® brand of premium denim jeanswear and related apparel and the splendid ® and ella moss ® apparel brands the john varvatos ® luxury apparel collection for men was in this coalition until it was sold on april 30 2012 

adjusting for the sale of john varvatos coalition revenues increased 5 in 2012 compared to 2011 the revenue increase was driven by growth in the splendid ® and ella moss ® brands on a combined basis of 18 domestic revenues for the 7 for all mankind ® brand increased 4 in 2012 revenues for 7 for all mankind ® in europe decreased 6 net of an 8 negative impact from foreign currency translation this 2 net increase is due to growth in the directtoconsumer businesses in addition revenues from the directtoconsumer businesses in this coalition adjusted for the sale of john varvatos expanded by 15 in 2012 due to new stores comp store revenue growth and higher ecommerce revenues 

domestic and international revenues rose 11 and 8 in 2011 over 2010 respectively with doubledigit revenue growth in the splendid ®  ella moss ® and john varvatos ® brands global 7 for all mankind ® revenues increased 4 in 2011 over 2010 with growth both domestically and internationally new stores comp store revenue growth and higher ecommerce revenues drove 34 growth in directtoconsumer revenues in 2011 

operating margin increased in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to a reduction in the sales of excess inventories for the 7 for all mankind ® brand and a greater percentage of revenues from the higher margin directtoconsumer businesses 

the improvement in operating margin in 2011 compared with 2010 resulted from i a lower more normalized volume of distressed inventory sales ii the writeoff of leasehold improvements at eight 

  

underperforming stores in 2010 that did not recur in 2011 and iii strong comp store sales performance these increases were partially offset by investments in new retail stores and increased marketing spending 

other 

 

 vf outlet ® stores in the united states sell vf and other branded products revenues and profits of vf products sold in these stores are reported as part of the operating results of the applicable coalition while revenues and profits of nonvf products are reported in the “other” category revenues increased 13 in 2012 over 2011 due to better comp store performance an expansion of nonvf product offerings and the opening of additional outlet stores in 2012 

reconciliation of coalition profit to consolidated income before income taxes 

the following costs are necessary to reconcile total coalition profit to income before income taxes 

 

  

  

  

 information systems and shared services 

these costs include management information systems and the centralized finance supply chain human resources directtoconsumer and customer management functions that support worldwide operations operating costs of information systems and shared services are charged to the coalitions based on utilization of those services costs to develop new computer applications are generally not allocated to the coalitions the increase in information systems and shared services costs in 2012 from 2011 resulted from the overall growth of the businesses increased information systems spending related to the integration of timberland and costs associated with other software implementations and upgrades the increase in 2011 from 2010 resulted from the overall growth of the businesses increased spending related to reconfiguring the western hemisphere sourcing organization and costs associated with changing thirdparty data center providers 

corporate headquarters’ costs 

headquarters’ costs include compensation and benefits of corporate management and staff legal and professional fees and administrative and general expenses which are not allocated to the coalitions the increase 

  

in corporate headquarters’ costs in 2012 over 2011 was driven by increases in compensation incremental costs related to the integration of timberland and investments in strategy and innovation the increase in 2011 over 2010 resulted from expenses associated with the timberland acquisition and higher levels of corporate spending to support overall business growth 

other 

this category includes i costs of corporate programs or corporatemanaged decisions that are not allocated to the coalitions ii adjustments for the lifo method of inventory valuation prior to 2011 iii costs of registering maintaining and enforcing certain of vf’s trademarks and iv miscellaneous consolidated costs the most significant of which is related to the expense of vf’s centrallymanaged us defined benefit pension plans the current year service cost component of pension expense is allocated to the coalitions while the remaining cost components totaling 672 million for 2012 338 million for 2011 and 469 million for 2010 are reported in corporate and other expenses offsetting the increased costs for 2012 was a 420 million gain on the sale of john varvatos and a decrease in compensation expense other expenses in 2011 were reduced by 80 million from an inventory accounting change from lifo to fifo and in 2010 were reduced by a 57 million gain related to the acquisition of vans mexico see also notes a b m and q to the consolidated financial statements 

analysis of financial condition 

balance sheets 

the discussion below addresses certain december 2012 balance sheet accounts compared to the december 2011 balances 

the net increase in accounts receivable at december 2012 over december 2011 was driven primarily by increases in revenues reduced by a 120 million increase in balances sold under the accounts receivable sale program described in the “liquidity and cash flows” section below 

inventories decreased at december 2012 from december 2011 primarily due to the impact of management’s ongoing focus on inventory reduction 

other current assets at december 2012 decreased from december 2011 due to lower levels of unrealized gains on hedging contracts 

property plant and equipment at the end of 2012 increased from december 2011 as a result of higher than normal capital expenditures in 2012 related to an exceptional number of significant capital projects to support vf’s current trend and continued expectations for high revenue growth including i a new european headquarters ii a new us headquarters for the outdoor  action sports businesses iii new distribution facilities and iv a higher number of retail store openings than in the prior year 

total intangible assets and goodwill decreased at december 2012 from december 2011 due to the amortization of intangible assets and the impact of foreign currency translation additionally goodwill decreased by 200 million during 2012 as a result of adjustments to finalize the timberland purchase price allocation 

the decrease in shortterm borrowings at december 2012 from december 2011 is due to the repayment during 2012 of all outstanding commercial paper 

the change in accounts payable between december 2012 and december 2011 was driven by the timing and level of inventory purchases and payments to vendors 

the increase in accrued liabilities at december 2012 from december 2011 was primarily due to increases in accrued income taxes related to higher earnings 

  

other liabilities at december 2012 were higher than december 2011 primarily due to an increase in the underfunded status of the defined benefit pension plans at the end of 2012 as discussed in the following paragraph partially offset by lower deferred income tax balances 

the funded status of the defined benefit pension plans is reflected in the balance sheet as the excess or deficiency of pension plan assets compared with projected benefit obligations payable to plan participants the underfunded status of the defined benefit pension plans was 4829 million at the end of 2012 compared with 4027 million at the end of 2011 this decline in the funded status was due to a reduction in the discount rate used to value the projected benefit obligations partially offset by a 1000 million discretionary contribution in december 2012 see the “critical accounting policies and estimates” section below and note m to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the defined benefit pension plans 

liquidity and cash flows 

the financial condition of vf is reflected in the following 

 

 for the ratio of debt to total capital debt is defined as shortterm and longterm borrowings and total capital is defined as debt plus stockholders’ equity the ratio of net debt to total net capital with net debt defined as debt less cash and equivalents and total net capital defined as total capital less cash and equivalents was 196 at december 2012 and 282 at december 2011 

vf’s primary source of liquidity is its strong cash flow provided by operating activities which is dependent on the level of net income as well as changes in accounts receivable inventories and other working capital components cash flow from operations was 13 billion in 2012 11 billion in 2011 and 10 billion in 2010 net income was 11 billion 8904 million and 5735 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

changes in operating assets and liabilities net of purchases and sales of businesses resulted in a 348 million net usage of cash in 2012 compared with a 1651 million net usage of cash in 2011 and 904 million of cash generation in 2010 the net usage of cash in 2012 was primarily driven by the decreases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities at december 2012 as discussed in the “balance sheets” section above and the payment of a 1000 million discretionary pension plan contribution in december 2012 

vf has an agreement with a financial institution to sell selected trade accounts receivable on a recurring nonrecourse basis under the agreement up to 2375 million of accounts receivable may be sold to the financial institution and remain outstanding at any point in time accounts receivable sold under this program which remained outstanding at december 2012 and 2011 were 1274 million and 1154 million respectively 

cash used for investing activities in the last three years related primarily to acquisitions and capital expenditures capital expenditures were 2519 million in 2012 compared with 1709 million in 2011 and 1116 million in 2010 capital expenditures in 2012 related to an exceptional number of significant projects to support vf’s current trend and continued expectations for high revenue growth including i a new european headquarters ii a new us headquarters for the outdoor  action sports businesses iii new distribution facilities and iv new retail stores capital expenditures for 2011 and 2010 primarily related to retail store openings distribution network and information systems costs vf expects that capital spending could reach 3250 million in 2013 to support continued growth including new distribution centers across the globe and continued store growth this spending is expected to be funded by cash flow from operations 

cash paid for acquisitions net of cash balances in the acquired companies was 23 billion and 383 million in 2011 and 2010 respectively the 2011 acquisition of timberland was funded by the issuance of 

  

9000 million of term debt together with cash on hand and shortterm borrowings the 2010 acquisition of vans mexico was funded with existing vf cash balances 

vf relies on continued strong cash generation to finance its ongoing operations in addition vf has significant liquidity from its available cash balances and credit facilities vf maintains a 125 billion senior unsecured revolving line of credit the “global credit facility” which supports our 125 billion us commercial paper program for shortterm seasonal working capital requirements the global credit facility expires in december 2016 as of december 2012 there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding and the entire amount of the global credit facility was available for borrowing except for 197 million of standby letters of credit issued on behalf of vf 

in august 2011 vf issued 9000 million of term debt to provide funding for the timberland acquisition the debt was comprised of 5000 million of 350 fixed rate notes due in 2021 and 4000 million of floating rate notes due in 2013 the floating rate notes bear interest at the threemonth libor rate plus 75 which resets quarterly 

vf’s favorable credit agency ratings allow for access to additional capital at competitive rates at the end of 2012 vf’s longterm debt ratings were ‘a minus’ by standard  poor’s ratings services and ‘a3’ by moody’s investors service and commercial paper ratings were ‘a2’ and ‘prime2’ respectively by those rating agencies currently both standard  poor’s and moody’s have ‘negative outlooks’ as a result of increased debt levels taken on to fund vf’s acquisition of timberland none of vf’s longterm debt agreements contain acceleration of maturity clauses based solely on changes in credit ratings however if there were a change in control of vf and as a result of the change in control the 2013 2017 2021 and 2037 notes were rated below investment grade by recognized rating agencies vf would be obligated to repurchase the notes at 101 of the aggregate principal amount of notes repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest 

during 2012 2011 and 2010 vf purchased 20 million 01 million and 51 million shares respectively of its common stock in open market transactions the respective cost was 2997 million 74 million and 4118 million with an average price of 14850 in 2012 9980 in 2011 and 8111 in 2010 fewer shares were repurchased in 2011 due to the funding of the timberland acquisition under its current authorization from the board of directors vf may purchase an additional 45 million shares vf will continue to evaluate future share repurchases considering funding required for business acquisitions common stock price and levels of stock option exercises 

cash dividends totaled 303 per common share in 2012 compared with 261 in 2011 and 243 in 2010 the dividend payout rate was 312 of diluted earnings per share in 2012 327 in 2011 and 469 in 2010 the current indicated annual dividend rate for 2013 is 348 per share 

as of december 2012 approximately 1681 million of cash and shortterm investments was held by international subsidiaries whose undistributed earnings are considered permanently reinvested vf’s intent is to reinvest these funds in international operations if management decides at a later date to repatriate these funds to the us vf would be required to provide taxes on these amounts based on applicable us tax rates net of foreign taxes already paid 

  

following is a summary of vf’s contractual obligations and commercial commitments at the end of 2012 that will require the use of funds 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 vf had other financial commitments at the end of 2012 that are not included in the above table but may require the use of funds under certain circumstances 

 

  

  

 management believes that vf’s cash balances and funds provided by operating activities as well as unused bank credit lines additional borrowing capacity and access to capital markets taken as a whole provide 

  

i adequate liquidity to meet all of its current and longterm obligations when due ii adequate liquidity to fund capital expenditures and to maintain the dividend payout policy and iii flexibility to meet investment opportunities that may arise 

vf does not participate in transactions with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships established to facilitate offbalance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes 

risk management 

vf is exposed to risks in the ordinary course of business management regularly assesses and manages exposures to these risks through operating and financing activities and when appropriate by i taking advantage of natural hedges within vf ii purchasing insurance from commercial carriers or iii using derivative financial instruments some potential risks are discussed below 

insured risks 

vf selfinsures a substantial portion of employee group medical worker’s compensation vehicle property director and officer and general liability exposures and purchases insurance from highlyrated commercial carriers for losses in excess of retained exposures 

cash and equivalents risks 

vf had 5975 million of cash and equivalents at the end of 2012 which includes demand deposits institutional money market funds that invest in obligations issued or guaranteed by the us or foreign governments and shortterm time deposits in foreign commercial banks management continually monitors the credit ratings of the financial institutions with whom vf conducts business similarly management monitors the credit quality of cash equivalents and fixed income investments in the defined benefit pension plan portfolio 

defined benefit pension plan risks 

vf has defined benefit pension plans that have risk associated with their investment portfolios at the end of 2012 vf’s pension plans were underfunded by 4829 million which is recorded as a liability on the consolidated balance sheet vf has made significant cash contributions in recent years to improve the funded status of the plans including discretionary contributions of 1000 million in both 2010 and 2012 in addition vf made another discretionary contribution of 1000 million in january 2013 vf will continue to evaluate the funded status and future funding requirements of these plans which depends in part on the future performance of the plans’ investment portfolios management believes that vf has sufficient liquidity to make any required contributions to the pension plans in future years 

vf’s reported earnings are subject to risks due to the volatility of its pension expense pension expense has ranged from 566 million to 927 million over the last three years with the fluctuations due primarily to varying amounts of actuarial gains and losses that are deferred and amortized to future years’ expense the assumptions that impact actuarial gains and losses include the rate of return on investments held by the pension plans the discount rate used to value participant liabilities and demographic characteristics of the participants 

vf has taken several steps to reduce the risk and volatility in the pension plans and their impact on the financial statements beginning in 2005 vf’s us defined benefit plans were closed to new entrants which did not affect the benefits of existing plan participants at that date or their accrual of future benefits in march 2012 the investment strategy of the us defined benefit plan was modified to more closely align characteristics of the 

  

plan’s assets relative to plan liabilities and to implement dynamic asset allocation targets dependent upon changes in the plan’s funded ratio capital market expectations and risk tolerance management will continue to evaluate actions that may help to reduce vf’s risks related to its defined benefit plans 

interest rate risks 

vf limits the risk of interest rate fluctuations by managing the mix of fixed and variable interest rate debt in addition vf may use derivative financial instruments to manage risk since a significant portion of vf’s longterm debt has fixed interest rates the exposure primarily relates to changes in interest rates on variable rate shortterm borrowings and the 4000 million of floating rate notes due 2013 which together averaged 10 billion outstanding during 2012 however any change in interest rates would also affect interest income earned on vf’s cash equivalents based on the average amount of variable rate borrowings and cash equivalents during 2012 the effect on reported net income of a hypothetical 10 change in interest rates is less than 55 million 

foreign currency exchange rate risks 

vf is a global enterprise subject to the risk of foreign currency fluctuations approximately 37 of vf’s revenues in 2012 were generated in international markets most of vf’s foreign businesses operate in functional currencies other than the us dollar if the us dollar strengthened relative to the euro or other foreign currencies where vf has operations there would be a negative impact on vf’s operating results upon translation of those foreign operating results into the us dollar vf does not hedge the translation of foreign currency operating results into the us dollar however management does hedge foreign currency transactions as discussed later in this section 

the reported values of assets and liabilities in these foreign businesses are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates most net advances to and investments in vf’s foreign businesses in europe latin america and asia are considered to be longterm and accordingly the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on those longterm advances are deferred as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders’ equity the us dollar value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries fluctuates with changes in the underlying functional currencies vf generally does not hedge this balance sheet translation exposure 

vf monitors net foreign currency market exposures and enters into derivative foreign currency contracts to hedge the effects of exchange rate fluctuations for a significant portion of forecasted foreign currency cash flows or specific foreign currency transactions relating to crossborder inventory purchases production costs product sales and intercompany royalty payments vf’s practice is to buy or sell primarily us dollar contracts against various currencies for periods of up to 20 months currently vf uses only forward exchange contracts but may use options or collars in the future this use of financial instruments allows management to reduce the overall exposure to risks from exchange rate fluctuations on vf’s cash flows and earnings since gains and losses on these contracts will offset losses and gains on the cash flows or transactions being hedged 

for cash flow hedging contracts outstanding at the end of 2012 if there were a hypothetical change in foreign currency exchange rates of 10 compared with rates at the end of 2012 it would result in a change in fair value of those contracts of approximately 1310 million however any change in the fair value of the hedging contracts would be offset by a change in the fair value of the underlying hedged exposure impacted by the currency rate changes 

counterparty risks 

vf is exposed to creditrelated losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to derivative hedging instruments to manage this risk we have established counterparty credit guidelines and only enter into derivative transactions with financial institutions with ‘a minusa3’ investment grade credit ratings or better vf continually monitors the credit rating of and limits the amount hedged with each counterparty additionally management utilizes a portfolio of financial institutions to minimize exposure to potential counterparty defaults 

  

and will adjust positions if necessary vf also monitors counterparty risk for derivative contracts within the defined benefit pension plans 

commodity price risks 

vf is exposed to market risks for the pricing of cotton leather rubber wool and other materials which we either purchase directly or in a converted form such as fabric or shoe soles to manage risks of commodity price changes management negotiates prices in advance when possible vf has not historically managed commodity price exposures by using derivative instruments 

deferred compensation and related investment security risks 

vf has nonqualified deferred compensation plans in which liabilities to the plans’ participants are based on the market values of hypothetical portfolios of investment funds selected by the participants the risk of changes in the market values of the participants’ investment selections is hedged by vf’s investment in a portfolio of securities that substantially mirrors the participants’ investment selections increases and decreases in deferred compensation liabilities are substantially offset by corresponding increases and decreases in the market value of vf’s investments resulting in an insignificant net exposure to operating results and financial position 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

vf has chosen accounting policies that management believes are appropriate to accurately and fairly report vf’s operating results and financial position in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states vf applies these accounting policies in a consistent manner significant accounting policies are summarized in note a to the consolidated financial statements 

the application of these accounting policies requires that vf make estimates and assumptions about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses contingent assets and liabilities and related disclosures these estimates assumptions and judgments are based on historical experience current trends and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis because vf’s business cycle is relatively short ie from the date that an order is placed to manufacture or purchase inventory until that inventory is sold and the trade receivable is collected actual results related to most estimates are known within a few months after any balance sheet date in addition vf may retain outside specialists to assist in valuations of business acquisitions impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets equity compensation pension benefits and selfinsured liabilities if actual results ultimately differ from previous estimates the revisions are included in results of operations in the period in which the actual amounts become known 

vf believes the following accounting policies involve the most significant management estimates assumptions and judgments used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements or are the most sensitive to change from outside factors management has discussed the application of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 

inventories 

vf’s inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value cost includes all material labor and overhead costs incurred to manufacture or purchase the finished goods overhead allocated to manufactured product is based on the normal capacity of plants and does not include amounts related to idle capacity or abnormal production inefficiencies market value is based on a detailed review at each business unit at least quarterly of all inventories on the basis of individual styles or individual stylesizecolor stockkeeping units “skus” to identify slow moving or excess products discontinued and tobediscontinued products and offquality merchandise this review matches inventory on hand plus current production and purchase 

  

commitments with current and expected future sales orders for those units in inventory that are identified as slowmoving excess or offquality vf estimates their market value based on historical experience and current realization trends this evaluation performed using a systematic and consistent methodology requires forecasts of future demand market conditions and selling prices if the forecasted market value on an individual style or sku basis is less than cost vf provides an allowance to reflect the lower value of that inventory this methodology recognizes inventory exposures on an individual style or sku basis at the time such losses are evident rather than at the time goods are actually sold historically these estimates of future demand and selling prices have not varied significantly from actual results due to vf’s timely identification and rapid disposal of these reduced value inventories 

physical inventory counts are taken on a regular basis vf provides for estimated inventory losses that have likely occurred since the last physical inventory date historically physical inventory shrinkage has not been significant vf also conducts cycle counts at many locations throughout the year 

longlived assets 

vf allocates the purchase price of an acquired business to the fair values of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed with any excess purchase price recorded as goodwill vf evaluates fair value using three valuation techniques — the replacement cost market and income methods — and weights the valuation methods based on what is most appropriate in the circumstances the process of assigning fair values particularly to acquired intangible assets is highly subjective 

vf’s depreciation policies for property plant and equipment reflect judgments on their estimated economic lives and residual value if any vf’s amortization policies for intangible assets reflect judgments on the estimated amounts and duration of future cash flows expected to be generated by those assets in evaluating expected benefits to be received for customerrelated intangible assets management considers historical attrition patterns for various groups of customers for licenserelated intangible assets management considers historical trends and anticipated license renewal periods based on experience in renewing or extending similar arrangements regardless of whether there are explicit renewal provisions 

vf reviews property and definitelived intangible assets for possible impairment on an ongoing basis to determine if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable vf tests for possible impairment at the asset or asset group level which is the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent vf measures recoverability of the carrying value of an asset or asset group by comparison with estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if the forecasted total of undiscounted cash flows exceeds the carrying value of the asset there is no impairment charge if the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset vf estimates the fair value of the asset based on the present value of its future cash flows and recognizes an impairment charge for the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its estimated fair value 

indefinitelived intangible assets consisting of major trademarks and trade names and goodwill are not subject to amortization rather vf evaluates those assets for possible impairment as of the beginning of the fourth quarter as part of the annual strategic planning process or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable the financial accounting standards board “fasb” recently issued updates to their authoritative guidance regarding goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing the updated guidance permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform quantitative impairment testing if an entity determines that it is not more likely than not that the estimated fair value of an asset is less than its carrying value then no further testing is required otherwise impairment testing must be performed in accordance with the original accounting standards as discussed in the following paragraphs 

  

fair value of an indefinitelived trademark intangible asset is based on an income approach using the relieffromroyalty method under this method forecasted global revenues for products sold with the trademark are assigned a royalty rate that would be charged to license the trademark in lieu of ownership from an independent party and fair value is the present value of those forecasted royalties avoided by owning the trademark if the estimated fair value of the trademark intangible asset exceeds its carrying value there is no impairment charge if the estimated fair value of the trademark is less than its carrying value an impairment charge would be recognized for the difference 

the carrying value of goodwill at each reporting unit is assessed for recoverability using the twostep approach reporting units are either coalitions or a business unit if discrete financial information is available and reviewed by coalition management two or more reporting units may be aggregated for impairment testing if they have similar economic characteristics in the first step of the goodwill impairment test vf compares the carrying value of a reporting unit including its recorded goodwill to the estimated fair value of the reporting unit vf estimates the fair value of a reporting unit using both incomebased and marketbased valuation methods the principal method used is an incomebased method in which the reporting unit’s forecasted future cash flows are discounted to their present value in the marketbased valuation method the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is estimated using multiples of revenues and of earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” for i a group of comparable public companies and ii recent transactions if any involving comparable companies based on the range of estimated fair values developed from the income and marketbased methods vf determines the estimated fair value for the reporting unit if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value the goodwill is not impaired and no further review is required however if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value vf performs the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the impairment charge if any the second step involves a hypothetical allocation of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its net tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill as if the reporting unit were newly acquired which results in an implied fair value of the goodwill the amount of the impairment charge is the excess of the recorded goodwill over the implied fair value of the goodwill 

the incomebased fair value methodology requires management’s assumptions and judgments regarding economic conditions in the markets in which vf operates and conditions in the capital markets many of which are outside of management’s control at the reporting unit level fair value estimation requires management’s assumptions and judgments regarding the effects of overall economic conditions on the specific reporting unit along with assessment of the reporting unit’s strategies and forecasts of future cash flows forecasts of individual reporting unit cash flows involve management’s estimates and assumptions regarding 

 

  

  

 under the marketbased fair value methodology judgment is required in evaluating market multiples and recent transactions management believes that the assumptions used for its impairment tests are representative of those that would be used by market participants performing similar valuations of vf’s reporting units 

  

in its fourth quarter 2012 intangible asset impairment testing vf adopted the fasb guidance that permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform quantitative impairment testing vf elected to perform a qualitative assessment for goodwill at all reporting units except splendid ® and ella moss ® and for trademark intangible assets at all reporting units except splendid ® and ella moss ® and 7 for all mankind ®  management did not elect to perform a qualitative analysis for the splendid ® and ella moss ® and 7 for all mankind ® reporting units based on the results of previous impairment testing 

vf performed a step one analysis on goodwill and a fair value assessment of the trademark intangible asset at the splendid ® and ella moss ® reporting unit and determined that the estimated fair value exceeded the carrying value by a significant amount in each case accordingly management concluded that the goodwill and trademark intangible assets for the splendid ® and ella moss ® reporting unit are not impaired 

additionally vf performed a fair value assessment of the trademark intangible asset at the 7 for all mankind ® reporting unit and determined that the estimated fair value exceeded the carrying value by approximately 18 compared to 4 in 2011 a portion of the original value of this intangible asset was impaired as part of the 2010 analysis and was written down from a carrying value of 3118 million to fair value of 3052 million at that time the financial results for this business in 2011 and 2012 have approximated the planned results and the expected future growth of the business beyond 2012 has not changed significantly accordingly these results are consistent with management’s expectation that the estimated fair value of the 7 for all mankind ® trademark intangible assets would not greatly exceed the carrying value all goodwill related to the 7 for all mankind ® reporting unit was written off as part of the 2010 impairment analysis 

for all other reporting units vf elected to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the goodwill and trademark intangible assets in those reporting units were impaired in this qualitative assessment vf considered relevant events and circumstances for each reporting unit including i overall financial performance including management’s five year forecast current and prior year balance sheets and actual to budgeted performance ii industry and market conditions in which the reporting unit operates iii macroeconomic conditions including any deterioration of general conditions and iv changes in products or services offered by the reporting unit we also compared the carrying values of these assets against the fair value results from the most recent testing noting that the fair value significantly exceeded carrying value in each case based on the results of the qualitative assessment vf concluded that it was not more likely than not that the carrying values of the goodwill and trademark intangible assets were greater than the fair values and that further quantitative testing was not necessary 

it is possible that vf’s conclusions regarding impairment or recoverability of goodwill or intangible assets in any reporting unit could change in future periods if for example i the businesses do not perform as projected ii overall economic conditions in 2013 or future years vary from current assumptions including changes in discount rates iii business conditions or strategies for a specific reporting unit change from current assumptions iv investors require higher rates of return on equity investments in the marketplace or v enterprise values of comparable publicly traded companies or actual sales transactions of comparable companies were to decline resulting in lower multiples of revenues and ebitda a future impairment charge for goodwill or intangible assets could have a material effect on vf’s consolidated financial position or results of operations 

stock options 

vf uses a lattice optionpricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees and nonemployee members of the board of directors vf believes that a lattice model provides a refined estimate of the fair value of options because it can incorporate i historical option exercise patterns and multiple assumptions about future option exercise patterns for each of several groups of option holders and ii inputs that vary over time such as assumptions for interest rates and volatility management performs an annual review of 

  

all assumptions employed in the valuation of option grants and believes they are reflective of the outstanding options and underlying common stock and of groups of option participants the lattice valuation is based on the assumptions listed in note o to the consolidated financial statements 

one of the critical assumptions in the valuation process is estimating the expected average life of the options before they are exercised for each option grant vf estimated the expected average life based on evaluations of the historical and expected option exercise patterns for each of the groups of option holders that have historically exhibited different option exercise patterns these evaluations included i voluntary stock option exercise patterns based on a combination of changes in the price of vf common stock and periods of time that options are outstanding before exercise and ii involuntary exercise patterns resulting from turnover retirement and mortality 

volatility is another critical assumption requiring judgment management based its estimates of future volatility on a combination of implied and historical volatility implied volatility was based on shortterm 6 to 9 months publicly traded nearthemoney options on vf common stock vf measures historical volatility over a ten year period corresponding to the contractual term of the options using daily stock prices management’s assumption for valuation purposes was that expected volatility starts at a level equal to the implied volatility and then transitions to the historical volatility over the remainder of the ten year option term 

pension obligations 

vf sponsors a qualified defined benefit pension plan covering most fulltime us employees hired before 2005 and an unfunded supplemental defined benefit plan that provides benefits in excess of the limitations imposed by income tax regulations vf also sponsors defined benefit plans covering selected international employees the selection of actuarial assumptions for determining the projected pension benefit liabilities and annual pension expense is significant due to amounts involved and the long time period over which benefits are accrued and paid 

management reviews annually the principal economic actuarial assumptions summarized in note m to the consolidated financial statements and modifies them based on current rates and trends vf also periodically reviews and modifies as necessary other plan assumptions such as rates of compensation increases retirement termination disability and mortality vf believes the assumptions appropriately reflect the participants’ demographics and projected benefit obligations of the plans and result in the best estimate of the plans’ future experience actual results may vary from the actuarial assumptions used 

one of the critical assumptions used in the actuarial model is the discount rate this discussion of discount rate and the discussion of return on assets in the next paragraph relate specifically to the us pension plans which comprise approximately 93 of plan assets and projected benefit obligations of the combined us and international plans the discount rate is used to estimate the present value of future cash outflows necessary to meet projected benefit obligations it is the estimated interest rate that vf could use to settle its projected benefit obligations at the valuation date the discount rate assumption is based on current market interest rates vf selects the discount rate by matching high quality corporate bond yields to the timing of projected benefit payments to participants in the us pension plans vf uses the population of us corporate bonds rated ‘aa’ by moody’s investors service or if a moody’s rating is not available bonds rated ‘aa’ by two other recognized rating services from this population of over 500 such bonds having at least 500 million outstanding that are noncallablenonputable unless with makewhole provisions vf excluded the highest and lowest yielding bonds the plans’ projected benefit payments are matched to current market interest rates over the expected payment period and a present value is developed that produces a single discount rate that recognizes the plans’ distinct liability characteristics vf believes that those ‘aa’ rated issues meet the “high quality” intent of the applicable accounting standards and that the 2012 discount rate of 405 appropriately reflects current market conditions and the longterm nature of projected benefit payments to participants in the us pension plans this lower 

  

discount rate compared with the rate of 510 at the end of 2011 reflects the general decline in yields of us government obligations and high quality corporate bonds during 2012 the discount rate for the plans may differ from the rates used by other companies because of longer expected duration of benefit payments reflecting i the higher percentage of female participants who generally have a longer life expectancy than males and ii the higher percentage of inactive participants who will not begin receiving vested benefits for many years 

another critical assumption of the actuarial model is the expected longterm rate of return on investments vf’s investment objective is to invest in a diversified portfolio of assets with an acceptable level of risk to maximize the longterm return while minimizing volatility of the value of plan assets relative to value of plan liabilities these risks include market interest rate credit liquidity and foreign securities risks investment assets consist of domestic and international equity corporate and governmental fixed income real estate and commodity securities vf develops a projected rate of return for each of the investment asset classes based on many factors including recent and historical returns the estimated inflation rate the premium to be earned in excess of a riskfree return the premium for equity risk and the premium for longer duration fixed income securities the weighted average projected longterm rates of return of the various assets held by the qualified plan provide the basis for the expected longterm rate of return actuarial assumption vf’s rate of return assumption was 750 in 2012 and 775 in both 2011 and 2010 in recent years vf has altered the investment mix to improve investment performance by i increasing the allocation to fixed income investments and reducing the allocation to equity investments ii increasing the allocation in equities to more international investments and iii adding commodities as an asset class the changes in asset allocation are anticipated to over time reduce the yeartoyear variability of the domestic plan’s funded status and resulting pension expense based on an evaluation of market conditions and projected market returns vf will be using a rate of return assumption of 700 for the us plan for 2013 management monitors the plan’s asset allocation to balance anticipated investment returns with risk 

differences between actual results and the respective actuarially determined assumed results eg investment performance discount rates and other assumptions in a given year do not affect that year’s pension expense but instead are deferred as unrecognized actuarial gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheet at the end of 2012 there were 6764 million of accumulated pretax deferred actuarial losses plus 75 million of deferred prior service costs resulting in an after tax amount of 4205 million in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the 2012 consolidated balance sheet these deferred losses will be amortized as a component of future years’ pension expense 

pension expense recognized in the financial statements was 927 million in 2012 566 million in 2011 and 676 million in 2010 this compares with the cost of pension benefits actually earned by covered active employees commonly called “service cost” of 232 million in 2012 209 million in 2011 and 181 million in 2010 pension expense for the last three years was significantly higher than the annual service cost because those years included the cost of amortizing prior years’ unrecognized actuarial losses as discussed in the preceding paragraph looking forward vf expects 2013 pension expense to decrease to approximately 891 million primarily due to discretionary funding in 2012 and early 2013 partially offset by an increase in amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses due to a decrease in discount rate and a decrease in expected return on assets 

the sensitivity of changes in actuarial assumptions on 2012 pension expense and on projected benefit obligations at the end of 2012 all other factors being equal is illustrated by the following 

 

   

as discussed in the “risk management” section above vf has taken several steps to reduce the risk and volatility in the pension plans and their impact on the financial statements on a longerterm basis vf believes the yeartoyear variability of the retirement benefit expense should decrease 

income taxes 

as a global company vf is subject to income taxes and files income tax returns in over 100 domestic and foreign jurisdictions each year the calculation of income tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations which are subject to legal interpretation and significant management judgment 

vf’s income tax returns are regularly examined by federal state and foreign tax authorities and those audits may result in proposed adjustments vf has reviewed all issues raised upon examination as well as any exposure for issues that may be raised in future examinations vf has evaluated these potential issues under the “morelikelythannot” standard of the accounting literature a tax position is recognized if it meets this standard and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized such judgments and estimates may change based on audit settlements court cases and interpretation of tax laws and regulations income tax expense could be materially affected to the extent vf prevails in a tax position or when the statute of limitations expires for a tax position for which a liability for unrecognized tax benefits or valuation allowances has been established or to the extent vf is required to pay amounts greater than the established liability for unrecognized tax benefits vf does not currently anticipate any material impact on earnings from the ultimate resolution of income tax uncertainties there are no accruals for general or unknown tax expenses 

vf has 1281 million of deferred income tax assets related to operating loss and capital loss carryforwards and 937 million of valuation allowances against those assets realization of deferred tax assets related to operating loss and capital loss carryforwards is dependent on future taxable income in specific jurisdictions the amount and timing of which are uncertain and on possible changes in tax laws if management believes that vf will not be able to generate sufficient taxable income or capital gains to offset losses during the carryforward periods vf records valuation allowances to reduce those deferred tax assets to amounts expected to be ultimately realized in addition vf has 60 million of valuation allowances against deferred income tax assets unrelated to operating loss and capital loss carryforwards if in a future period management determines that the amount of deferred tax assets to be realized differs from the net recorded amount vf would record an adjustment to income tax expense in that future period 

vf has not provided us income taxes on a portion of the foreign subsidiaries’ undistributed earnings because these earnings are permanently reinvested in the respective foreign jurisdictions if vf decided to remit those earnings to the united states in a future period the provision for income taxes could increase in that period 

cautionary statement on forwardlooking statements 

from time to time vf may make oral or written statements including statements in this annual report that constitute “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of the federal securities laws these include statements concerning plans objectives projections and expectations relating to vf’s operations or economic performance and assumptions related thereto

known or unknown risks uncertainties and other factors that could cause the actual results of operations or financial condition of vf to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forwardlooking statements are summarized in item 1a of this annual report

jeanswear coalition 

our jeanswear coalition markets jeanswear and related casual products in the united states and in many international markets the largest of these brands the lee ® and wrangler ® brands have longstanding traditions as authentic american jeans brands as they were established in 1889 and 1947 respectively and have strong market positions lee ® and wrangler ® products are sold in nearly every developed country through a combination of wholesale accounts vfoperated and partnership stores and online through our brands’ websites products also include shorts casual pants knit and woven tops and outerwear which are designed to complement the jeanswear products and extend our brands we also market jeanswear and related casual products under the lee casuals ® and timber creek by wrangler ® brands 

in domestic markets lee ® branded products are sold primarily through midtier department stores and specialty stores wrangler ® westernwear is marketed primarily through western specialty stores the wrangler ®  rustler ® and riders ® by lee ® brands are marketed to mass merchant and regional discount stores based on available data we believe our key brands have been gaining market share despite significant competitive activity in all channels where they are distributed including all of our jeanswear brands we believe vf has the largest unit market share of jeans in the united states and is one of the largest marketers of jeans in the world 

our advanced vendormanaged inventory and retail floor space management programs with many of our major retailer customers give us a competitive advantage in our domestic jeanswear business we receive pointofsale information from these customers on a daily or weekly basis at an individual store and stylesizecolor stockkeeping unit “sku” level we then ship products based on that customer data to ensure their selling floors are appropriately stocked with products that match their shoppers’ needs our systems capabilities allow us to analyze our retail customers’ sales demographic and geographic data to develop product assortment recommendations that maximize the productivity of their jeanswear selling space and optimize their inventory investment 

jeanswear in most international markets is more fashionoriented and has a higher selling price than similar products in the united states the international jeans market is also more fragmented than the united states market with competitors ranging from global brands to a number of smaller brands marketed in a specific country or region 

  

vf’s largest international jeanswear businesses are located in western europe and asia lee ® and wrangler ® jeanswear products are sold through department stores and specialty stores where we employ similar retail floor space management programs to those described above we also market lee ® and wrangler ® products to mass market department and specialty stores in canada and mexico as well as to department stores and specialty stores in asia and south america in many international markets we are expanding our reach through vfoperated stores which are an important vehicle for presenting our brands’ image and marketing message directly to consumers we are continuing to expand our jeanswear brands in emerging markets and have experienced significant growth in china and india in foreign markets where vf does not have owned operations lee ® and wrangler ® products are marketed through distributors agents and licensees some of whom operate over 700 independently operated single brand or multibrand stores primarily in eastern europe and asia 

in the united states we believe our jeanswear coalition is growing its jeans market share in the mass market western specialty and national chain channels of distribution through superior consumer insight and marketing strategies and continuous product innovation internationally growth will be driven by expansion of our existing businesses in asia where we have reported a compounded annual revenue growth rate in excess of 25 over the last three years with india growing at a rate of 45 in 2011

directtoconsumer operations 

vfoperated stores are part of our longterm strategy to drive revenue growth and increase profitability our full price stores allow us to showcase a brand’s full line of current season products with fixtures and imagery that support the brand’s positioning these stores provide high visibility for our brands and products and enable us to stay close to the needs and preferences of our consumers the proper presentation of products in our stores particularly in our showcase stores also helps to increase consumer purchases of vf products sold through our wholesale customers vfoperated full price stores generally provide gross margins and operating margins that are higher than vf averages and a return on investment well above vf averages in addition vf operates outlet stores in both premium outlet malls and more traditional valuebased locations these outlet stores serve an important role in our overall inventory management and profitability by allowing vf to sell a significant portion of excess discontinued and outofseason products at better prices than are otherwise available from outside parties while maintaining the integrity of our brands 

our growing global retail operations include 1053 stores at the end of 2011 of that total there are 976 single brand stores ie primarily one brand’s product offerings in each store that sell the north face ®  timberland ®  vans ®  nautica ®  7 for all mankind ®  lucy ®  splendid ®  lee ®  wrangler ®  napapijri ®  john varvatos ®  kipling ®  and eastpak ®  we also operate 77 vf outlet stores in the united states that sell a broad selection of excess quantities of vfbranded products as well as women’s intimate apparel childrenswear other apparel and accessories approximately 70 of vfoperated stores offer products at full price and the remainder are outlet locations approximately 65 of our stores are located in the united states with the remaining stores located in europe latin america and asia

total retail store and ecommerce revenues accounted for 19 of vf’s consolidated total revenues in 2011 and 18 in 2010 we expect our directtoconsumer business to continue to grow at a faster pace than vf’s overall growth rate as we continue opening stores and expanding our ecommerce presence during 2011 we opened 121 stores and acquired 188 timberland ® stores we are planning to open approximately 130 new retail locations in 2012 for 2012 capital investments in retail stores of approximately 86 million will be concentrated where we see higher retail growth potential — vans ®  the north face ®  7 for all mankind ® and international 

in addition our licensees distributors and other independent parties own and operate over 1900 partnership stores which are primarily monobrand stores selling vfbranded products these stores — most of which are in eastern europe and asia — are focused on the north face ®  timberland ®  kipling ®  nautica ®  lee ® and wrangler ® brands 

licensing arrangements 

as part of our business strategy of expanding market penetration of vfowned brands we may enter into licensing agreements for specific apparel and complementary product categories if such arrangements with independent parties can provide more effective manufacturing distribution and marketing of such products than could be achieved internally we provide support to these business partners and ensure the integrity of our brand names by taking an active role in the design quality control advertising marketing and distribution of licensed products 

licensing arrangements relate to a broad range of vf brands license agreements are for fixed terms of generally three to five years with conditional renewal options each licensee pays royalties to vf based on its sales of licensed products with most agreements providing for a minimum royalty requirement royalties generally range from 5 to 8 of the licensing partners’ net licensed products sales gross royalty income was 940 million in 2011 primarily from the nautica ®  timberland ®  vans ®  the north face ®  john varvatos ®  lee ® and wrangler ® brands in addition licensees of our brands are generally required to spend from 1 to 5 of their net licensed product sales to advertise vf’s products in some cases these advertising amounts are remitted to vf for advertising on behalf of the licensees 

vf has also entered into license agreements to use trademarks owned by third parties we market apparel under licenses granted by major league baseball the national football league the national basketball association the national hockey league harleydavidson motor company inc major colleges and universities and individual athletes and related organizations most of which contain minimum annual royalty and advertising requirements 

manufacturing sourcing and distribution 

product design fit fabric finish and quality are important in all of our businesses these functions are performed by employees located in either our global supply chain organization or our branded business units across the globe 

vf’s centralized global supply chain organization sources product and is responsible for delivering products to our customers vf is highly skilled in managing the complexities associated with our global supply chain on an annual basis vf sources or produces over 400 million units spread across 36 brands vf operates 

  

29 manufacturing facilities and typically utilizes about 2100 contractor manufacturing facilities in over 60 countries we operate approximately 30 distribution centers and 1053 retail stores managing this complexity is made possible by the use of sophisticated information systems technologies — with sophisticated systems for product development forecasting order management and warehouse management attached to our core enterprise resource management platforms 

in 2011 31 of our units were manufactured in vfowned facilities and 69 were obtained from independent contractors primarily in asia products manufactured in vf facilities generally have a lower cost and shorter lead times than contracted production products obtained from contractors in the western hemisphere generally have a higher cost than products obtained from contractors in asia but contracting in the western hemisphere gives us greater flexibility shorter lead times and allows for lower inventory levels this combination of vfowned and contracted production along with different geographic regions and cost structures provides a wellbalanced approach to product sourcing we will continue to manage our supply chain from a global perspective and adjust as needed to changes in the global production environment 

vf operates manufacturing facilities located in mexico central and south america the caribbean europe and the middle east a significant percentage of denim bottoms and occupational apparel are manufactured in these plants as well as a smaller percentage of annual footwear requirements for these owned production facilities we purchase raw materials from numerous domestic and international suppliers to meet our production needs raw materials include products made from cotton leather rubber wool synthetics and blends of cotton and synthetic yarn as well as thread and trim product identification buttons zippers snaps eyelets and laces in some instances we contract the sewing of vfowned raw materials into finished product with independent contractors manufacturing in the united states includes all major league baseball uniforms along with screen printing and embroidery of jerseys tshirts and fleece products fixed price commitments for fabric and certain supplies are generally set on a quarterly basis for the next quarter’s purchases no single supplier represents more than 5 of our total cost of sales 

independent contractors generally own the raw materials and ship finished readyforsale products to vf these contractors are engaged through vf sourcing hubs in hong kong with satellite offices across asia and panama these hubs are responsible for coordinating the manufacturing and procurement of product supplier management product quality assurance transportation and shipping functions in the eastern and western hemispheres respectively substantially all products in the outdoor  action sports and sportswear coalitions as well as a portion of products for our jeanswear and imagewear coalitions are obtained through these sourcing hubs for most products in our contemporary brands coalition we contract the sewing and finishing of vfowned raw materials through a network of independent contractors based in the united states 

management continually monitors political risks and developments related to duties tariffs and quotas we limit vf’s sourcing exposure through among other measures i extensive geographic diversification with a mix of vfoperated and contracted production ii shifts of production among countries and contractors iii sourcing production to merchandise categories where product is readily available and iv sourcing from countries with tariff preference and free trade agreements vf does not directly or indirectly source products from suppliers in countries identified by the state department as state sponsors of terrorism and subject to us economic sanctions and export controls 

all vfowned production facilities throughout the world as well as all independent contractor facilities that manufacture vfbranded products must comply with vf’s global compliance principles these principles established in 1997 and consistent with international labor standards are a set of strict standards covering legal and ethical business practices workers’ ages work hours health and safety conditions environmental standards and compliance with local laws and regulations in addition our owned factories must also undergo certification by the independent nonprofit organization worldwide responsible accredited production “wrap” which promotes global ethics in manufacturing vf through its contractor monitoring program audits the activities of the independent businesses and contractors that produce vfbranded goods at locations across the globe each of 

  

the over 2100 independent contractor facilities including those serving our independent licensees must be precertified before producing any vf products this precertification includes passing a factory inspection and signing a vf terms of engagement agreement we maintain an ongoing audit program to ensure compliance with these requirements by using dedicated internal staff and externally contracted firms additional information about vf’s code of business conduct global compliance principles terms of engagement factory compliance guidelines factory audit procedure and environmental compliance guidelines along with a global compliance report is available on the vf website at wwwvfccom 

despite higher demand for raw materials and contracted production vf did not experience difficulty in filling its raw material and contracting production needs during 2011 and does not anticipate any difficulty in 2012 we believe that we will be able to remain cost competitive in 2012 due to our scale and significance to our suppliers further vf believes it will be able to offset the majority of higher product costs through i increases in the prices of its products ii the continuing shift in the mix of its business to higher margin brands geographies and channels of distribution and iii cost reduction opportunities the loss of any one supplier or contractor would not have a significant adverse effect on our business 

product is shipped from our independent suppliers and vfoperated manufacturing facilities to distribution centers in the united states and international locations in limited instances product is shipped directly to our customers product is inspected stocked and stored in our distribution centers until needed for packing and shipping to our wholesale customers or our stores most distribution centers are operated by vf and some support more than one brand our distribution centers use computercontrolled inventory management technology for efficient tracking moving and shipping of products a portion of our distribution needs are met by contract distribution centers 

seasonality 

vf’s operating results vary from quartertoquarter throughout the year due to the differing sales patterns of our individual businesses on a quarterly basis and excluding the effect of acquisitions consolidated total revenues for 2011 ranged from a low of 21 of full year revenues in the second quarter to a high of 30 in the third quarter while consolidated operating income ranged from a low of 16 in the second quarter to a high of 35 in the third quarter this variation results primarily from the seasonal influences on revenues of our outdoor  action sports coalition where 19 of the coalition’s revenues occurred in the second quarter and 33 in the third quarter of 2011 with changes in our mix of business and growth of our retail operations historical quarterly revenue and profit trends may not be indicative of future trends we expect the portion of annual revenues and profits occurring in the second half of the year to continue to increase 

working capital requirements vary throughout the year working capital increases during the first half of the year as inventory builds to support peak shipping periods and then decreases during the second half of the year as those inventories are sold and accounts receivable are collected cash provided by operating activities is substantially higher in the second half of the year due to higher net income during that period and reduced working capital requirements particularly during the fourth quarter 

advertising and customer support 

during 2011 our advertising and promotion spending was 540 million representing 57 of net sales we advertise in consumer and trade publications on national and local radio on television and on the internet we also participate in cooperative advertising on a shared cost basis with major retailers in print media radio and television we sponsor a number of athletes and personalities who promote our products as well as sporting musical and special events we employ marketing sciences to optimize the impact of advertising and promotional spending and to identify the types of spending that provide the greatest return on our marketing investments 

  

we provide pointofsale fixtures and signage to our wholesale customers to enhance the presentation and brand image of our products we utilize shopinshops which are separate sales areas dedicated to a specific vf brand within our customers’ stores to help differentiate and enhance the presentation of our products we participate in concession arrangements with department store customers in china and other international markets in a typical concession arrangement the department store provides a dedicated sales area while vf owns and bears the risk of inventory ownership 

we participate in incentive programs with our retailer customers including discounts allowances and cooperative advertising funds we also offer sales incentive programs directly to consumers in the form of rebate and coupon offers 

in addition to sponsorships and activities that directly benefit our products and brands vf and its associates actively support our communities and various charities for example our the north face ® brand has committed to programs that encourage and enable outdoor participation such as planet explore wwwplanetexplorecom the never stop exploring award and the explore your parks program the timberland ® brand has a heritage of volunteerism including the path of service™ program that offers fulltime employees up to 40 hours of paid time off a year to serve their local communities timberland also sponsors two annual global service events earth day in the spring and servapalooza in the fall when employees provide assistance to local communities through various volunteer efforts the nautica ® brand supports oceana a notforprofit organization focused on ocean conservation in addition 2011 marked the sixteenth year of support for lee national denim day ®  one of the country’s largest singleday fundraisers for breast cancer that has raised over 86 million to fight breast cancer since its inception vf also supports companywide sustainability efforts and recognizes the “vf 100” as a means of honoring the 100 vf associates worldwide having the highest number of volunteer service hours during the year

 item 1a risk factors 

the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating vf’s business and the forwardlooking statements contained in this form 10k any of the following risks could materially adversely affect vf’s business its operating results and its financial condition 

vf’s revenues and profits depend on the level of consumer spending for apparel which is sensitive to general economic conditions a decline in consumer spending could have a material adverse effect on vf 

the apparel industry has historically been subject to cyclical variations and is particularly affected by adverse trends in the general economy the success of vf’s business depends on consumer spending and there are a number of factors that influence consumer spending including actual and perceived economic conditions disposable consumer income interest rates availability of credit housing costs stock market performance extreme weather conditions energy prices and tax rates in the international national regional and local markets where vf’s products are sold consumer spending advanced at a relatively slow pace during 2011 and 2010 following the recessionary conditions of 2008 and early 2009 a decline in actual or perceived economic conditions or other factors could negatively impact the level of consumer spending and have a material adverse impact on vf 

the effects of a return to recessionary conditions could have a material adverse effect on vf 

the global recession — with rising unemployment reduced availability of credit increased savings rates and declines in real estate and securities values — had and is continuing to have a negative impact on retail sales of apparel and other consumer products reduced sales at our wholesale customers may lead to lower retail inventory levels reduced orders to vf or order cancellations these lower sales volumes along with the possibility of restrictions on access to the credit markets may result in our customers experiencing financial difficulties including store closures bankruptcies or liquidations this may result in higher credit risk relating to receivables from our customers who are experiencing these financial difficulties if these developments occur our inability to shift sales to other customers or to collect on vf’s trade accounts receivable could have a material adverse effect on vf’s financial condition and results of operations 

a growing portion of our revenues are directtoconsumer through vfoperated stores and ecommerce websites it is possible that reduced consumer confidence along with a reduction in availability of consumer credit and increasing unemployment could lead to a reduction in our directtoconsumer sales channel this could have a material adverse effect on vf’s financial condition and results of operations 

fluctuations in the price availability and quality of raw materials and finished goods could increase costs 

fluctuations in the price availability and quality of fabrics leather or other raw materials used by vf in its manufactured products or of purchased finished goods could have a material adverse effect on vf’s cost of sales or its ability to meet its customers’ demands the prices we pay depend on demand and market prices for the raw materials used to produce them with the price of cotton currently having a significant negative impact the price and availability of such raw materials may fluctuate significantly depending on many factors including crop yields energy prices weather patterns and speculation in the commodities markets prices of purchased finished products also depend on wage rates in asia and other geographic areas where our independent contractors are located as well as freight costs from those regions in the future vf may not be able to offset cost increases with other cost reductions or efficiencies or to pass higher costs on to its customers this could have a material adverse effect on vf’s results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

vf’s net sales depend on a volume of traffic to its stores and the availability of suitable lease space 

in order to generate customer traffic we locate many of our stores in prominent locations within successful retail shopping centers or in fashionable shopping districts our stores benefit from the ability of the retail center 

  

and other attractions in an area to generate consumer traffic in the vicinity of our stores we cannot control the development of new shopping centers or districts the availability or cost of appropriate locations within existing or new shopping centers or districts competition with other retailers for prominent locations or the success of individual shopping centers or districts all of these factors may impact our ability to meet our growth targets and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

part of our future growth is significantly dependent on our ability to operate stores in desirable locations with capital investment and lease costs providing the opportunity to earn a reasonable return we cannot be sure as to when or whether such desirable locations will become available at reasonable costs further if we are unable to renew or replace our existing store leases or enter into leases for new stores on favorable terms or if we violate any of the terms of our current leases our growth and profitability could be harmed these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the apparel industry is highly competitive and vf’s success depends on its ability to respond to constantly changing fashion trends and consumer demand reduced sales or prices resulting from competition could have a material adverse effect on vf 

vf competes with numerous apparel brands and manufacturers some of our competitors are larger and have more resources than vf in some product categories and regions in addition vf competes directly with the private label brands of most of its wholesale customers vf’s ability to compete within the apparel and footwear industries depends on our ability to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 if we misjudge fashion trends and market conditions we could have insufficient levels of inventory that cause us to miss opportunities to make sales or we could have significant excess inventories of products that we may have to sell at a loss failure to compete effectively or to keep pace with rapidly changing markets and trends could have a material adverse effect on vf’s business financial condition and results of operations 

vf’s results of operations could be materially harmed if we are unable to accurately forecast demand for our products 

we often schedule internal production and place orders for products with independent manufacturers before our customers’ orders are firm factors that could affect our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

if we fail to accurately forecast consumer demand we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of product required to meet the demand inventory levels in excess of consumer demand may result in inventory writedowns and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices which could have an adverse effect on vf’s results of operations and financial condition on the other hand if we underestimate demand for our products our manufacturing facilities or third party manufacturers may not be able to produce products to meet consumer requirements and this could result in delays in the shipment of products and lost revenues as well as damage to vf’s reputation and relationships there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully manage inventory levels to meet our future order requirements 

a substantial portion of vf’s revenues and gross profit is derived from a small number of large customers the loss of any of these customers could substantially reduce vf’s revenues and profits 

a few of vf’s customers account for a significant portion of revenues sales to vf’s ten largest customers were 23 of total revenues in fiscal 2011 with walmart stores inc accounting for 9 of revenues sales to our customers are generally on a purchase order basis and not subject to longterm agreements a decision by any of vf’s major customers to significantly decrease the volume of products purchased from vf could substantially reduce revenues and have a material adverse effect on vf’s financial condition and results of operations moreover in recent years the retail industry has experienced consolidation and other ownership changes in the future retailers may further consolidate undergo restructurings or reorganizations realign their affiliations or reposition their stores’ target markets these developments could result in a reduction in the number of stores that carry vf’s products increase ownership concentration within the retail industry increase credit exposure or increase leverage over their suppliers these changes could impact vf’s opportunities in the market and increase vf’s reliance on a smaller number of large customers 

vf’s profitability may decline as a result of increasing pressure on margins 

the apparel industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors including intense competition consolidation in the retail industry pressure from retailers to reduce the costs of products and changes in consumer demand if these factors cause us to reduce our sales prices to retailers and consumers and we fail to sufficiently reduce our product costs or operating expenses vf’s profitability will decline this could have a material adverse effect on vf’s results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

vf may not succeed in its growth strategy 

one of our key strategic objectives is growth we seek to grow through both organic growth and acquisitions by building new growing lifestyle brands expanding our share with winning customers stretching vf’s brands to new regions managing costs leveraging our supply chain and information technology capabilities across vf and expanding our directtoconsumer business including opening new stores and remodeling and expanding our existing stores we may not be able to grow our existing businesses we may have difficulty completing acquisitions and we may not be able to successfully integrate a newly acquired business or achieve the expected growth cost savings or synergies from such integration we may not be able to expand our market share with winning customers expand our brands geographically or achieve the expected results from our supply chain initiatives we may have difficulty recruiting developing or retaining qualified employees we may not be able to achieve our store expansion goals manage our growth effectively successfully integrate the planned new stores into our operations or operate our new remodeled and expanded stores profitably failure to implement our growth strategy may have a material adverse effect on vf’s business 

there are risks associated with vf’s acquisitions 

any acquisitions or mergers by vf will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of companies these risks include among other things higher than anticipated acquisition costs and expenses the difficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of the companies and the loss of key 

  

employees and customers as a result of changes in management in addition geographic distances may make integration of acquired businesses more difficult we may not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with any acquisitions 

our acquisitions may cause large onetime expenses or create goodwill or other intangible assets that could result in significant impairment charges in the future we also make certain estimates and assumptions in order to determine purchase price allocation and estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed if our estimates or assumptions used to value these assets and liabilities are not accurate we may be exposed to losses that may be material 

vf’s operations in international markets and earnings in those markets may be affected by legal regulatory political and economic risks 

our ability to maintain the current level of operations in our existing international markets and to capitalize on growth in existing and new international markets is subject to risks associated with international operations these include the burdens of complying with foreign laws and regulations unexpected changes in regulatory requirements new tariffs or other barriers in some international markets 

we cannot predict whether quotas duties taxes exchange controls or other restrictions will be imposed by the united states the european union or other countries on the import or export of our products or what effect any of these actions would have on vf’s business financial condition or results of operations we cannot predict whether there might be changes in our ability to repatriate earnings or capital from international jurisdictions changes in regulatory geopolitical policies and other factors may adversely affect vf’s business or may require us to modify our current business practices 

approximately 58 of vf’s 2011 net income was earned in international jurisdictions vf is exposed to risks of changes in us policy for companies having business operations outside the united states the president and others in his administration have proposed changes in us income tax laws that could among other things accelerate the us taxability of nonus earnings or limit foreign tax credits although such proposals have been deferred if new legislation were enacted it is possible our us income tax expense could increase which would reduce our earnings 

concerns regarding the european debt crisis market perceptions and euro instability could adversely affect vf’s business results of operations and financing 

vf generated approximately 20 of its total revenues from european countries during 2011 concerns persist regarding the debt burden of certain countries in the eurozone in particular greece italy ireland portugal and spain and their ability to meet future financial obligations as well as the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political circumstances in individual eurozone countries these concerns could lead to the reintroduction of individual currencies in one or more eurozone countries or in more extreme circumstances the possible dissolution of the euro currency entirely should the euro currency and eurozone dissolve entirely the legal and contractual consequences for holders of eurodenominated obligations would be determined by laws in effect at that time these potential developments or market perceptions concerning these and related issues could adversely affect the value of vf’s eurodenominated assets and obligations in addition concerns over the effect of this financial crisis on financial institutions in europe and globally could have an adverse impact on the capital markets generally and more specifically on the ability of vf’s customers suppliers and lenders to finance their respective businesses 

vf uses foreign suppliers and manufacturing facilities for a substantial portion of its raw materials and finished products which poses risks to vf’s business operations 

during fiscal 2011 approximately 69 of vf’s units were purchased from independent manufacturers primarily located in asia with substantially all of the remainder produced by vfowned and operated 

  

manufacturing facilities located in mexico central and south america the caribbean europe and the middle east although no single supplier and no one country is critical to vf’s production needs any of the following could impact our ability to produce or deliver vf products and as a result have a material adverse effect on vf’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our business is subject to national state and local laws and regulations for environmental employment safety and other matters the costs of compliance with or the violation of such laws and regulations by vf or by independent suppliers who manufacture products for vf could have an adverse effect on our operations and cash flows as well as on our reputation 

numerous governmental agencies enforce comprehensive federal state and local laws and regulations on a wide range of environmental employment safety and other matters vf could be adversely affected by costs of compliance with or violations of those laws and regulations in addition the costs of products purchased by vf from independent contractors could increase due to the costs of compliance by those contractors further violations of such laws and regulations could affect the availability of inventory affecting our net sales 

failure to comply with such laws and regulations as well as with ethical social product labor and environmental standards or related political considerations could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions including boycotts any negative publicity about these types of concerns may reduce demand for vf’s merchandise damage to vf’s reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on vf’s results of operations financial condition and cash flows as well as require additional resources to rebuild vf’s reputation 

if vf’s suppliers fail to use acceptable ethical business practices vf’s business could suffer 

we require third party suppliers to operate in compliance with applicable laws rules and regulations regarding working conditions employment practices and environmental compliance however we do not control the practices of our independent manufacturers if one of our independent contractors violates labor or other laws 

  

or implements labor or other business practices that are generally regarded as unethical in the united states it could impact vf’s reputation and relationships although the loss of a single supplier would not have a significant impact on our operations it could result in interruption of finished goods shipments to vf cancellation of orders by customers and termination of relationships this along with the damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on vf’s revenues and consequently its results of operations 

vf’s business is exposed to the risks of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations vf’s hedging strategies may not be effective in mitigating those risks 

a growing percentage of vf’s total revenues approximately 34 in 2011 is derived from international markets vf’s foreign businesses operate in functional currencies other than the us dollar changes in currency exchange rates may affect the us dollar value of the foreign currencydenominated amounts at which vf’s international businesses purchase products incur costs or sell products in addition for vf’s usbased businesses the majority of products are sourced from independent contractors or vf plants located in foreign countries as a result the cost of these products may be affected by changes in the value of the relevant currencies furthermore much of vf’s licensing revenue is derived from sales in foreign currencies changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse impact on vf’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in accordance with our operating practices we hedge a significant portion of our foreign currency transaction exposures arising in the ordinary course of business to reduce risks in our cash flows and earnings our hedging strategy may not be effective in reducing all risks and no hedging strategy can completely insulate vf from foreign exchange risk we do not hedge foreign currency translation rate changes 

further our use of derivative financial instruments may expose vf to counterparty risks although vf only enters into hedging contracts with counterparties having investment grade credit ratings it is possible that the credit quality of a counterparty could be downgraded or a counterparty could default on its obligations which could have a material adverse impact on vf’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

vf borrows funds on a shortterm basis primarily to support seasonal working capital requirements longterm debt is part of vf’s total capital structure because of conditions in global credit markets vf may have difficulty accessing capital markets for short or longterm financing 

particularly in 2008 and continuing to a lesser extent during the last three years global capital and credit markets have experienced extreme volatility and disruption with government intervention mergers or bankruptcies of several major financial institutions and a general decline in global liquidity many corporate issuers have been unable to access credit markets 

we typically use shortterm commercial paper borrowings to support seasonal working capital requirements with amounts generally repaid by the end of each year from strong cash flows from operations vf was able to continue to borrow in the commercial paper markets during the last three years in the future vf may seek to access the longterm capital markets to replace maturing debt obligations or to fund acquisition or other growth opportunities there is no assurance that the commercial paper markets or the longterm capital markets will continue to be reliable sources of financing for vf 

vf has a global revolving credit facility one or more of the participating banks may not be able to honor their commitments which could have an adverse effect on vf’s business 

vf has a 125 billion global revolving credit facility that expires in december 2016 if the financial markets return to recessionary conditions this could impair the ability of one or more of the banks participating in our credit agreements from honoring their commitments this could have an adverse effect on our business if we were not able to replace those commitments or to locate other sources of liquidity on acceptable terms 

  

the loss of members of vf’s executive management and other key employees could have a material adverse effect on its business 

vf depends on the services and management experience of its executive officers and business leaders who have substantial experience and expertise in vf’s business vf also depends on other key employees involved in the operation of its business competition for experienced and wellqualified personnel in the apparel industry is intense the unexpected loss of services of one or more of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on vf 

vf may be unable to protect its trademarks and other intellectual property rights 

vf’s trademarks and other intellectual property rights are important to its success and its competitive position vf is susceptible to others copying its products and infringing its intellectual property rights especially with the shift in product mix to higher priced brands and innovative new products in recent years some of vf’s brands such as the north face ®  timberland ®  vans ®  jansport ®  nautica ®  wrangler ® and lee ® brands enjoy significant worldwide consumer recognition and the higher pricing of those products creates additional risk of counterfeiting and infringement 

counterfeiting of vf’s products or infringement on its intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our brands and adversely affect vf’s revenues actions we have taken to establish and protect vf’s intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent copying of its products by others or to prevent others from seeking to invalidate its trademarks or block sales of vf’s products as a violation of the trademarks and intellectual property rights of others in addition unilateral actions in the united states or other countries including changes to or the repeal of laws recognizing trademark or other intellectual property rights could have an impact on vf’s ability to enforce those rights 

the value of vf’s intellectual property could diminish if others assert rights in or ownership of trademarks and other intellectual property rights of vf or trademarks that are similar to vf’s trademarks or trademarks that vf licenses from others we may be unable to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction in some cases there may be trademark owners who have prior rights to vf’s trademarks because the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states in other cases there may be holders who have prior rights to similar trademarks vf is from time to time involved in opposition and cancellation proceedings with respect to some of its intellectual property rights 

vf is subject to the risk that its licensees may not generate expected sales or maintain the value of vf’s brands 

during 2011 938 million of vf’s revenues were derived from licensing royalties although vf generally has significant control over its licensees’ products and advertising we rely on our licensees for among other things operational and financial controls over their businesses failure of our licensees to successfully market licensed products or our inability to replace existing licensees if necessary could adversely affect vf’s revenues both directly from reduced royalties received and indirectly from reduced sales of our other products risks are also associated with a licensee’s ability to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

in addition vf relies on its licensees to help preserve the value of its brands although we attempt to protect vf’s brands through approval rights over design production processes quality packaging merchandising distribution advertising and promotion of our licensed products we cannot completely control the use of licensed vf brands by our licensees the misuse of a brand by a licensee could have a material adverse effect on that brand and on vf 

vf has entered into license agreements to use the trademarks of others loss of a license could have an adverse effect on vf’s operating results 

vf has entered into agreements to market products under licenses granted by third parties including major league baseball the national football league and harleydavidson motor company inc some of these licenses are for a short term and do not contain renewal options loss of a license which in certain cases could result in an impairment charge for related operating and intangible assets could have an adverse effect on vf’s operating results 

vf relies significantly on information technology any inadequacy interruption integration failure or security failure of this technology could harm vf’s ability to effectively operate its business 

our ability to effectively manage and operate our business depends significantly on information technology systems the failure of these systems to operate effectively problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems difficulty in integrating new systems or systems of acquired businesses or a breach in security of these systems could adversely impact the operations of vf’s business moreover vf and its customers could suffer harm if customer information were accessed by third parties due to a security failure in vf’s systems it could also require significant expenditures to remediate any such failure problem or breach 

if vf encounters problems with its distribution system vf’s ability to deliver its products to the market could be adversely affected 

vf relies on owned or independentlyoperated distribution facilities to warehouse and ship product to its customers vf’s distribution system includes computercontrolled and automated equipment which may be subject to a number of risks related to security or computer viruses the proper operation of software and hardware power interruptions or other system failures because substantially all of vf’s products are distributed from a relatively small number of locations vf’s operations could also be interrupted by earthquakes floods fires or other natural disasters near its distribution centers we maintain business interruption insurance but it may not adequately protect vf from the adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in vf’s distribution facilities such as the longterm loss of customers or an erosion of brand image in addition vf’s distribution capacity is dependent on the timely performance of services by third parties including the transportation of product to and from its distribution facilities if we encounter problems with our distribution system our ability to meet customer expectations manage inventory complete sales and achieve operating efficiencies could be materially adversely affected 

vf’s balance sheet includes a significant amount of intangible assets and goodwill a decline in the fair value of an intangible asset or of a business unit could result in an asset impairment charge which would be recorded as an operating expense in vf’s consolidated statement of income and could be material 

we evaluate goodwill and nonamortizing trademark intangible assets for possible impairment at least annually in addition intangible assets that are being amortized are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value might not be recoverable for these impairment tests we use various valuation methods to estimate the fair value of our business units and intangible assets if the fair value of an asset is less than its carrying value we would recognize an impairment charge for the difference during 2010 we recognized 2017 million of goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges 

  

at december 2011 vf had indefinitelived intangible assets of approximately 23 billion related to trademarks and 20 billion of goodwill on its balance sheet in addition vf had approximately 06 billion of intangible assets that are being amortized goodwill and intangible assets combined represent 53 of vf’s total assets and 110 of stockholders’ equity 

it is possible that we could have an impairment charge for goodwill or trademark intangible assets in future periods if i overall economic conditions in 2012 or future years vary from our current assumptions ii business conditions or our strategies for a specific business unit change from our current assumptions iii investors require higher rates of return on equity investments in the marketplace or iv enterprise values of comparable publicly traded companies or of actual sales transactions of comparable companies were to decline resulting in lower comparable multiples of revenues and ebitda and accordingly lower implied values of goodwill and intangible assets a future impairment charge for goodwill or intangible assets could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

volatility in securities markets interest rates and other economic factors could substantially increase vf’s defined benefit pension costs 

vf currently has unfunded obligations under its defined benefit pension plans the funded status of the pension plans is dependent on many factors including returns on investment assets and the discount rate used to determine pension obligations unfavorable returns on plan assets a lower discount rate or unfavorable changes in the applicable laws or regulations could materially change the timing and amount of pension funding requirements which could reduce cash available for vf’s business 

vf’s operating performance also may be negatively impacted by the amount of expense recorded for its pension plans pension expense is calculated using actuarial valuations that incorporate assumptions and estimates about financial market economic and demographic conditions differences between estimated and actual results give rise to gains and losses that are deferred and amortized as part of future pension expense which can create volatility that adversely impacts vf’s future operating results 

vf’s directtoconsumer business includes risks that could have an adverse effect on its results 

vf sells merchandise over the internet through its websites its directtoconsumer business is subject to numerous risks that could have a material adverse effect on its results risks include but are not limited to the a diversion of sales from vf stores b difficulty in recreating the instore experience through direct channels c domestic or international resellers purchasing merchandise and reselling it overseas outside vf’s control d the failure of the systems that operate the websites and their related support systems including computer viruses theft of customer information privacy concerns telecommunication failures and electronic breakins and similar disruptions e liability for online content f credit card fraud and e risks related to vf’s directtoconsumer distribution centers vf’s failure to successfully respond to these risks might adversely affect sales in its internet business as well as damage its reputation and brands 

vf’s business and the success of its products could be harmed if vf is unable to maintain the images of its brands 

vf’s success to date has been due in large part to the growth of its brands’ images if we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to changing consumer demand the names and images of our brands may be impaired even if we react appropriately to changes in consumer preferences consumers may consider our brands’ images to be outdated or associate our brands with styles that are no longer popular in the past many apparel companies have experienced periods of rapid growth in sales and earnings followed by periods of declining sales and losses our businesses may be similarly affected in the future

analysis of results of operations 

consolidated statements of income 

the following table presents a summary of the changes in total revenues during the last two years 

 

 total revenues consist of net sales of products and royalty income from licensees revenues grew 23 in 2011 over 2010 with a 42 increase in the outdoor  action sports businesses driven by organic growth and 

  

the timberland acquisition revenues in the imagewear and contemporary brands businesses grew 13 and 11 respectively over the 2010 levels sportswear revenues in 2011 grew 9 over the prior year and jeanswear revenues increased 8 

revenues in 2010 increased 7 over 2009 with 14 growth in the outdoor  action sports businesses revenues also increased in most other businesses in 2010 but not to the same extent as the outdoor  action sports businesses additional details on revenues are provided in the section titled “information by business segment” 

translating a foreign entity’s financial statements from its functional currency into the us dollar vf’s reporting currency has an impact on vf’s reported operating results a weaker us dollar in relation to the functional currencies of those countries where vf conducts its international business primarily in europeeurobased countries positively impacted revenue comparisons by 100 million in 2011 relative to 2010 while a stronger dollar negatively impacted revenue comparisons by 21 million in 2010 relative to 2009 the weighted average translation rates for the euro were 139 133 and 139 per euro for 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively if the us dollar remains at the exchange rate in effect at the end of december 2011 130 per euro reported revenues in 2012 will be negatively impacted compared with 2011 

the following table presents the percentage relationship to total revenues for components of the consolidated statements of income 

 

 the 09 decline in gross margin rate in 2011 from 2010 was driven by a 19 net negative impact from higher product costs that were not fully offset by pricing increases which was partially offset by an increased percentage of revenues coming from higher gross margin businesses including the outdoor  action sports international and directtoconsumer businesses in addition the 2011 gross margin benefited by 03 from i the gain on closure of a european jeanswear facility in the second quarter of 2011 ii restructuring expenses incurred during the first quarter of 2010 to reduce product costs that did not recur in 2011 and iii the change in inventory accounting policy discussed in note a to the consolidated financial statements 

the gross margin rate expanded 24 in 2010 over 2009 with approximately 13 of the improvement due to i an increased percentage of revenues coming from higher gross margin businesses including the outdoor  action sports international and directtoconsumer operations and ii other areas of operational improvements including retail and inventory efficiencies the remaining 11 improvement resulted from product cost reductions 

the lower ratio of marketing administrative and general expenses as a percentage of total revenues in 2011 compared with 2010 was driven by leverage of operating expenses on higher revenues the 2011 ratio also included 04 of onetime expenses related to the timberland acquisition 

marketing administrative and general expenses as a percent of revenues increased 10 in 2010 over 2009 due to increased marketing spending in 2010 and 04 due to stronger growth in the directtoconsumer business which has a higher expense ratio to revenues than the wholesale business these increases were partially offset by lower domestic pension expense which reduced the ratio by 06 in 2010 compared with 2009 

operating margins increased to 132 in 2011 from 107 in 2010 adjusted operating margins were 135 in 2011 vs 133 in 2010 

  

vf completed its annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinitelived trademark intangible assets in the fourth quarter of 2011 as part of its strategic planning process this assessment considered current and expected economic conditions trends and forecasted business unit cash flows and assumptions representative of those that market participants would make in valuing vf’s business units based on the results of this testing vf management concluded that no impairment charges were required in 2011 as a result of an impairment review in the fourth quarter of 2010 vf management determined that the carrying values of its goodwill and trademark intangible assets at its 7 for all mankind ® business unit exceeded their respective fair values accordingly vf recorded a noncash impairment charge in 2010 totaling 2017 million 1418 million net of related income tax benefits to reduce the carrying values of goodwill and the trademark intangible assets to their fair values this charge represented all of the recorded goodwill for the 7 for all mankind ® business unit and 40 of the combined goodwill and nonamortized trademark balances for this business unit similarly as a result of vf’s annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2009 vf management determined that the carrying values of goodwill at its reef ®  lucy ® and nautica ® business units and trademark intangible assets at its reef ® and lucy ® business units exceeded their respective fair values accordingly vf recorded noncash impairment charges in 2009 totaling 1220 million 1144 million net of related income tax benefits to reduce these carrying values to their fair values of this total reef ® represented 367 million lucy ® represented 268 million and nautica ® represented 585 million 23 26 and 14 respectively of each businesses’ combined goodwill and nonamortized trademark intangible asset balances for additional information see notes f g and t to the consolidated financial statements and the “critical accounting policies and estimates” section below 

net interest expense decreased 26 million in 2011 from 2010 due primarily to i the repayment of 2000 million of longterm notes that matured in late 2010 and ii higher interest rates earned on cash and equivalents held in foreign jurisdictions offset by incremental interest expense on short and longterm borrowings to fund the timberland acquisition net interest expense decreased 83 million in 2010 from 2009 due to reduced shortterm borrowing levels and the repayment of 2000 million of notes that matured in 2010 

average interestbearing debt outstanding totaled 1656 million for 2011 1136 million for 2010 and 1364 million for 2009 with shortterm borrowings representing 240 40 and 162 of average debt outstanding for the respective years the weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt was 45 for 2011 66 for 2010 and 61 for 2009 the decrease in the weighted average interest rate in 2011 resulted from the issuance of new longterm notes commercial paper and borrowings under the international facility all bearing lower interest rates than prior issuances the increase in the weighted average interest rate in 2010 over 2009 resulted from a reduction in commercial paper borrowings which bear lower interest rates 

vf recognized a 57 million gain in miscellaneous income during 2010 from remeasuring the previous 50 investment in the vans mexico joint venture upon acquiring the remaining 50 interest the remainder of the increase in miscellaneous net expense in 2011 over 2010 was due to higher foreign currency exchange losses 

the effective income tax rate for 2011 was 236 which included 143 million in net tax benefit related to settlements of prior years’ tax audits and prior years’ tax filings 94 million of tax benefit related to the realization of unrecognized tax benefits resulting from expiration of statutes of limitations and 166 million in income tax benefit related to the release of valuation allowances in foreign jurisdictions these items together lowered the 2011 annual tax rate by 35 in addition the 2011 effective income tax rate benefited from a higher percentage of income in lower tax rate jurisdictions compared with 2010 and 2009 during 2011 the international effective tax rate was approximately 102 

the tax rates for 2009 and 2010 excluding impairment charges were 262 and 249 respectively during 2009 vf recorded a tax benefit of 175 million related to favorable outcomes of us state tax audits and from expirations of statutes of limitations in several us state and international jurisdictions where accruals for uncertain tax positions had been recorded these items lowered the 2009 annual tax rate by 23 during 

  

2010 vf recorded 205 million of tax benefit related to prior years’ refund claims and tax credits and 56 million of tax benefit related to expirations of statutes of limitations in international jurisdictions where accruals for uncertain tax positions had been recorded these items together lowered the 2010 annual tax rate by 27 the 2010 effective income tax rate benefited from a higher percentage of income in lower tax rate jurisdictions compared with 2009 

net income attributable to vf corporation for 2011 increased to 8881 million 798 per share compared with 5714 million 518 per share in 2010 adjusted earnings per share were 820 in 2011 and 646 in 2010 an increase of 27 the increase in earnings per share in 2011 resulted from improved operating performance as discussed in the “information by business segment” section below in addition earnings per share in 2011 benefited by i 038 per share from the timberland acquisition which included 022 per share in acquisitionrelated expenses ii 014 per share from the impact of foreign currency translation iii 009 per share in restructuring expenses incurred in the first quarter of 2010 that did not recur in 2011 iv 007 per share from the gain on a facility closure and v 004 per share from a change in inventory accounting 

net income attributable to vf corporation increased to 5714 million in 2010 from 4613 million in 2009 while earnings per share increased to 518 in 2010 from 413 in 2009 adjusted earnings per share were 646 in 2010 and 516 in 2009 the increase in earnings per share in 2010 over 2009 resulted from improved operating performance as discussed in the “information by business segment” section below and lower domestic pension expense which benefited earnings per share in 2010 by 020 these benefits were partially offset by cost reduction actions that negatively impacted earnings per share in 2010 by 009

 the following section discusses changes in revenues and profitability by coalition 

outdoor  action sports 

 

 this coalition consists of vf’s outdoor and action sportsrelated businesses including the north face ®  vans ®  timberland ®  kipling ®  smartwool ®  jansport ®  eastpak ®  napapijri ®  reef ®  lucy ® and eagle creek ®  

the outdoor  action sports coalition achieved record revenues and operating income in 2011 global revenues for this coalition increased 42 over 2010 reflecting 20 organic growth and 22 growth from the timberland acquisition outdoor  action sports revenues in the americas increased 31 over 2010 and international revenues rose 63 with approximately onehalf of the growth in each of the geographies coming from the timberland acquisition of the 30 increase in international organic revenues 6 was attributable to foreign currency translation nearly all outdoor  action sports brands achieved doubledigit growth in the year with the two largest brands — the north face ® and vans ® — achieving global revenue growth of 21 and 23 respectively in addition revenues of the kipling ®  eastpak ®  reef ® and napapijri ® brands increased 24 21 17 and 15 respectively coalition revenues in asia increased 93 with over 50 percentage points of the growth due to the timberland acquisition directtoconsumer revenues in the coalition rose 44 in 2011 over 2010 with approximately 25 percentage points of the increase from the timberland acquisition directtoconsumer revenue growth was also driven by new store openings comp store revenue growth and an expanding ecommerce business with increases of 26 and 17 in the north face ® and vans ® directtoconsumer businesses respectively 

the 14 increase in revenues in 2010 over 2009 was driven by growth in the north face ® and vans ® brands of 18 and 20 respectively these brands experienced growth in both domestic and international markets directtoconsumer revenues for this coalition rose 20 in 2010 over 2009 with doubledigit growth in 

  

the north face ®  vans ®  kipling ®  napapijri ® and lucy ® retail businesses as the coalition benefited from new store openings growth in comp store sales and expansion of the ecommerce business revenues in asia increased 31 in 2010 over the prior year 

operating margin declined in 2011 compared with 2010 due primarily to the timberland acquisition excluding the operating results of timberland and its acquisitionrelated expenses operating margin in 2011 was 197 compared with 199 in 2010 

the operating margin improvement in 2010 over 2009 was driven by i a 25 increase in gross margin reflecting improvements in retail store performance and improved profitability on the disposal of distressed inventories and ii leverage of operating expenses on higher revenues these operating margin improvements were partially offset by a significant increase in marketing spending that negatively impacted operating margin comparisons by 12 in 2010 compared with 2009 

jeanswear 

 

 the jeanswear coalition consists of the global jeanswear businesses led by the wrangler ® and lee ® brands 

domestic jeanswear revenues increased 4 in 2011 over 2010 with unit pricing contributing to 8 revenue growth offset by a 4 reduction in unit volumes the domestic jeanswear growth was led by increases in the western and lee ® businesses of 11 and 8 respectively mass market revenues in 2011 were flat with 2010 levels international jeanswear revenue growth in 2011 was 17 of which 3 was due to the impact of foreign currency translation asia revenues rose by 37 and mexico canada and latin america each had doubledigit growth european jeanswear revenues increased 6 with approximately twothirds of the increase attributable to favorable foreign currency translation 

domestic jeanswear revenues increased 2 in 2010 over 2009 with 3 growth in both the wrangler ® and lee ® brands reflecting the positive impact of new products introduced during the year international jeanswear revenues including europe canada mexico latin america and asia declined 3 in 2010 with lower revenues in europe partially offset by 36 revenue growth in asia and doubledigit growth in all other foreign markets the decline in europe resulted primarily from the decision in 2009 to exit the mass market jeans business in europe as well as continued difficult business conditions in the overall european jeanswear market 

the decline in operating margin in 2011 from 2010 was driven by higher product costs that were not fully offset by pricing increases within the domestic jeanswear businesses the operating margin in 2011 benefited by 04 from the gain on a facility closure in 2011 and 04 from restructuring expenses in 2010 that did not recur in 2011 

the improvement in operating margin in 2010 over 2009 resulted from a 26 higher gross margin reflecting i lower product costs particularly in the us jeanswear businesses and ii lower levels of and improved profitability on the disposal of distressed inventories operating margin comparisons in 2010 also benefited from the 2009 exit of the european mass market jeans business which had operating margins that were well below the coalition average these benefits were partially offset by increased marketing spending and charges for cost reduction actions that negatively impacted 2010 operating margin comparisons by 08 and 04 respectively 

  

imagewear 

 

 the imagewear coalition consists of vf’s image business occupational apparel and uniforms and licensed sports business licensed high profile athletic apparel 

image business revenues increased 19 in 2011 over 2010 driven by strength in the protective apparel and industrial uniform business revenues in the licensed sports business rose 6 due to continued growth in the national football league licensed apparel business including positive response to an expanded women’s apparel offering 

image business revenues increased 8 in 2010 over 2009 due to strength in the industrial and protective sectors resulting from the gradual economic recovery and the competitive advantage of its quick response service model licensed sports revenues increased 3 in 2010 over 2009 due primarily to growth in the licensed national football league business 

the improvement in operating margin in 2011 over 2010 resulted from a more favorable mix of business which led to a higher gross margin of 08 and leverage of operating expenses on higher revenues 

operating margin increased 15 in 2010 over 2009 due to a higher gross margin resulting primarily from an improved mix of business the remainder of the increase was driven by leverage of operating expenses on higher revenues 

sportswear 

 

 the sportswear coalition consists of the nautica ® and kipling ® brand businesses in north america the kipling ® brand outside of north america is managed by the outdoor  action sports coalition 

nautica ® brand revenues increased 5 in 2011 over 2010 with unit pricing driving the majority of the growth revenues increased in both the nautica ® men’s wholesale sportswear and directtoconsumer businesses kipling ® brand revenues increased 56 reflecting significant increases in both the wholesale and directtoconsumer businesses 

sportswear coalition revenues were flat in 2010 compared with 2009 a 2 decline in nautica ® brand revenues during 2010 due to lower volume in owned outlet stores was offset by 30 growth in kipling ® brand revenues reflecting significant increases in both the wholesale and directtoconsumer businesses 

operating margin was flat in 2011 compared with 2010 due to the impact of higher product costs being offset by i a higher percentage of kipling ® revenues which have higher margins than the coalition average and ii leverage of operating expenses on higher revenues 

  

operating margin was flat in 2010 compared with 2009 gross margin improved by 07 due to i lower markdown activity in the department and outlet store channels ii lower levels of excess inventory coming into 2010 and iii a higher percentage of kipling ® revenues which have stronger margins than the coalition average the gross margin improvement was offset by increased marketing spending 

contemporary brands 

 

 this coalition consists of the 7 for all mankind ® brand of premium denim jeanswear and related apparel the john varvatos ® luxury apparel collection for men and the splendid ® and ella moss ® apparel brands 

domestic and international revenues rose 11 and 8 in 2011 over 2010 respectively with doubledigit revenue growth in the splendid ®  ella moss ® and john varvatos ® brands global 7 for all mankind ® revenues increased 4 in 2011 over 2010 with growth both domestically and internationally new stores comp store revenue growth and higher ecommerce revenues drove 34 growth in directtoconsumer revenues for this coalition in 2011 

the growth in coalition revenues in 2010 resulted from the 2009 acquisition of the splendid ® and ella moss ® brands which contributed an incremental 24 million in revenues in 2010 and 10 revenue growth in the john varvatos ® business these increases were partially offset by a 3 decrease in global 7 for all mankind ® brand revenues reflecting volume declines due to challenging conditions in the premium denim market 

the improvement in operating margin in 2011 compared with 2010 resulted from i a lower more normalized volume of distressed inventory sales ii the writeoff of fixtures at eight underperforming stores in 2010 that did not recur in 2011 and iii strong comp store sales performance these increases were partially offset by investments in new retail stores and increased marketing spending 

the decline in operating margin in 2010 compared with 2009 was driven by i investments in new 7 for all mankind ® retail stores ii increased marketing spending iii the writeoff of fixtures at eight underperforming retail stores that had been opened in previous years iv higher volumes of distressed inventory sales at lower gross margin and v the favorable resolution of a valueadded tax and duty matter during 2009 that did not recur in 2010 these decreases were partially offset by improved operating results in the john varvatos ® business which had a positive operating margin in 2010 as compared with operating losses in all prior years 

other 

 

 vf operates outlet stores in the united states that sell vf and other branded products revenues and profits of vf products sold in these stores are reported as part of the operating results of the applicable coalition while revenues and profits of nonvf products are reported in this other category revenues and profit in the other business segment for 2011 were flat with both 2010 and 2009 

  

reconciliation of coalition profit to consolidated income before income taxes 

there are three types of costs necessary to reconcile total coalition profit as discussed in the preceding paragraphs to income before income taxes these costs are as follows 

impairment of goodwill and trademarks and interest expense net were discussed in the previous “consolidated statements of income” section impairment of goodwill and trademarks is excluded from coalition profit as it represents charges that are not part of the ongoing operations of the respective businesses see the “nongaap financial information” section below interest is excluded from coalition profit because substantially all financing costs are managed at the corporate office and are not under the control of coalition management 

corporate and other expenses consists of corporate headquarters’ and similar costs that are not apportioned to the operating coalitions these expenses are summarized as follows 

 

 information systems and shared services — include the costs of management information systems and the centralized finance supply chain human resources and customer management functions that support worldwide operations operating costs of information systems and shared services are charged to the coalitions based on utilization of those services such as minutes of computer processing time number of transactions or number of users costs to develop new computer applications that will be used across vf are not allocated to the coalitions the increase in information systems and shared services costs in 2011 from 2010 resulted from the overall growth of the businesses increased spending related to reconfiguring the western hemisphere sourcing organization and costs associated with changing thirdparty data center providers 

corporate headquarters’ costs — headquarters’ costs include compensation and benefits of corporate management and staff legal and professional fees and administrative and general expenses which are not apportioned to the coalitions the increase in corporate headquarters’ costs in 2011 over 2010 resulted from expenses associated with the timberland acquisition and higher levels of corporate spending to support overall business growth the increase in 2010 from 2009 was primarily driven by higher incentive compensation increased contributions to the vf foundation and higher investments in strategy and innovation 

trademark maintenance and enforcement — include legal and other costs associated with registering maintaining and enforcing the majority of vf’s trademarks plus the costs of licensing administration these costs are controlled by a centralized trademark and licensing staff and are not allocated to the coalitions the increase in expenses in 2011 over 2010 resulted from foreign currency exchange losses on hedging contracts related to royalty arrangements 

other — this category includes i costs that result from corporate programs or corporatemanaged decisions that are not allocated to the business units for internal management reporting ii adjustments to convert the earnings of certain business units using the fifo inventory valuation method for internal reporting to the lifo method for consolidated financial reporting prior to 2011 and iii other consolidating adjustments the most significant of which is related to the expense of vf’s centrallymanaged us defined benefit pension plans coalition profit of the business units includes only their current year service cost component of pension expense pension costs totaling 338 million for 2011 469 million for 2010 and 831 million in 2009 

  

primarily representing amortization of deferred actuarial losses were recorded in “other” expenses above other expenses in 2011 were reduced by 80 million from an inventory accounting change from lifo to fifo and in 2010 were reduced by a 57 million gain related to the acquisition of vans mexico see also notes a and q to the consolidated financial statements 

analysis of financial condition 

balance sheets 

the timberland acquisition significantly impacted the december 2011 consolidated balance sheet accordingly the table below presents the december 2011 balance sheet accounts excluding the timberland balances at that date so that the remaining vf balances are comparable with the december 2010 balances 

 

 unless noted otherwise the discussion that follows relates to vf’s businesses excluding the timberland balances at december 2011 

accounts receivable at december 2011 increased over december 2010 due to significant growth in wholesale revenues near the end of the fourth quarter of 2011 in addition there was a slight increase in days’ sales outstanding compared with the prior year reflecting a higher percentage of revenues in international jurisdictions where payment terms are substantially longer than those of the us businesses 

inventories increased 12 at december 2011 over december 2010 with 9 percentage points of the increase due to higher product costs and expected revenue growth in the first quarter of 2012 compared with the prior year period 

other current assets at december 2011 increased over december 2010 due primarily to higher levels of unrealized gains on hedging contracts 

property plant and equipment at the end of 2011 was higher than at december 2010 as a result of capital spending in excess of depreciation expense 

total intangible assets and goodwill decreased at december 2011 from december 2010 due to the amortization of intangible assets and the impact of foreign currency translation 

shortterm borrowings were 2817 million at december 2011 as compared to 366 million at december 2010 due to the use of funds associated with the timberland acquisition and to support the overall growth of vf’s businesses see the “liquidity and cash flows” section below 

the increase in accounts payable at december 2011 compared with december 2010 resulted from the timing of inventory purchases and other payments 

  

the increase in accrued liabilities at december 2011 over december 2010 was driven primarily by overall growth of vf’s businesses 

longterm debt at december 2011 increased from december 2010 due to the issuance of 9000 million of term debt to provide funding for the timberland acquisition 

other liabilities increased at december 2011 from december 2010 due to an increase in the underfunded status of the defined benefit pension plans at the end of 2011 as discussed in the following paragraph partially offset by lower deferred income tax liabilities 

the funded status of the defined benefit pension plans is reflected in the balance sheet as the excess or deficiency of pension plan assets compared with projected benefit obligations payable to plan participants the underfunded status of the defined benefit pension plans recorded in other liabilities was 4027 million at the end of 2011 compared with 2074 million at the end of 2010 the funded status declined in 2011 because the plans’ projected benefit obligations grew primarily due to a decline in the discount rate used to value those liabilities while there was little earnings growth in the plans’ assets see the “critical accounting policies and estimates” section below and note m to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of liability and equity balances related to defined benefit pension plans 

liquidity and cash flows 

the financial condition of vf is reflected in the following 

 

 for the ratio of debt to total capital debt is defined as shortterm and longterm borrowings and total capital is defined as debt plus stockholders’ equity the ratio of net debt to total capital with net debt defined as debt less cash and equivalents and total capital defined as net debt plus stockholders’ equity was 282 at the end of 2011 

vf’s primary source of liquidity is its strong cash flow provided by operating activities which is dependent on the level of net income changes in accounts receivable investments in inventories and changes in other working capital components cash flow from operations was 10814 million in 2011 10013 million in 2010 and 9735 million in 2009 net income was 8904 million 5735 million and 4585 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively net income in 2010 and 2009 was negatively impacted by noncash pretax impairment charges for goodwill and intangible assets of 2017 million and 1220 million respectively 

operating cash flow for 2010 and 2009 included 1000 million and 2000 million respectively of discretionary contributions to the us qualified defined benefit pension plan which reduced cash flow from operating activities during those periods there were no discretionary contributions to this plan in 2011 vf has adequate liquidity to meet future pension funding requirements 

changes in operating assets and liabilities net of acquisitions resulted in a 1651 million net usage of cash in 2011 compared with cash generation of 904 million and 2281 million in 2010 and 2009 respectively the net usage of cash in 2011 was primarily driven by increased accounts receivable balances at the end of 2011 as discussed in the “balance sheets” section above net cash provided by operating assets and liabilities in 2010 was due to higher accruals for incentive compensation and other liabilities resulting from business growth in 2010 net cash provided by operating assets and liabilities in 2009 was driven by i a significant reduction in inventory levels ii the sale of accounts receivable discussed in the paragraph below and iii a reduction in other current assets during 2009 resulting from prepaid income taxes being unusually high at the end of 2008 

  

vf has an agreement with a financial institution to sell selected trade accounts receivable on a nonrecourse basis this agreement allows vf to have up to 2375 million of accounts receivable held by the financial institution at any point in time at the end of december 2011 and 2010 accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheets had been reduced by 1154 million and 1123 million respectively related to balances sold under this program the sale of accounts receivable under this agreement increased operating cash flow by 31 million 381 million and 742 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

cash used for investing activities in the last three years related primarily to acquisitions and capital expenditures capital expenditures were 1709 million in 2011 compared with 1116 million in 2010 and 859 million in 2009 capital expenditures in each of these years primarily related to retail store rollout distribution network and information systems costs vf expects that capital spending could reach 375 million in 2012 to support continued growth including new headquarters for the outdoor  action sports businesses in the united states and europe new distribution centers across the globe and continued store growth this spending will be funded by cash flow from operations 

cash paid for acquisitions net of cash balances in the acquired companies was 22652 million 383 million and 2123 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively the 2011 acquisition of timberland was funded by the issuance of 9000 million of term debt together with cash on hand and shortterm borrowings the 2010 and 2009 acquisitions were funded with existing vf cash balances 

vf relies on continued strong cash generation to finance its ongoing operations in addition vf has significant liquidity from its available cash balances credit facilities and strong credit rating in december 2011 vf entered into a new credit facility that provides a 125 billion senior unsecured revolving line of credit through december 2016 the “global credit facility” the global credit facility replaced the previous 10 billion senior domestic unsecured revolving facility and the €2500 million senior international unsecured revolving facility the global credit facility also supports vf’s issuance of up to 125 billion of commercial paper for shortterm seasonal working capital requirements commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of december 2011 were 2471 million at the end of december 2011 12289 million was available for borrowing under the global credit facility there was 211 million of standby letters of credit issued against the global credit facility on vf’s behalf 

in august 2011 vf issued 9000 million of term debt to provide funding for the timberland acquisition the debt was comprised of 5000 million of 350 fixed rate notes due in 2021 and 4000 million of floating rate notes due in 2013 the floating rate notes bear interest at the threemonth libor rate plus 75 which resets quarterly 

vf’s liquidity position is also enhanced by its favorable credit agency ratings which allow for access to additional capital at competitive rates at the end of 2011 vf’s longterm debt ratings were ‘a minus’ by standard  poor’s ratings services and ‘a3’ by moody’s investors service and commercial paper ratings were ‘a2’ and ‘prime2’ respectively by those rating agencies moody’s maintains a ‘stable’ outlook for vf and standard  poor’s has a ‘negative outlook’ as a result of vf’s acquisition of timberland none of vf’s longterm debt agreements contain acceleration of maturity clauses based solely on changes in credit ratings however if there were a change in control of vf and as a result of the change in control the 2013 2017 2021 and 2037 notes were rated below investment grade by recognized rating agencies then vf would be obligated to repurchase the notes at 101 of the aggregate principal amount of notes repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest 

during 2011 2010 and 2009 vf purchased 01 million 51 million and 16 million shares respectively of its common stock in open market transactions the respective cost was 74 million 4118 million and 1120 million with an average price of 9980 in 2011 8111 in 2010 and 7180 in 2009 shares repurchased in 2011 were less than prior years due to the funding of the timberland acquisition under its current authorization from the board of directors vf may purchase an additional 65 million shares vf will continue to evaluate future share repurchases considering funding required for business acquisitions common stock price and levels of stock option exercises 

  

cash dividends totaled 261 per common share in 2011 compared with 243 in 2010 and 237 in 2009 the dividend payout rate was 327 of diluted earnings per share in 2011 469 in 2010 and 574 in 2009 on a longer term basis vf expects to pay annual dividends of approximately 40 of diluted earnings per share the current indicated annual dividend rate for 2012 is 288 per share 

as of december 2011 approximately 57 million of cash and shortterm investments was held by international subsidiaries whose undistributed earnings are considered permanently reinvested vf’s intent is to reinvest these funds in international operations if management decides at a later date to repatriate these funds to the united states vf would be required to provide taxes on these amounts based on applicable us tax rates net of foreign taxes already paid 

following is a summary of vf’s contractual obligations and commercial commitments at the end of 2011 that will require the use of funds 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

vf had other financial commitments at the end of 2011 that are not included in the above table but may require the use of funds under certain circumstances 

 

  

  

 management believes that vf’s cash balances and funds provided by operating activities as well as unused bank credit lines additional borrowing capacity and access to capital markets taken as a whole provide i adequate liquidity to meet all of its current and longterm obligations when due ii adequate liquidity to fund capital expenditures and to maintain the dividend payout policy and iii flexibility to meet investment opportunities that may arise 

vf does not participate in transactions with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships established to facilitate offbalance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes 

risk management 

vf is exposed to risks in the ordinary course of business management regularly assesses and manages exposures to these risks through operating and financing activities and when appropriate by i taking advantage of natural hedges within vf ii purchasing insurance from commercial carriers or iii using derivative financial instruments some potential risks are discussed below 

insured risks — vf selfinsures a substantial portion of employee group medical worker’s compensation vehicle property director and officer and general liability exposures and purchases insurance from highlyrated commercial carriers for losses in excess of retained exposures 

cash and equivalents risks — vf had 3412 million of cash and equivalents at the end of 2011 which includes demand deposits institutional money market funds that invest in obligations issued or guaranteed by the united states or foreign governments and shortterm time deposits in foreign commercial banks management continually monitors the credit ratings of the financial institutions with whom vf conducts business similarly management monitors the credit quality of cash equivalents and fixed income investments in the defined benefit pension plan portfolio 

defined benefit pension plan risks — vf has defined benefit pension plans that have risk associated with their investment portfolio at the end of 2011 vf’s pension plans were underfunded by 4027 million which is recorded as a liability on the consolidated balance sheet vf has made significant cash contributions to improve the funded status of the plans discretionary contributions of 2000 million in 2009 and 1000 million in 2010 vf will continue to evaluate the funded status of the retirement plans and future funding requirements future funding obligations for the defined benefit plans depend on funding requirements and future performance of the plans’ investment portfolio management believes that vf has sufficient liquidity to make any required contributions to the pension plans in future years 

vf’s reported earnings are subject to risks due to the volatility of its pension expense pension expense has ranged from 566 million to 980 million over the last three years with the fluctuations due primarily to varying amounts of actuarial gains and losses ie differences between actual results incurred and actuarially assumed amounts that are deferred and amortized to future years’ expense these actuarial assumptions include the rate of return on investments held by the pension plans and the discount rate used to value participant liabilities 

  

vf has taken several steps to reduce the risk and volatility in the pension plans and their impact on the financial statements beginning in 2005 vf’s domestic defined benefit plans were closed to new entrants which did not affect the benefits of existing plan participants at that date or their accrual of future benefits as the qualified plan becomes more fully funded management’s intent is to lengthen the average duration of fixed income investments to more closely match expected benefit payments so that the effect of interest rate changes on the plan’s investments will be better correlated with the benefit obligations the investments are intended to fund in addition vf has begun settling some participants’ accrued obligations by lump sum distributions management will continue to evaluate actions that may help to reduce vf’s risks related to its defined benefit plans 

interest rate risks — vf limits the risk of interest rate fluctuations by managing the mix of fixed and variable interest rate debt in addition vf may use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk since a significant portion of vf’s longterm debt has fixed interest rates the interest rate exposure primarily relates to changes in interest rates on variable rate shortterm borrowings and the 4000 million of floating rate notes due 2013 which together averaged 5410 million outstanding during 2011 however any change in interest rates would also affect interest income earned on vf’s cash equivalents based on the average amount of variable rate borrowings and cash equivalents during 2011 the effect on reported net income of a hypothetical 10 change in interest rates would not be significant 

foreign currency exchange rate risks — vf is a global enterprise subject to the risk of foreign currency fluctuations approximately 34 of vf’s revenues in 2011 were generated in international markets most of vf’s foreign businesses operate in functional currencies other than the us dollar if the us dollar strengthened relative to the euro or other foreign currencies where vf has operations there would be a negative impact on vf’s operating results upon translation of those foreign operating results into the us dollar vf does not hedge the translation of foreign currency operating results into the us dollar however management does hedge foreign currency transactions as discussed later in this section 

the reported values of assets and liabilities in these foreign businesses are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates most net advances to and investments in vf’s foreign businesses in europe latin america and asia are considered to be longterm and accordingly foreign currency transaction effects on those longterm advances are deferred as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders’ equity vf generally does not hedge net investments in foreign subsidiaries which could cause the us dollar value of those investments to fluctuate 

vf monitors net foreign currency market exposures and enters into derivative foreign currency contracts to hedge the effects of exchange rate fluctuations for a significant portion of forecasted foreign currency cash flows or specific foreign currency transactions use of these financial instruments allows management to reduce the overall exposure to risks from exchange rate fluctuations on vf’s cash flows and earnings since gains and losses on these contracts will offset losses and gains on the cash flows or transactions being hedged vf’s practice is to hedge a portion of net foreign currency cash flows forecasted for periods of up to 20 months relating to crossborder inventory purchases production costs product sales and intercompany royalty payments by buying or selling primarily us dollar contracts against various currencies currently vf uses only forward exchange contracts but may use options or collars in the future 

for cash flow hedging contracts outstanding at the end of 2011 if there were a hypothetical change in foreign currency exchange rates of 10 compared with rates at the end of 2011 it would result in a change in fair value of those contracts of approximately 100 million however any change in the fair value of the hedging contracts would be offset by a change in the fair value of the underlying hedged exposure impacted by the currency rate changes 

counterparty risks — vf is exposed to creditrelated losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to derivative hedging instruments to manage this risk we have established counterparty credit 

  

guidelines and only enter into derivative transactions with financial institutions with ‘a minusa3’ investment grade credit ratings or better vf continually monitors the credit rating of and limits the amount hedged with each counterparty additionally management utilizes a portfolio of financial institutions to minimize exposure to potential counterparty defaults and will adjust positions if necessary vf also monitors counterparty risk for derivative contracts within the defined benefit pension plans 

commodity price risks — vf is exposed to market risks for the pricing of cotton leather rubber wool and other materials which we either purchase directly or in a converted form such as fabric or shoe soles to manage risks of commodity price changes management negotiates prices in advance when possible vf has not historically managed commodity price exposures by using derivative instruments 

deferred compensation and related investment security risks — vf has nonqualified deferred compensation plans in which liabilities to the plans’ participants are based on the market values of investment funds selected by the participants the risk of changes in the market values of the participants’ investment selections is hedged by vf’s investment in a portfolio of securities that substantially mirror the participants’ investment selections increases and decreases in deferred compensation liabilities are substantially offset by corresponding increases and decreases in the market value of vf’s investments resulting in an insignificant net exposure to operating results and financial position 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

vf has chosen accounting policies that management believes are appropriate to accurately and fairly report vf’s operating results and financial position in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states vf applies these accounting policies in a consistent manner significant accounting policies are summarized in note a to the consolidated financial statements 

the application of these accounting policies requires that vf make estimates and assumptions about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses contingent assets and liabilities and related disclosures these estimates assumptions and judgments are based on historical experience current trends and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis because vf’s business cycle is relatively short ie from the date that an order is placed to manufacture or purchase inventory until that inventory is sold and the trade receivable is collected actual results related to most estimates are known within a few months after any balance sheet date in addition vf may retain outside specialists to assist in valuations of business acquisitions impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets equity compensation pension benefits and selfinsured liabilities if actual results ultimately differ from previous estimates the revisions are included in results of operations in the period in which the actual amounts become known 

vf believes the following accounting policies involve the most significant management estimates assumptions and judgments used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements or are the most sensitive to change from outside factors management has discussed the application of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 

inventories 

vf’s inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value cost includes all material labor and overhead costs incurred to manufacture or purchase the finished goods overhead allocated to manufactured product is based on the normal capacity of plants and does not include amounts related to idle capacity or abnormal production inefficiencies market value is based on a detailed review at each business unit at least quarterly of all inventories on the basis of individual styles or individual stylesizecolor stockkeeping units “skus” to identify slow moving or excess products discontinued and tobediscontinued products and offquality merchandise this review matches inventory on hand plus current production and purchase 

  

commitments with current and expected future sales orders for those units in inventory that are identified as slowmoving excess or offquality vf estimates their market value based on historical experience and current realization trends this evaluation performed using a systematic and consistent methodology requires forecasts of future demand market conditions and selling prices if the forecasted market value on an individual style or sku basis is less than cost vf provides an allowance to reflect the lower value of that inventory this methodology recognizes inventory exposures on an individual style or sku basis at the time such losses are evident rather than at the time goods are actually sold historically these estimates of future demand and selling prices have not varied significantly from actual results due to vf’s timely identification and rapid disposal of these reduced value inventories 

physical inventory counts are taken on a regular basis vf provides for estimated inventory losses that have likely occurred since the last physical inventory date historically physical inventory shrinkage has not been significant 

longlived assets 

vf allocates the purchase price of an acquired business to the fair values of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed with any excess purchase price recorded as goodwill vf evaluates fair value using three valuation techniques — the replacement cost market and income methods — and weights the valuation methods based on what is most appropriate in the circumstances the process of assigning fair values particularly to acquired intangible assets is highly subjective 

vf’s depreciation policies for property plant and equipment reflect judgments on their estimated economic lives and residual value if any vf’s amortization policies for intangible assets reflect judgments on the estimated amounts and duration of future cash flows expected to be generated by those assets in evaluating expected benefits to be received for customerrelated intangible assets management considers historical attrition patterns for various groups of customers for licenserelated intangible assets management considers historical trends and anticipated license renewal periods based on experience in renewing or extending similar arrangements regardless of whether there are explicit renewal provisions 

vf reviews property and definitelived intangible assets for possible impairment on an ongoing basis to determine if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable vf tests for possible impairment at the asset or asset group level which is the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent vf measures recoverability of the carrying value of an asset or asset group by comparison with estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if the forecasted total of undiscounted cash flows exceeds the carrying value of the asset there is no impairment charge if the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset vf estimates the fair value of the asset based on the present value of its future cash flows and recognizes an impairment charge for the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value 

indefinitelived intangible assets consisting of major trademarks and trade names and goodwill are not subject to amortization rather vf evaluates those assets for possible impairment as of the beginning of the fourth quarter as part of the annual strategic planning process or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of an asset may exceed its fair value 

fair value of an indefinitelived trademark intangible asset is based on an income approach using the relieffromroyalty method under this method forecasted global revenues for products sold with the trademark are assigned a royalty rate that would be charged to license the trademark in lieu of ownership from an independent party and fair value is the present value of those forecasted royalties avoided by owning the trademark if the fair value of the trademark intangible asset exceeds its carrying value there is no impairment charge if the fair value of the trademark is less than its carrying value an impairment charge would be recognized for the difference 

  

vf assesses the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill at each reporting unit using the required twostep approach reporting units are either coalitions or a business unit if discrete financial information is available and reviewed by coalition management two or more business units may be aggregated for impairment testing if they have similar economic characteristics in the first step of the goodwill impairment test vf compares the carrying value of a business unit including its recorded goodwill to the fair value of the business unit vf estimates the fair value of a business unit using both incomebased and marketbased valuation methods the principal method used is an incomebased method in which the business unit’s forecasted future cash flows are discounted to their present value in the marketbased valuation method the fair value of a business unit is estimated using multiples of revenues and of earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” for i a group of comparable public companies and ii recent transactions if any involving comparable companies based on the range of fair values developed from the income and marketbased methods vf determines the estimated fair value for the business unit if the fair value of the business unit exceeds its carrying value the goodwill is not impaired and no further review is required however if the fair value of the business unit is less than its carrying value vf performs the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the impairment charge if any the second step involves a hypothetical allocation of the fair value of the business unit to its net tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill as if the business unit were newly acquired which results in an implied fair value of the goodwill the amount of the impairment charge is the excess of the recorded goodwill over the implied fair value of the goodwill 

the incomebased fair value methodology requires management’s assumptions and judgments regarding economic conditions in the markets in which vf operates and conditions in the capital markets many of which are outside of management’s control at the business unit level fair value estimation requires management’s assumptions and judgments regarding the effects of overall economic conditions on the specific business unit along with assessment of the business unit’s strategies and forecasts of future cash flows forecasts of individual business unit cash flows involve management’s estimates and assumptions regarding 

 

  

  

 under the marketbased fair value methodology judgment is required in evaluating market multiples and recent transactions management believes that the assumptions used for its impairment tests are representative of those that would be used by market participants performing similar valuations of vf’s business units 

at the date of the most recent impairment test except for the 7 for all mankind ® trademark intangible assets discussed below and the recently acquired timberland ® trademark intangible assets the estimated fair values of all other indefinitelived intangible assets exceeded their respective carrying values by at least 30 in addition as a result of the goodwill impairment testing in 2011 the fair values of all business units except for the recently acquired timberland business exceeded their respective carrying values by at least 20 

in vf’s 2011 evaluation of goodwill and indefinitelived trademark intangible assets management concluded that the estimated fair value of the trademark intangible assets of the 7 for all mankind ® business unit exceeded the carrying value by approximately 4 a portion of the original value of these intangible assets was impaired as part of the 2010 evaluation which were written down from a book value of 312 million to fair value 

  

of 305 million at that time the financial results for this business in 2011 approximated the planned results and the expected future growth of the business beyond 2011 has not changed significantly from the prior year analysis accordingly these results are consistent with management’s expectation that the fair value of the 7 for all mankind ® trademark intangible assets would slightly exceed the carrying value all goodwill related to the 7 for all mankind ® business unit was written off as part of the 2010 impairment analysis 

it is possible that vf’s conclusions regarding impairment or recoverability of goodwill or intangible assets in any business unit could change in future periods if for example i the businesses do not perform as projected ii overall economic conditions in 2012 or future years vary from current assumptions including changes in discount rates iii business conditions or strategies for a specific business unit change from current assumptions iv investors require higher rates of return on equity investments in the marketplace or v enterprise values of comparable publicly traded companies or actual sales transactions of comparable companies were to decline resulting in lower multiples of revenues and ebitda a future impairment charge for goodwill or intangible assets could have a material effect on vf’s consolidated financial position or results of operations 

stock options 

vf uses a lattice optionpricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees and nonemployee members of the board of directors vf believes that a lattice model provides a refined estimate of the fair value of options because it can incorporate i historical option exercise patterns and multiple assumptions about future option exercise patterns for each of several groups of option holders and ii inputs that vary over time such as assumptions for interest rates and volatility management performs an annual review of all assumptions and believes that the assumptions employed in the valuation of each option grant are reflective of the outstanding options and underlying common stock and of groups of option participants the lattice valuation is based on the assumptions listed in note o to the consolidated financial statements 

one of the critical assumptions in the valuation process is estimating the expected average life of the options before they are exercised for each option grant vf estimated the expected average life based on evaluations of the historical and expected option exercise patterns for each of the groups of option holders that have historically exhibited different option exercise patterns these evaluations included i voluntary stock option exercise patterns based on a combination of changes in the price of vf common stock and periods of time that options are outstanding before exercise and ii involuntary exercise patterns resulting from turnover retirement and mortality 

volatility is another critical assumption requiring judgment management based its estimates of future volatility on a combination of implied and historical volatility implied volatility was based on shortterm 6 to 9 months publicly traded nearthemoney options on vf common stock vf measures historical volatility over a ten year period corresponding to the contractual term of the options using daily stock prices management’s assumption for valuation purposes was that expected volatility starts at a level equal to the implied volatility and then transitions to the historical volatility over the remainder of the ten year option term 

pension obligations 

vf sponsors a qualified defined benefit pension plan covering most fulltime domestic employees hired before 2005 and an unfunded supplemental defined benefit plan that provides benefits in excess of the limitations imposed by income tax regulations vf also sponsors defined benefit plans covering selected international employees the selection of actuarial assumptions for determining the projected pension benefit liabilities and annual pension expense is significant due to amounts involved and the long time period over which benefits are accrued and paid vf annually updates participant demographics and the expected amount and timing of benefit payments management reviews annually the principal economic actuarial assumptions summarized in note m to the consolidated financial statements and modifies them based on current rates and trends vf also 

  

periodically reviews and modifies as necessary other plan assumptions such as rates of compensation increases retirement termination disability and mortality vf believes the assumptions appropriately reflect the participants’ demographics and projected benefit obligations of the plans and result in the best estimate of the plans’ future experience actual results may vary from the actuarial assumptions used 

one of the critical assumptions used in the actuarial model is the discount rate this discussion of discount rate and the discussion of return on assets in the next paragraph relate specifically to the us pension plans which comprise over 90 of plan assets and projected benefit obligations of the combined domestic and international plans the discount rate is used to estimate the present value of future cash outflows necessary to meet projected benefit obligations it is the estimated interest rate that vf could use to settle its projected benefit obligations at the valuation date the discount rate assumption is based on current market interest rates vf selects the discount rate by matching high quality corporate bond yields to the timing of projected benefit payments to participants in the us pension plans vf uses the population of us corporate bonds rated ‘aa’ by moody’s investors service or if a moody’s rating is not available bonds rated ‘aa’ by two other recognized rating services from this population of over 500 such bonds having at least 50 million outstanding that are noncallablenonputable unless with makewhole provisions vf excluded the highest and lowest yielding bonds the plans’ projected benefit payments are matched to current market interest rates over the expected payment period and a present value is developed that produces a single discount rate that recognizes the plans’ distinct liability characteristics vf believes that those ‘aa’ rated issues meet the “high quality” intent of the applicable accounting standards and that the 2011 discount rate of 510 appropriately reflects current market conditions and the longterm nature of projected benefit payments to participants in the domestic pension plans this lower discount rate compared with the rate of 565 at the end of 2010 reflects the general decline in yields of us government obligations and high quality corporate bonds during 2011 the discount rate for the plans may differ from the rates used by other companies because of longer expected duration of benefit payments reflecting i the higher percentage of female participants who generally have a longer life expectancy than males and ii the higher percentage of inactive participants who will not begin receiving vested benefits for many years 

another critical assumption of the actuarial model is the expected longterm rate of return on investments vf’s investment objective is to maximize the longterm return through a diversified portfolio of assets with an acceptable level of risk these risks include market interest rate credit liquidity and foreign securities risks investment assets consist of domestic and international equity corporate and governmental fixed income real estate and commodity securities vf develops a projected rate of return for each of the investment asset classes based on many factors including recent and historical returns the estimated inflation rate the premium to be earned in excess of a riskfree return the premium for equity risk and the premium for longer duration fixed income securities the weighted average projected longterm rates of return of the various assets held by the qualified plan provide the basis for the expected longterm rate of return actuarial assumption vf’s rate of return assumption was 775 in both 2011 and 2010 and 800 in 2009 in recent years vf has altered the investment mix to improve investment performance by i increasing the allocation to fixed income investments and reducing the allocation to equity investments ii increasing the allocation in equities to more international investments and iii adding commodities as an asset class the changes in asset allocation should over time reduce the yeartoyear variability of the domestic plan’s funded status and resulting pension expense based on an evaluation of market conditions and projected market returns vf will be using a rate of return assumption of 750 for the us plan for 2012 management monitors the plan’s asset allocation to balance anticipated investment returns with risk 

differences between actual results and the respective actuarially determined assumed results eg investment performance discount rates and other assumptions in a given year do not affect that year’s pension expense but instead are deferred as unrecognized actuarial gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheet at the end of 2011 there were 5679 million of accumulated pretax deferred actuarial losses plus 152 million of deferred prior service costs resulting in an after tax amount of 3567 million in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the 2011 consolidated balance sheet these deferred losses will be amortized as a component of future years’ pension expense 

  

pension expense recognized in the financial statements was 566 million in 2011 676 million in 2010 and 980 million in 2009 this compares with the cost of pension benefits actually earned by covered active employees commonly called “service cost” of 209 million in 2011 181 million in 2010 and 149 million in 2009 pension expense for the last three years was significantly higher than the annual service cost because those years included the cost of amortizing prior years’ unrecognized actuarial losses as discussed in the preceding paragraph looking forward vf expects 2012 pension expense to increase to approximately 93 million primarily due to an increase in amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses 

the sensitivity of changes in actuarial assumptions on 2011 pension expense and on projected benefit obligations at the end of 2011 all other factors being equal is illustrated by the following 

 

 as discussed in the “risk management” section above vf has taken several steps to reduce the risk and volatility in the pension plans and their impact on the financial statements on a longerterm basis vf believes the yeartoyear variability of the retirement benefit expense should decrease 

income taxes 

as a global company vf is subject to income taxes and files income tax returns in over 100 domestic and foreign jurisdictions each year the calculation of income tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations which are subject to legal interpretation and significant management judgment 

vf’s income tax returns are regularly examined by federal state and foreign tax authorities and those audits may result in proposed adjustments vf has reviewed all issues raised upon examination as well as any exposure for issues that may be raised in future examinations vf has evaluated these potential issues under the “morelikelythannot” standard of the accounting literature a tax position is recognized if it meets this standard and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized such judgments and estimates may change based on audit settlements court cases and interpretation of tax laws and regulations income tax expense could be materially affected to the extent vf prevails in a tax position or when the statute of limitations expires for a tax position for which a liability for unrecognized tax benefits or valuation allowances has been established or to the extent vf is required to pay amounts greater than the established liability for unrecognized tax benefits vf does not currently anticipate any material impact on earnings from the ultimate resolution of income tax uncertainties there are no accruals for general or unknown tax expenses 

vf has 1749 million of deferred income tax assets related to operating loss and capital loss carryforwards and 1456 million of valuation allowances against those assets realization of deferred tax assets related to operating loss and capital loss carryforwards is dependent on future taxable income in specific jurisdictions the amount and timing of which are uncertain and on possible changes in tax laws if management believes that vf will not be able to generate sufficient taxable income or capital gains to offset losses during the carryforward periods vf records valuation allowances to reduce those deferred tax assets to amounts expected to be ultimately realized in addition vf has 60 million of valuation allowances against deferred income tax assets unrelated to operating loss and capital loss carryforwards if in a future period management determines that the amount of deferred tax assets to be realized differs from the net recorded amount vf would record an adjustment to income tax expense in that future period 

  

vf has not provided us income taxes on a portion of the foreign subsidiaries’ undistributed earnings because these earnings are permanently reinvested in the respective foreign jurisdictions if vf decided to remit those earnings to the united states in a future period the provision for income taxes could increase in that period 

nongaap financial information 

operating income and earnings per share are discussed in this annual report on form 10k both on a gaap basis and on an adjusted basis which excludes the impact of transaction and restructuring expenses related to the timberland acquisition in 2011 and impairment charges for goodwill and intangible assets in 2010 these measures are nongaap measures management believes these measures provide investors with useful supplemental information regarding vf’s underlying business trends and performance of vf’s ongoing operations and are useful for periodoverperiod comparisons of such operations 

management uses the above financial measures internally in its budgeting and review process and in some cases as a factor in determining compensation while management believes that these nongaap financial measures are useful in evaluating the business this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and should be viewed in addition to and not in lieu of or superior to vf’s operating performance measures calculated in accordance with gaap in addition these nongaap financial measures may not be the same as similarly titled measures presented by other companies 

the following table presents the financial results of vf as reported under gaap along with reconciliations to adjusted measures in 2011 and 2010 

 

 earnings per share amounts above may not add due to rounding 

the operating results of timberland have been included in vf’s financial statements since the acquisition date of september 13 2011 the timberland acquisition expenses were incurred by timberland and vf during periods before and after the acquisition date

jeanswear in most international markets is more fashionoriented and has a higher selling price than similar products in the united states the international jeans market is also more fragmented than the united states market with competitors ranging from global brands to a number of smaller brands marketed in a specific country or region 

 

vf’s largest international jeanswear business is located in western europe lee ® and wrangler ® jeanswear products are sold through department stores and specialty stores where we employ some of the same retail floor space management programs described above we also market lee ® and wrangler ® products to mass market and specialty stores in canada and mexico as well as to department stores and specialty stores in asia and south america in many international markets we are expanding our reach through vfoperated stores which are an important vehicle for presenting our brands’ image and marketing message directly to consumers we are continuing to expand our jeanswear brands in emerging markets and have experienced significant growth in china and india in foreign markets where vf does not have owned operations lee ® and wrangler ® products are marketed through distributors agents or licensees lee ® and wrangler ® products are sold in over 600 independently operated mono or multibrand stores primarily in eastern europe and asia 

 

in the united states we believe our jeanswear coalition is growing its jeans market share in the mass market westernwear specialty and national chain channels of distribution through superior consumer insight and marketing strategies and continuous product innovation internationally growth will be driven by expansion of our existing businesses in asia where we have averaged in excess of 21 revenue growth per year over the last three years with india showing a revenue growth of 64 in 2010 

 

imagewear coalition 

 

our imagewear coalition consists of the image occupational apparel and uniforms and licensed sports owned and licensed high profile sports and lifestyle apparel businesses each business represents approximately onehalf of coalition revenues 

 

the image business provides uniforms and career occupational apparel for workers in north america and internationally under the red kap ® brand a premium workwear brand with more than 75 years of history the bulwark ® brand flame resistant and protective apparel primarily for the petrochemical utility and mining industries the horace small ® brand apparel for law enforcement and public safety personnel and the chef 

designs tm brand apparel for restaurant and food service staff products include work pants slacks work shirts overalls jackets and smocks image revenues are significantly affected by the overall level of us industrial and service employment which improved slightly in 2010 following two years of economic contraction approximately twothirds of our image revenues are from industrial laundries resellers and distributors that in turn supply customized workwear to employers for onthejob wear by production service and whitecollar personnel since industrial laundries and uniform distributors maintain minimal inventories of work clothes vf’s ability to offer rapid delivery of products in a broad range of sizes is an important advantage in this market our commitment to customer service supported by an automated central distribution center with several satellite locations enables customer orders to be filled within 24 to 48 hours of receipt and has helped the red kap ® and bulwark ® brands obtain a significant share of uniform apparel sold to laundries resellers and other distributors 

 

our image business also develops and manages uniform programs through customdesigned websites for major business customers eg fedex corporation att air canada continental airlines american airlines and governmental organizations eg us customs and border protection fire department of new york city transportation security administration national park service new york city transit authority these websites give these customers’ employees the convenience of shopping for their work and career apparel via the internet we believe this business is the nation’s largest supplier of nonmilitary apparel to the us government 

 

in the licensed sports business we design and market sports apparel and fanwear under licenses granted by the major sports leagues individual athletes and related organizations including major league baseball the national football league the national basketball association the national hockey league mlb players association and selected major colleges and universities under license from major league baseball majestic ® brand uniforms are worn exclusively onfield by all 30 major league teams majestic ® brand adult and youthsize authentic replica jersey and fanwear are sold through sporting goods and athletic specialty stores department stores and major league stadiums adult and youth sports apparel products marketed under other licensed labels are distributed through department mass market sporting goods and athletic specialty stores our quick response capabilities allow us to deliver products to retailers within hours following major sporting events such as the super bowl the world series and conference or division playoff championships during the year we extended our license agreement with the national football league for an additional five year period to 2017 and also added apparel rights for the canadian european and asian markets beginning in 2012 in addition the licensed sports division is a major supplier of licensed harleydavidson ® apparel marketed to harleydavidson dealerships 

 

the opportunities to grow our imagewear coalition revenues include i extension of its product and service capabilities to new industrial and service apparel distribution channels markets and geographies ii growth of our major league baseball and national football league programs iii market share gains in key licensed categories such as women’s sports apparel iv expansion of our college and university fanware program and v extension of vf’s floor space management and quick response retail replenishment capabilities to more retail doors placing the right product assortments on the sales floor in each geographic market 

 

sportswear coalition 

 

the nautica ® brand is the primary lifestyle brand in the sportswear coalition nautica ® men’s sportswear noted for its classic styling is marketed through department stores specialty stores and vfoperated outlet stores in premium and better outlet centers the nautica jeans company ® line features jeanswear and related tops for younger male consumers we believe the nautica ® brand is the number two men’s sportswear collection brand in department stores other nautica ® product lines include men’s outerwear underwear and swimwear and men’s and women’s sleepwear nautica ® women’s sportswear is marketed in the united states at most nautica ® outlet stores and at wwwnauticacom 

 

the sportswear coalition operates over 90 nautica ® outlet stores in premium and better outlet centers across the united states these stores carry nautica ® merchandise for men women boys girls and infants the products sold in the outlet stores are different from the nautica ® styles sold to department and specialty store wholesale customers although the design inspiration and color palette are consistent across both lines these outlet stores also carry nautica ® merchandise from licensees to complete their product assortment the product assortment offered at wwwnauticacom includes products from both the wholesale and retail lines as well as licensed merchandise in 

addition independent licensees operate over 200 nautica ® brand stores across the world about 80 of these are full price stores and 20 are outlet stores with the majority of these stores in southeast europe central america and china 

 

the nautica ® brand is licensed to independent parties in the united states for apparel categories not produced by vf eg tailored clothing dress shirts neckwear women’s swimwear and outerwear children’s clothing and for nonapparel categories eg accessories fragrances watches eyewear bed and bath products furniture nautica ® products are licensed for sale in over 50 countries outside the united states our licensees’ annual wholesale sales of nautica ® licensed products are approximately 400 million 

 

the sportswear coalition also includes the kipling ® business in north america whose products include kipling ® brand handbags luggage backpacks totes and accessories kipling ® has seen significant growth in 2010 from increased distribution two new vfoperated stores increased sales of its products at most existing customers and a new kipling ® handbags and accessories program during 2010 that is exclusive with macy’s inc department stores kipling ® products are also sold in the united states through specialty luggage and bag stores vfoperated stores and wwwkiplingcom and in canada through specialty and department stores about twothirds of brand revenue is generated from products that are the same as those sold in europe and other parts of the world with the remainder designed and sold only in the united states 

 

we believe there is potential to improve nautica ® brand revenue and profit performance through the growth of core nautica sportswear products increased pricing improved product assortments and an enhanced customer experience at our nautica ® outlet stores growth in our online business and expansion of the licensed business internationally there is also potential for expansion of our kipling ® brand through our handbag and accessories relationship with macy’s inc as well as the opportunity to open additional vfoperated stores 

 

contemporary brands coalition 

 

our contemporary brands coalition is focused on premium upscale lifestyle brands the coalition is comprised of the 7 for all mankind ®  john varvatos ®  splendid ® and ella moss ® brands 

 

7 for all mankind ® is a los angelesbased brand of premium denim jeans and related products for women and men while the core business remains focused on denim the collection also includes sportswear products such as knit and woven tops sweaters jackets and accessories products are noted for their fit and for innovation in design fabric and finish 7 for all mankind ® is a leading premium jeans brand in the united states with the premium segment defined as jeans retailing for 100 or more retail price points for the brand’s core jeans range from 150 — 199 for basics with higher price points for more fashionforward products with twothirds of its sales in the united states the brand is marketed through premium department stores such as bloomingdale’s nordstrom neiman marcus saks macy’s and through specialty stores in addition we opened 12 stores in the united states during 2010 bringing the total to 39 stores international sales are through department stores such as harrods in london specialty stores as well as vfoperated stores we are pursuing growth of this brand through new stores ecommerce additional sportswear product offerings licensing and increasing productivity in the wholesale channel we are also focusing on international growth opportunities primarily through companyoperated and partnership stores and further geographic expansion in europe and asia 

 

the john varvatos ® brand is a luxury apparel and accessories collection for men including tailored clothing sportswear footwear and accessories the john varvatos  usa ® line of tailored clothing sportswear footwear and accessories is designed to appeal to a younger consumer at more accessible price points products are sold primarily in the united states through upscale department and specialty stores vfoperated john varvatos ® retail locations and online at wwwjohnvarvatoscom this business is 80 owned by vf with the balance owned by mr varvatos 

 

in march 2009 vf acquired the splendid ® brand of women’s men’s and children’s premium tops and casual apparel and ella moss ® brand of women’s premium sportswear the brands noted for their soft wearable fabrics and vibrant colors are marketed to upscale department and specialty stores primarily in the united states we have four splendid ® stores along with shopinshops in some of our major retail accounts 

 

the recession significantly impacted sales of premium apparel products during 2008 and 2009 as many consumers reduced spending for luxury goods this led to the closing of a significant number of specialty stores as 

well as a reduction in same store sales comparisons in the upscale department store channel although operating results of the upscale department stores have improved during 2010 the premium denim market remains particularly challenging further the specialty store channel has not rebounded to prerecession levels however we still see opportunities for growth through store openings ecommerce and wholesale geographic and product expansion 

 

directtoconsumer operations 

 

vfoperated stores are part of our longterm strategy to drive revenue growth and profitability our full price stores allow us to showcase a brand’s full line of current season products with fixtures and imagery that support the brand’s positioning these stores provide high visibility for our brands and products and enable us to stay close to the needs and preferences of our consumers the proper presentation of products in our stores particularly in our showcase stores also helps to increase consumer purchases of vf products sold through our wholesale customers vfoperated full price stores generally provide operating margins that are equal to or above vf averages and a return on investment well above vf averages in addition vf operates outlet stores in both premium outlet malls and more traditional valuebased locations these outlet stores serve an important role in our overall inventory management and profitability by allowing vf to sell a significant portion of excess discontinued and outofseason products at better prices than are otherwise available from outside parties while maintaining the integrity of our brands 

 

our growing global retail operations include 786 stores at the end of 2010 of that total there are 711 monobrand stores ie primarily one brand’s products offered in each store that sell the north face ®  vans ®  nautica ®  7 for all mankind ®  lucy ®  splendid ®  lee ®  wrangler ®  napapijri ®  john varvatos ®  kipling ®  and eastpak ®  approximately 78 of these stores offer products at full price with the remainder being outlet locations offering excess discontinued and outofseason products at discounted prices we also operate 75 vf outlet stores in the united states that sell a broad selection of excess quantities of vfbranded products as well as women’s intimate apparel childrenswear other apparel and accessories approximately 75 of the vfoperated stores are located in the united states with the remaining stores located in europe latin america and asia 

 

across the globe internet sales ie ecommerce comprise a small but rapidly growing portion of apparel footwear and accessories sales at vf we currently market the north face ®  vans ®  lee ®  wrangler ®  7 for all mankind ®  lucy ®  nautica ®  kipling ®  splendid ®  ella moss ® and john varvatos ® online in the united states plus the north face ® and other brands across europe we will continue to expand our ecommerce initiatives through continued rollout of brand sites in europe and asia and enhancing each brand’s site to deliver a superior experience with each transaction ecommerce is our fastest growing directtoconsumer channel and represents approximately 8 of our directtoconsumer business 

 

total retail store and ecommerce revenues accounted for 18 of vf’s consolidated total revenues in 2010 and 17 in 2009 we expect our directtoconsumer business to continue to grow at a faster pace than vf’s overall growth rate as we continue opening stores and expanding our ecommerce presence during 2010 we opened 85 stores and are planning to open approximately 100 new retail locations in 2011 for 2011 retail capital investments of approximately 85 million will be concentrated where we see higher growth potential — vans ®  the north face ®  7 for all mankind ® and international 

 

in addition our licensees distributors and other independent parties operate over 1700 partnership stores which are primarily monobrand stores that have the appearance of vfoperated stores these stores — most of which are in eastern europe and asia — are focused on the north face ®  kipling ®  nautica ®  lee ® and wrangler ® brands 

 

licensing arrangements 

 

as part of our business strategy of expanding market penetration of vfowned brands we may enter into licensing agreements for specific apparel and complementary product categories if such arrangements with independent parties can provide more effective manufacturing distribution and marketing of such products than could be achieved internally we provide support to these business partners and ensure the integrity of our brand 

names by taking an active role in the design quality control advertising marketing and distribution of licensed products 

 

licensing arrangements relate to a broad range of vf brands license agreements are for fixed terms of generally three to five years with conditional renewal options each licensee pays royalties to vf based on its sales of licensed products with most agreements providing for a minimum royalty requirement royalties generally range from 5 to 7 of the licensing partners’ net licensed products sales gross royalty income was 780 million in 2010 with the largest contributions from the nautica ®  vans ®  the north face ®  john varvatos ®  lee ® and wrangler ® brands in addition licensees of our brands are generally required to spend from 1 to 5 of their net licensed product sales to advertise vf’s products in some cases these advertising amounts are remitted to vf for advertising on behalf of the licensees 

 

vf has also entered into license agreements to use trademarks owned by third parties we market apparel under licenses granted by major league baseball the national football league the national basketball association the national hockey league harleydavidson motor company inc major colleges and universities and individual athletes and related organizations most of which contain minimum annual licensing and advertising requirements 

 

manufacturing sourcing and distribution 

 

product design fit fabric finish and quality are important in all of our businesses these functions are performed by employees located in either our global supply chain organization or our branded business units across the globe 

 

vf’s centralized global supply chain organization sources product and is responsible for delivering products to our customers vf is highly skilled in managing the complexities associated with the supply chain vf’s revenues are comprised of over 400 million units spread across 30 brands vf operates 25 manufacturing facilities and utilizes at least 1500 contractor manufacturing facilities in over 60 countries we operate approximately 30 distribution centers and 786 retail stores managing this complexity is made possible by our use of information systems technologies — with sophisticated systems for product development forecasting order management and warehouse management attached to our core enterprise resource management platform 

 

in 2010 34 of our units were manufactured in vfowned facilities and 66 were obtained from independent contractors primarily in asia products manufactured in vf facilities generally have a lower cost and shorter lead times than contracted production products obtained from contractors in the western hemisphere generally have a higher cost than products obtained from contractors in the far east but contracting in the western hemisphere gives us greater flexibility shorter lead times and allows for lower inventory levels this combination of vfowned and contracted production along with different geographic regions and cost structures provides a wellbalanced approach to product sourcing we will continue to manage our supply chain from a global perspective and adjust as needed to changes in the global production environment 

 

we operate manufacturing facilities primarily cutting sewing and finishing located in mexico central america and the middle east a significant percentage of our denim bottoms and occupational apparel are manufactured in these plants for these owned production facilities we purchase raw materials from numerous domestic and international suppliers to meet our production needs raw materials include fabrics made from cotton synthetics and blends of cotton and synthetic yarn as well as thread and trim product identification buttons zippers and snaps in some instances we contract the sewing of vfowned raw materials into finished product with independent contractors in the united states mexico and central america owned manufacturing in the united states is primarily limited to screen printing and embroidery of jerseys tshirts and fleece products including major league baseball uniforms and other products while we obtain fixed price commitments for fabric and certain supplies for up to one year in advance specific purchase obligations with suppliers are typically limited to the succeeding two to six months our only longterm contract is a commitment in connection with the sale of our childrenswear business in 2004 to purchase childrenswear for sale through our vf outlet stores with a minimum of 150 million per year through 2015 no single supplier represents more than 5 of our total cost of sales 

 

our independent contractors generally own the raw materials and ship finished readyforsale products to vf these contractors are engaged through vf sourcing hubs in hong kong with satellite offices across asia and 

panama these hubs are responsible for product procurement product quality assurance supplier management transportation and shipping functions in the eastern and western hemispheres respectively substantially all products in the outdoor  action sports and sportswear coalitions as well as a portion of product requirements for our jeanswear and imagewear coalitions are obtained through these sourcing hubs for most products in our contemporary brands coalition we contract the sewing and finishing of vfowned raw materials through a network of independent domestic contractors 

 

management continually monitors political risks and developments related to duties tariffs and quotas we limit vf’s sourcing exposure through among other measures i extensive geographic diversification with a mix of vfoperated and contracted production ii shifts of production among countries and contractors iii allocation of production to merchandise categories where the free flow of product is available and iv sourcing from countries with tariff preference and free trade agreements vf does not directly or indirectly source products from suppliers in countries identified by the state department as state sponsors of terrorism and subject to us economic sanctions and export controls 

 

all vfowned production facilities throughout the world as well as all independent contractor facilities that manufacture vfbranded products must comply with vf’s global compliance principles these principles established in 1997 and consistent with international labor standards are a set of strict standards covering legal and ethical business practices workers’ ages work hours health and safety conditions environmental standards and compliance with local laws and regulations in addition our owned factories must also undergo certification by the independent nonprofit organization worldwide responsible accredited production “wrap” which promotes global ethics in manufacturing vf through its contractor monitoring program audits the activities of the independent businesses and contractors that produce vfbranded goods at locations across the globe each of the over 1500 independent contractor facilities including those serving our independent licensees must be precertified prior to performance of any production on behalf of vf this precertification includes passing a factory inspection and signing a vf terms of engagement agreement we maintain an ongoing audit program to ensure compliance with these requirements by using dedicated internal and outsourced staff additional information about vf’s code of business conduct global compliance principles terms of engagement factory compliance guidelines factory audit procedure and environmental compliance guidelines along with a global compliance report is available on the vf website at wwwvfccom 

 

vf did not experience difficulty in filling its raw material and contracting production needs during 2010 it is possible that we could experience some challenges in our supply chain during 2011 due to increases in demand and pricing for raw materials primarily related to the cost of cotton although vf is not immune to these pressures we believe that we will be able to retain our competitive advantage due to our scale and significance to our suppliers the loss of any one supplier or contractor would not have a significant adverse effect on our business 

 

product is shipped from our independent suppliers and vfoperated manufacturing plants to distribution centers in the united states and international markets in limited instances product is shipped directly to our customers product is inspected sorted and stored in our distribution centers until needed for packing and shipping to our wholesale customers or our stores most distribution centers are operated by vf and some support more than one brand our distribution centers use computercontrolled inventory management technology for efficient tracking moving and shipping of products a small portion of our distribution needs are met by contract distribution centers 

 

seasonality 

 

vf’s operating results vary from quartertoquarter throughout the year due to the differing sales patterns of our individual businesses on a quarterly basis and excluding the effect of acquisitions consolidated total revenues for 2010 ranged from a low of 21 of full year revenues in the second quarter to a high of 29 in the third quarter while consolidated operating income ranged from a low of 17 in the second quarter to a high of 35 in the third quarter this variation results primarily from the seasonal influences on revenues of our outdoor  action sports coalition where 18 of the coalition’s revenues occurred in the second quarter and 33 in the third quarter of 2010 with changes in our mix of business and growth of our retail operations historical quarterly revenue and 

profit trends may not be indicative of future trends we expect the portion of annual revenues and profits occurring in the second half of the year to continue to increase 

 

working capital requirements vary throughout the year working capital generally increases during the first half of the year as inventory builds to support peak shipping periods and then decreases during the second half of the year as those inventories are sold and accounts receivable are collected cash provided by operating activities is substantially higher in the second half of the year due to higher net income during that period and reduced working capital requirements particularly during the fourth quarter 

 

advertising and customer support 

 

during 2010 our advertising and promotion spending was 4268 million representing 55 of net sales we advertise in consumer and trade publications on national and local radio and television and on the internet we also participate in cooperative advertising on a shared cost basis with major retailers in print media radio and television we sponsor sporting musical and special events and sponsor a number of athletes and personalities we employ marketing sciences to optimize the impact of advertising and promotional spending and to identify the types of spending that provide the greatest return on our marketing investments 

 

we provide pointofsale fixtures and signage to our wholesale customers to enhance the presentation and brand image of our products we utilize shopinshops which are separate sales areas dedicated to a specific vf brand within our customers’ stores to help differentiate and enhance the presentation of our products we participate in concession arrangements with department store customers in china and other international markets in a typical concession arrangement the department store provides a dedicated sales area along with checkout credit and other retail services while vf owns and bears the risk of inventory ownership concession sales associates may be employees of vf or the department store 

 

we participate in incentive programs with our retailer customers including discounts allowances and cooperative advertising funds we also offer sales incentive programs directly to consumers in the form of rebate and coupon offers 

 

we maintain internet sites for most of our brands many of them are ecommerce sites where consumers can order products from vf other websites provide information about our brands and products and may direct consumers to our wholesale customers where they can purchase our products we also operate several businesstobusiness sites where our retail customers can order vf products 

 

many of our coalitions employ a staff of instore marketing and merchandising coordinators located in major cities across the united states these individuals visit our customers’ retail locations to ensure that our products and those of our licensees are properly presented on the merchandise sales floor and to inform the customers’ sales associates about our products and related promotions 

 

in addition to sponsorships and activities that directly benefit our products and brands vf and its associates actively support our communities and various charities for example the north face ® has committed to programs that encourage and enable outdoor participation such as planet explore wwwplanetexplorecom the never stop exploring award and the explore your parks program nautica ® has partnered with oceana a notforprofit organization focused on ocean conservation and 2010 marked the fifteenth year of support for lee national denim day ®  one of the country’s largest singleday fundraisers for breast cancer which has raised over 80 million to fight breast cancer since inception vf also supports companywide sustainability efforts and recognizes the “vf 100” as a means of honoring the 100 vf associates worldwide having the highest number of volunteer service hours during the year

tablestart 


 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating vf’s business and the forwardlooking statements contained in this form 10k any of the following risks could materially adversely affect vf’s business its operating results and its financial condition 

 

vf’s revenues and profits depend on the level of consumer spending for apparel which is sensitive to general economic conditions a decline in consumer spending could have a material adverse effect on vf 

 

the apparel industry has historically been subject to cyclical variations and is particularly affected by adverse trends in the general economy the success of vf’s business depends on consumer spending and there are a number of factors that influence consumer spending including actual and perceived economic conditions disposable consumer income interest rates availability of credit housing costs stock market performance energy prices and tax rates in the 

international national regional and local markets where vf’s products are sold consumer spending advanced at a relatively slow pace during 2010 following the recessionary conditions of 2008 and early 2009 a decline in actual or perceived economic conditions or other factors could negatively impact the level of consumer spending 

 

the effects of a return to recessionary conditions could have a material adverse effect on vf 

 

the global recession — with rising unemployment reduced availability of credit increased savings rates and declines in real estate and securities values — had and is continuing to have a negative impact on retail sales of apparel and other consumer products reduced sales at our wholesale customers may lead to lower retail inventory levels reduced orders to vf or order cancellations these lower sales volumes along with the possibility of restrictions on access to the credit markets may result in our customers experiencing financial difficulties including store closures bankruptcies or liquidations this may result in higher credit risk relating to receivables from our customers who are experiencing these financial difficulties if these developments occur our inability to shift sales to other customers or to collect on vf’s trade accounts receivable could have a material adverse effect on vf’s financial condition and results of operations 

 

a growing portion of our revenues are directtoconsumer through vfoperated stores and ecommerce websites it is possible that reduced consumer confidence along with a reduction in availability of consumer credit and increasing unemployment could lead to a reduction in our directtoconsumer sales channel this could have a material adverse effect on vf’s financial condition and results of operations 

 

fluctuations in the price availability and quality of raw materials and finished goods could increase costs 

 

fluctuations in the price availability and quality of fabrics or other raw materials used by vf in its manufactured apparel or of purchased finished goods could have a material adverse effect on vf’s cost of sales or its ability to meet its customers’ demands the prices for fabrics depend on demand and market prices for the raw materials used to produce them with the price of cotton currently having a significant negative impact the price and availability of such raw materials may fluctuate significantly depending on many factors including crop yields weather patterns and speculation in the commodities markets prices of purchased finished products also depend on wage rates in asia and other geographic areas where our independent contractors are located as well as freight costs from those regions in the future vf may not be able to offset cost increases with other cost reductions or efficiencies or to pass higher costs on to its customers in addition increased costs could lead to reduced customer demand these developments could have a material adverse effect on vf’s results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

 

the apparel industry is highly competitive and vf’s success depends on its ability to respond to constantly changing fashion trends and consumer demand reduced sales or prices resulting from competition could have a material adverse effect on vf 

 

vf competes with numerous apparel brands and manufacturers some of our competitors are larger and have more resources than vf in some product categories and geographies in addition vf competes directly with the private label brands of most of its wholesale customers vf’s ability to compete within the apparel and footwear industries depends on our ability to

if we misjudge fashion trends and market conditions we could have insufficient levels of inventory that cause us to miss opportunities to make sales or we could have significant excess inventories of products that we may have to sell at a loss failure to compete effectively or to keep pace with rapidly changing markets and trends could have a material adverse effect on vf’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

vf’s results of operations could be materially harmed if we are unable to accurately forecast demand for our products 

 

we often schedule internal production and place orders for products with independent manufacturers before our customers’ orders are firm factors that could affect our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products include 

 

  

if we fail to accurately forecast consumer demand we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of product required to meet the demand inventory levels in excess of consumer demand may result in inventory writedowns and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices which could have an adverse effect on vf’s results of operations and financial condition on the other hand if we underestimate demand for our products our manufacturing facilities or third party manufacturers may not be able to produce products to meet consumer requirements and this could result in delays in the shipment of products and lost revenues as well as damage to vf’s reputation and relationships there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully manage inventory levels to meet our future order requirements 

 

a substantial portion of vf’s revenues and gross profit is derived from a small number of large customers the loss of any of these customers could substantially reduce vf’s revenues and profits 

 

a few of vf’s customers account for a significant portion of revenues sales to vf’s ten largest customers were 26 of total revenues in fiscal 2010 with walmart stores inc accounting for 10 of revenues sales are generally on a purchase order basis and we do not have longterm agreements with any of our customers a decision by any of vf’s major customers to significantly decrease the volume of products purchased from vf could substantially reduce revenues and have a material adverse effect on vf’s financial condition and results of operations moreover in recent years the retail industry has experienced consolidation and other ownership changes in the future retailers may further consolidate undergo restructurings or reorganizations realign their affiliations or reposition their stores’ target markets these developments could result in a reduction in the number of stores that carry vf’s products increase ownership concentration within the retail industry increase credit exposure or increase leverage over their suppliers these changes could impact vf’s opportunities in the market and increase vf’s reliance on a smaller number of large customers 

 

vf’s profitability may decline as a result of increasing pressure on margins 

 

the apparel industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors including intense competition consolidation in the retail industry pressure from retailers to reduce the costs of products and changes in consumer demand if these factors cause us to reduce our sales prices to retailers and consumers and we fail to sufficiently reduce our product costs or operating expenses vf’s profitability will decline this could have a material adverse effect on vf’s results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

vf may not succeed in implementing its growth strategy 

 

one of our key strategic objectives is growth we seek to grow through both organic growth and acquisitions by building new growing lifestyle brands expanding our share with winning customers stretching vf’s brands to new geographies managing costs leveraging our supply chain and information technology capabilities across vf expanding our directtoconsumer business and identifying and developing high potential employees we may not be able to grow our existing businesses we may have difficulty completing acquisitions and we may not be able to successfully integrate a newly acquired business or achieve the expected growth cost savings or synergies from such integration we may not be able to expand our market share with winning customers expand our brands geographically or achieve the expected results from our supply chain initiatives we may also have difficulty recruiting or developing qualified employees failure to implement our growth strategy may have a material adverse effect on vf’s business 

 

vf’s operations in international markets and earnings in those markets may be affected by legal regulatory political and economic risks 

 

our ability to maintain the current level of operations in our existing international markets and to capitalize on growth in existing and new international markets is subject to risks associated with international operations these include the burdens of complying with foreign laws and regulations unexpected changes in regulatory requirements new tariffs or other barriers in some international markets 

 

we cannot predict whether quotas duties taxes exchange controls or other restrictions will be imposed by the united states the european union or other countries on the import or export of our products or what effect any of these actions would have on vf’s business financial condition or results of operations we cannot predict whether there might be changes in our ability to repatriate earnings or capital from international jurisdictions changes in regulatory geopolitical policies and other factors may adversely affect vf’s business or may require us to modify our current business practices 

 

approximately 40 of vf’s net income is earned in international jurisdictions vf is exposed to risks of changes in us policy for companies having business operations outside the united states the president and others in his administration have proposed changes in us income tax laws that could among other things accelerate the us taxability of nonus earnings or limit foreign tax credits although such proposals have been deferred if new legislation were enacted it is possible our us income tax expense could increase which would reduce our earnings 

 

vf uses foreign suppliers and manufacturing facilities for a substantial portion of its raw materials and finished products which poses risks to vf’s business operations 

 

during fiscal 2010 approximately 66 of vf’s units were purchased from independent manufacturers primarily located in asia with substantially all of the remainder produced by vfowned and operated manufacturing facilities located in mexico central america and the middle east although no single supplier and no one country is critical to vf’s production needs any of the following could impact our ability to produce or deliver vf products and as a result have a material adverse effect on vf’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

 17 

 

  

our business is subject to national state and local laws and regulations for environmental employment safety and other matters the costs of compliance with or the violation of such laws and regulations by vf or by independent suppliers who manufacture products for vf could have an adverse effect on our operations and cash flows 

 

numerous governmental agencies enforce comprehensive federal state and local laws and regulations on a wide range of environmental employment safety and other matters vf could be adversely affected by costs of compliance with or violations of those laws and regulations in addition the costs of products purchased by vf from independent contractors could increase due to the costs of compliance by those contractors further violations of such laws and regulations could affect the availability of inventory affecting our net sales 

 

if vf’s suppliers fail to use acceptable ethical business practices vf’s business could suffer 

 

we require third party suppliers to operate in compliance with applicable laws rules and regulations regarding working conditions employment practices and environmental compliance however we do not control the practices of our independent manufacturers if one of our independent contractors violates labor or other laws or implements labor or other business practices that are generally regarded as unethical in the united states it could impact vf’s reputation and relationships although the loss of a single supplier would not have a significant impact on our operations it could result in interruption of finished goods shipments to vf cancellation of orders by customers and termination of relationships this along with the damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on vf’s revenues and consequently its results of operations 

 

vf’s business is exposed to the risks of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations vf’s hedging strategies may not be effective in mitigating those risks 

 

approximately 30 of vf’s total revenues is derived from international markets vf’s foreign businesses operate in functional currencies other than the us dollar changes in currency exchange rates may affect the us dollar value of the foreign currencydenominated amounts at which vf’s international businesses purchase products incur costs or sell products in addition for vf’s usbased businesses the majority of products are sourced from independent contractors or vf plants located in foreign countries as a result the cost of these products may be affected by changes in the value of the relevant currencies furthermore much of vf’s licensing revenue is derived from sales in foreign currencies changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse impact on vf’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

in accordance with our operating practices we hedge a significant portion of our foreign currency transaction exposures arising in the ordinary course of business to reduce risks in our cash flows and earnings our hedging strategies may not be effective in reducing these risks and no hedging strategy can completely insulate vf from foreign exchange risk we do not hedge foreign currency translation rate changes 

 

further our use of derivative financial instruments may expose vf to counterparty risks although vf only enters into hedging contracts with counterparties having investment grade credit ratings it is possible that the credit quality of a counterparty could be downgraded or a counterparty could default on its obligations which could have a material adverse impact on vf’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

vf borrows funds on a shortterm basis primarily to support seasonal working capital requirements longterm debt is part of vf’s total capital structure because of conditions in global credit markets vf may have difficulty accessing capital markets for short or longterm financing 

 

particularly in 2008 and continuing to a lesser extent during the last two years global capital and credit markets have experienced extreme volatility and disruption with government intervention mergers or bankruptcies of several major financial institutions and a general decline in global liquidity many corporate issuers have been unable to access credit markets 

 

we typically use shortterm commercial paper borrowings to support seasonal working capital requirements with amounts generally repaid by the end of each year from strong cash flows from operations vf was able to continue to borrow in the commercial paper markets during the last three years and our commercial paper borrowings in 2010 were minimal in the future vf may seek to access the longterm capital markets to replace maturing debt obligations or to fund acquisition or other growth opportunities there is no assurance that the commercial paper markets or the longterm capital markets will continue to be reliable sources of financing for vf 

 

vf has domestic and international bank credit facilities one or more of the participating banks may not be able to honor their commitments which could have an adverse effect on vf’s business 

 

vf has 13 billion of domestic and international bank credit facilities that expire in october 2012 if the financial markets return to recessionary conditions this could impair the ability of one or more of the banks participating in our credit agreements from honoring their commitments this could have an adverse effect on our business if we were not able to replace those commitments or to locate other sources of liquidity on acceptable terms 

 

the loss of members of vf’s executive management and other key employees could have a material adverse effect on its business 

 

vf depends on the services and management experience of its executive officers and business leaders who have substantial experience and expertise in vf’s business vf also depends on other key employees involved in the operation of its business competition for experienced and wellqualified personnel in the apparel industry is intense the unexpected loss of services of one or more of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on vf 

 

vf may be unable to protect its trademarks and other intellectual property rights 

 

vf’s trademarks and other intellectual property rights are important to its success and its competitive position vf is susceptible to others imitating its products and infringing its intellectual property rights especially with the shift in product mix to higher priced brands and innovative new products in recent years some of vf’s brands such as the north face ®  vans ®  jansport ®  nautica ®  wrangler ® and lee ® brands enjoy significant worldwide consumer recognition and the higher pricing of those products creates additional risk of counterfeiting and infringement 

 

counterfeiting of vf’s products or infringement on its intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our brands and adversely affect vf’s revenues actions we have taken to establish and protect vf’s intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of its products by others or to prevent others from seeking to invalidate its trademarks or block sales of vf’s products as a violation of the trademarks and intellectual property rights of others in addition unilateral actions in the united states or other countries including changes to or the repeal of laws recognizing trademark or other intellectual property rights could have an impact on vf’s ability to enforce those rights 

 

the value of vf’s intellectual property could diminish if others assert rights in or ownership of trademarks and other intellectual property rights of vf or trademarks that are similar to vf’s trademarks or trademarks that vf licenses from others we may be unable to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction in some cases there may be trademark owners who have prior rights to vf’s trademarks because the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states in other 

cases there may be holders who have prior rights to similar trademarks vf is from time to time involved in opposition and cancellation proceedings with respect to some of its intellectual property rights 

 

vf is subject to the risk that its licensees may not generate expected sales or maintain the value of vf’s brands 

 

during 2010 780 million of vf’s revenues were derived from licensing royalties although vf generally has significant control over its licensees’ products and advertising we rely on our licensees for among other things operational and financial controls over their businesses failure of our licensees to successfully market licensed products or our inability to replace existing licensees if necessary could adversely affect vf’s revenues both directly from reduced royalties received and indirectly from reduced sales of our other products risks are also associated with a licensee’s ability to 

 

  

in addition vf relies on its licensees to help preserve the value of its brands although we make every attempt to protect vf’s brands through approval rights over design production processes quality packaging merchandising distribution advertising and promotion of our licensed products we cannot completely control the use of licensed vf brands by our licensees the misuse of a brand by a licensee could have a material adverse effect on that brand and on vf 

 

vf has entered into license agreements to use the trademarks of others loss of a license could have an adverse effect on vf’s operating results 

 

vf has entered into agreements to market products under licenses granted by third parties including major league baseball the national football league and harleydavidson motor company inc some of these licenses are for a short term and do not contain renewal options loss of a license which in certain cases could result in an impairment charge for related operating and intangible assets could have an adverse effect on vf’s operating results 

 

vf relies significantly on information technology any inadequacy interruption integration failure or security failure of that technology could harm vf’s ability to effectively operate its business 

 

our ability to effectively manage and operate our business depends significantly on information technology systems the failure of these systems to operate effectively problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems difficulty in integrating new systems or systems of acquired businesses or a breach in security of these systems could adversely impact the operations of vf’s business moreover vf and its customers could suffer harm if customer information were accessed by third parties due to a security failure in vf’s systems it could also require significant expenditures to remediate any such failure problem or breach 

 

if vf encounters problems with its distribution system vf’s ability to deliver its products to the market could be adversely affected 

 

vf relies on owned or independentlyoperated distribution facilities to warehouse and ship product to its customers vf’s distribution system includes computercontrolled and automated equipment which may be subject to a number of risks related to security or computer viruses the proper operation of software and hardware power interruptions or other system failures because substantially all of vf’s products are distributed from a relatively small number of locations vf’s operations could also be interrupted by earthquakes floods fires or other natural disasters near its distribution centers we maintain business interruption insurance but it may not adequately protect vf from the adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in vf’s distribution facilities such as the 

longterm loss of customers or an erosion of brand image in addition vf’s distribution capacity is dependent on the timely performance of services by third parties including the transportation of product to and from its distribution facilities if we encounter problems with our distribution system our ability to meet customer expectations manage inventory complete sales and achieve operating efficiencies could be materially adversely affected 

 

vf’s balance sheet includes a significant amount of intangible assets and goodwill a decline in the fair value of an intangible asset or of a business unit could result in an asset impairment charge which would be recorded as an operating expense in vf’s consolidated statement of income and could be material 

 

we evaluate goodwill and trademark intangible assets that are not amortized for possible impairment at least annually in addition intangible assets that are being amortized are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value might not be recoverable for these impairment tests we use various valuation methods to estimate the fair value of our business units and intangible assets if the fair value of an asset is less than its carrying value we would recognize an impairment charge for the difference during 2010 and 2009 we recognized goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges totaling 2017 million and 1220 million respectively 

 

at december 2010 vf had indefinitelived intangible assets of approximately 10 billion related to trademarks and 12 billion of goodwill on its balance sheet in addition vf had approximately 05 billion of intangible assets that are being amortized goodwill and intangible assets combined represent 41 of vf’s total assets and 69 of stockholders’ equity 

 

it is possible that we could have an impairment charge for goodwill or trademark intangible assets in future periods if i overall economic conditions in 2011 or future years vary from our current assumptions ii business conditions or our strategies for a specific business unit change from our current assumptions iii investors require higher rates of return on equity investments in the marketplace or iv enterprise values of comparable publicly traded companies or of actual sales transactions of comparable companies were to decline resulting in lower comparable multiples of revenues and ebitda and accordingly lower implied values of goodwill and intangible assets a future impairment charge for goodwill or intangible assets could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

 

vf’s defined benefit pension plans were underfunded at the end of 2010 

 

vf’s defined benefit pension plans were underfunded by 2074 million at the end of 2010 this underfunding resulted from the decline in market value of the qualified plans’ investment portfolios resulting from the global financial and credit crisis that began near the end of 2007 and a reduction in the discount rate used to determine the present value of the plans’ projected benefit obligations differences between actual results and amounts estimated using actuarial assumptions eg investment returns discount rate mortality are deferred and amortized as part of future years’ pension cost deferred actuarial losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity totaled 4152 million at december 2010 primarily because of the amortization of these deferred actuarial losses our pension cost was 676 million in 2010 and 980 million in 2009 a sharp increase from 108 million in 2008 we made 100 million of discretionary contributions to our pension plans during 2010 and 200 million in 2009 which increased the funded status of our pension plans to 85 at the end of 2010 

 

a further decrease in the value of our pension plans’ assets or a decrease in the discount rate used to value the plans’ liabilities to participants could result in a further decrease in the plans’ funded status in that case vf would recognize additional pension liabilities and additional charges to stockholders’ equity in our consolidated balance sheet and higher pension expense in future years further vf could be required to make additional cash funding contributions to return the funded status of the pension plans to a higher level over the next few years

overview 

 

vf corporation is a worldwide leader in branded lifestyle apparel and related products management’s vision is to grow vf by building leading lifestyle brands that excite consumers around the world lifestyle brands representative of the activities that consumers aspire to generally extend across multiple geographic markets and product categories and therefore have greater opportunities for growth 

 

vf owns a diverse portfolio of brands with strong market positions in many consumer product categories in addition we market occupational apparel to resellers and major corporate and governmental customers vf has a broad customer base with products distributed through leading specialty stores upscale and traditional department stores national chains and mass merchants plus directtoconsumer channels 

 

vf’s businesses are grouped by product categories and by brands within those product categories for internal financial reporting used by management these groupings of businesses within vf are referred to as “coalitions” and are the basis for vf’s reportable business segments as described below 

 

  

impact of the current global economic environment 

 

the global recession from late 2007 through mid2009 was the longest and most severe recession in the last several decades this recession with its flattofalling consumer income levels sharp declines in real estate and securities markets volatility in commodity and currency markets significant increases in unemployment numerous retailer and other bankruptcies and unprecedented government stimulus programs led to a decline in consumer spending that impacted vf as well as most other companies 

 

the economic recovery in most developed countries over the last 18 months has been slow consumer spending representing about 70 of the us economy has advanced slowly during this period and has only recently returned to prerecession levels some of these headwinds will continue to impact vf and our competitors 

 

in response to the challenging market conditions of the last three years we have been aggressive in controlling our costs and operating with lean inventory levels our balance sheet cash flows from operations and liquidity have remained strong and we have continued to invest in our brands during 2010 we increased our investments in advertising and product development by over 100 million compared with the prior year these investments were 

very targeted and were concentrated in our brands having the greatest opportunities for growth including the north face ®  vans ® and our businesses in asia we will continue this higher level of investment spending during 2011 as we believe the strength of our brands is fundamental to our success in this economic climate 

 

highlights of 2010 

 

following are the notable actions and achievements in 2010 

 

  

analysis of results of operations 

 

consolidated statements of income 

 

the following table presents a summary of the changes in our total revenues during the last two years 

 

 

total revenues consist of net sales of products and royalty income from licensees revenues increased 7 in 2010 led by 14 growth in our outdoor  action sports businesses in addition while not to the same extent revenues increased in most of our other businesses revenues declined 6 in 2009 with 2 of the decline due to foreign currency translation additional details on revenues are provided in the section titled “information by business segment” 

 

in translating foreign currencies into the us dollar the stronger us dollar in relation to the functional currencies of those countries where vf conducts the majority of its international business primarily europeeurobased countries negatively impacted revenue by 21 million in 2010 relative to 2009 and 156 million in 2009 relative to 2008 the weighted average translation rates for the euro were 133 139 and 147 per euro for 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

 

the following table presents the percentage relationship to total revenues for components of our consolidated statements of income 

 

 

 

approximately 13 of the improvement in gross margin percentage in 2010 over 2009 was due to i a greater percentage of our revenues coming from higher gross margin businesses including our directtoconsumer operations and ii other areas of operational improvements including retail and inventory efficiencies the remaining 11 improvement resulted from product cost reductions 

 

the gross margin percentage increased 14 in 2009 over 2008 from the impact of our growing directtoconsumer operations which have gross margin percentages higher than vf averages in addition gross margins improved in 2009 due to lower levels and improved profitability on disposal of distressed inventories these increases were partially offset by lower gross margins in our european jeanswear and imagewear businesses see the “information by business segment” section below 

 

marketing administrative and general expenses as a percent of revenues increased 10 in 2010 over 2009 due to increased marketing spending in 2010 as discussed above and 04 due to higher growth than average in our directtoconsumer business which has a higher expense ratio than our wholesale business these increases were partially offset by lower domestic pension expense which reduced the ratio by 06 in 2010 compared with 2009 

 

marketing administrative and general expenses as a percent of revenues increased 12 in 2009 over 2008 due to higher domestic pension expense and 11 due to higher growth than average in our directtoconsumer business the 2009 comparison benefited from i the absence of charges from cost reduction actions which increased marketing administrative and general expenses by 07 as a percent of revenues in 2008 and ii the benefit of these actions and other spending reductions in 2009 

 

we completed our annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinitelived trademark intangible assets in the fourth quarter of 2010 in conjunction with finalizing our strategic plan based on our assessment of current and expected economic conditions trends and forecasted cash flows at each business unit and assumptions representative of those that market participants would make in valuing our business units vf management determined that the carrying values of its goodwill and trademark intangible asset at its 7 for all mankind ® business unit exceeded the respective fair values accordingly vf recorded a noncash impairment charge totaling 2017 million 1418 million net of related income tax benefits to reduce the carrying values of goodwill and the trademark intangible asset of this business unit to their fair values this charge represents all of the recorded goodwill for the 7 for all mankind ® business unit and 40 of the consolidated goodwill and nonamortized trademark balances for this business unit similarly as a result of our annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2009 vf management determined that the carrying values of goodwill at its reef ®  nautica ®  and lucy ® business units and trademark intangible assets at its reef ® and lucy ® business units exceeded their respective fair values accordingly vf recorded noncash impairment charges totaling 1220 million 1144 million net of related income tax benefits to 

reduce these carrying values to their fair values of this total reef ® represented 367 million nautica ® represented 585 million and lucy ® represented 268 million 23 14 and 26 respectively of each businesses’ combined goodwill and nonamortized trademark intangible asset balances for additional information see notes f g and t to the consolidated financial statements and the “critical accounting policies and estimates” section below 

 

interest income was flat in 2010 compared with 2009 but decreased 39 million in 2009 from 2008 primarily due to lower interest rates interest expense decreased 82 million in 2010 from 2009 due to reduced shortterm borrowing levels and the payment of 200 million of notes that matured in 2010 the 81 million decline in interest expense in 2009 from 2008 was due primarily to lower shortterm borrowing levels average interestbearing debt outstanding totaled 1136 million for 2010 1364 million for 2009 and 1454 million for 2008 with shortterm borrowings representing 40 162 and 212 of average debt outstanding for the respective years the weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt was 66 for 2010 61 for 2009 and 63 for 2008 the increase in the weighted average interest rate in 2010 resulted from a reduction in commercial paper borrowings which bear lower interest rates 

 

in connection with the vans mexico acquisition we recognized a 57 million gain in miscellaneous income during 2010 from remeasuring our previous 50 investment in the joint venture to fair value 

 

excluding the impairment charges discussed above the tax rates for 2010 and 2009 were 249 and 262 respectively compared with 289 in 2008 during 2010 we recorded tax benefits of 205 million related to prior years’ refund claims and tax credits and 56 million of tax benefits related to expirations of statutes of limitations in international jurisdictions where accruals for uncertain tax positions had been recorded these items lowered our 2010 annual tax rate by 27 during 2009 we recorded tax benefits of 175 million related to favorable outcomes of us state tax audits and from expirations of statutes of limitations in several us state and international jurisdictions where accruals for uncertain tax positions had been recorded these items lowered our 2009 annual tax rate by 23 during 2008 we recorded tax benefits of i 246 million related primarily to favorable outcomes of foreign tax audits expirations of statutes of limitations in foreign jurisdictions and other state tax benefits and ii 115 million to reflect updated assessments of previously accrued amounts these items lowered our 2008 annual tax rate by 43 after considering the impact of the unusual items discussed above the remaining declines in the effective income tax rates in 2010 from 2009 and in 2009 from 2008 were primarily attributed to growth in our international businesses in jurisdictions having effective tax rates that are substantially lower than rates in the united states 

 

net income attributable to vf corporation increased to 5714 million in 2010 from 4613 million in 2009 while earnings per share increased to 518 in 2010 from 413 in 2009 excluding the impairment charges noted above earnings per share were 646 in 2010 and 516 in 2009 the increase in earnings per share in 2010 over 2009 resulted primarily from improved operating performance as discussed in the “information by business segment” section below and lower domestic pension expense which benefited earnings per share in 2010 by 020 these benefits were partially offset by cost reduction actions that negatively impacted earnings per share in 2010 by 009 there were no similar actions taken in 2009 

 

net income attributable to vf corporation decreased to 4613 million in 2009 from 6027 million in 2008 while earnings per share decreased to 413 in 2009 from 542 in 2008 earnings per share in 2009 were 516 excluding impairment charges for goodwill and intangible assets earnings per share in 2009 compared with 2008 were negatively impacted by i higher domestic pension expense of 048 and ii an unfavorable impact of 018 from translating foreign currencies into a stronger us dollar the earnings per share comparison in 2009 benefited from the absence of charges of 030 per share for cost reduction actions taken in 2008 

 

information by business segment 

 

management at each of the coalitions has direct control over and responsibility for its revenues operating income and assets hereinafter termed “coalition revenues” and “coalition profit” respectively vf management evaluates operating performance and makes investment and other decisions based on coalition revenues and coalition profit common costs such as information systems processing retirement benefits and insurance are allocated to the coalitions based on appropriate metrics such as usage or employment 

corporate costs other than costs charged directly to the coalitions impairment charges and net interest expense are not controlled by coalition management and therefore are excluded from the coalition profit performance measure used for internal management reporting see note q to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of our results of operations and other information by coalition along with a reconciliation of coalition profit to income before income taxes to leverage the scale of vf there are a number of functions that are shared across all coalitions accordingly coalition results are not necessarily indicative of operating results that would have been reported had each coalition been an independent standalone entity during the periods presented 

 

the following tables present a summary of the changes in our total revenues and coalition profit by coalition during the last two years 

 

 

 

 

 

operating results of the lucy ® business unit have been reclassified from the contemporary brands coalition to the outdoor  action sports coalition consistent with the change in internal management reporting beginning in 2010 

 

outdoor  action sports 

 

 

this coalition consists of vf’s outdoor and action sportsrelated businesses including the north face ® brand apparel footwear and equipment vans ® performance and casual footwear and apparel jansport ® and eastpak ® 

backpacks and apparel kipling ® bags and accessories napapijri ® outdoorbased sportswear reef ® beachinspired footwear and apparel lucy ® women’s apparel and eagle creek ® adventure travel gear 

 

the outdoor  action sports coalition achieved record revenues operating income and operating margin in 2010 the 14 increase in revenues was driven by growth in the north face ® and vans ® brands of 18 and 20 respectively over the prior year these brands experienced growth in both domestic and international markets directtoconsumer revenues for this coalition rose 20 in 2010 over 2009 with doubledigit growth in the north face ®  vans ®  kipling ®  napapijri ® and lucy ® retail businesses as we benefited from new store openings growth in comp store sales and expansion of our ecommerce business revenues in asia increased 31 in 2010 over the prior year 

 

coalition revenues in 2009 increased slightly on a reported basis compared with 2008 and 3 on a constant currency basis reported global revenues of the north face ® increased by 6 including a negative impact of 3 from foreign currency translation and vans ® increased by 5 including a negative impact of 2 from foreign currency translation in addition revenues in asia increased by more than 50 largely due to increases in the vans ® brand which was just introduced into china in 2008 these increases were offset by the impact of foreign currency translation and revenue declines in the other coalition businesses 

 

the operating margin improvement in 2010 over 2009 was driven by i a 25 increase in gross margin reflecting improvements in retail store performance and improved profitability on the disposal of distressed inventories and ii the leverage of operating expenses on higher revenues these operating margin improvements were partially offset by a significant increase in marketing spending that negatively impacted operating margin comparisons by 12 in 2010 compared with 2009 

 

approximately onehalf of the operating margin improvement in 2009 over 2008 resulted from an increased gross margin with higher margin directtoconsumer revenues making up a larger portion of total coalition revenues in 2009 in addition the 2009 operating margin comparison benefited by 03 from a charge for cost reduction actions taken in 2008 that did not recur in 2009 the remainder of the operating margin improvement in 2009 over 2008 was due to lower spending partially offset by continued investments to expand the directtoconsumer business 

 

jeanswear 

 

 

the jeanswear coalition consists of our global jeanswear businesses led by the wrangler ® and lee ® brands 

 

domestic jeanswear revenues increased 2 in 2010 over 2009 with 3 growth in both our wrangler ® and lee ® brands reflecting the positive impact of new products introduced during the year domestic jeanswear revenues declined 4 in 2009 from 2008 due to a difficult retail environment including the loss of volume from customers who filed for bankruptcy in 2008 and a reduction in noncore riders ® brand plus size and seasonal programs some of which were reinstated in 2010 

 

international jeanswear revenues including europe canada mexico latin america and asia declined 3 in 2010 with lower revenues in europe partially offset by 36 revenue growth in asia and doubledigit growth in all other foreign markets the decline in europe resulted from the decision in 2009 to exit our mass market jeans business in europe as well as continued difficult business conditions in the overall european jeanswear market 

 

jeanswear revenues in international markets declined 18 in 2009 from 2008 with 8 of the decline resulting from the negative impact of foreign currency translation the remainder of the decline was driven by recessionary conditions especially in europe and the mass market jeans business exit in europe these declines were partially offset by a 14 increase in jeanswear revenues in asia 

the improvement in operating margin in 2010 over 2009 resulted from a 26 higher gross margin reflecting i lower product costs particularly in our us jeanswear businesses and ii lower levels of and improved profitability on the disposal of distressed inventories operating margin comparisons in 2010 also benefited from the 2009 exit of the european mass market jeans business which had operating margins that were well below the coalition average these benefits were partially offset by increased marketing spending and charges for cost reduction actions that negatively impacted 2010 operating margin comparisons by 08 and 03 respectively 

 

the jeanswear operating margin in 2009 compared with 2008 benefited by 10 from charges for cost reduction actions taken in 2008 that did not recur in 2009 the negative impact of higher distressed inventory provisions in our european businesses in 2009 was offset by lower spending across the coalition due in part to the 2008 cost reduction actions 

 

imagewear 

 

 

the imagewear coalition consists of vf’s image business occupational apparel and uniforms and licensed sports business licensed high profile sports and lifestyle apparel 

 

image business revenues increased 8 in 2010 over 2009 due to strength in the industrial and protective sectors resulting from the gradual economic recovery and the competitive advantage of our quick response service model licensed sports revenues increased 3 in 2010 over 2009 due primarily to growth in our licensed national football league business 

 

image business revenues declined 17 in 2009 from 2008 due to rising unemployment particularly in the manufacturing and petrochemical sectors licensed sports revenues were down 8 in 2009 from 2008 resulting from lower attendance at sporting events and the overall weak retail environment and the highly discretionary nature of consumer spending on these products 

 

operating margin increased 15 in 2010 over 2009 due to higher gross margins resulting primarily from an improved mix of business the remainder of the increase was driven by improved leverage of operating expenses on a higher level of revenues 

 

operating margin declined in 2009 from 2008 due to revenue declines that negatively impacted the expense to revenue ratio and economic factors that affected obligations under royalty agreements in our licensed sports business 

 

sportswear 

 

 

the sportswear coalition consists of our nautica ® and kipling ® brand businesses in north america the kipling ® brand outside of north america is managed by the outdoor  action sports coalition 

 

sportswear coalition revenues were flat in 2010 compared with 2009 a 2 decline in nautica ® brand revenues during 2010 due to lower volume in our owned outlet stores was offset by 30 growth in our kipling ® brand revenues the increase in kipling ® brand revenues resulted from growth in directtoconsumer revenues performance in specialty stores and the successful launch in early 2010 of a new program that is exclusive with macy’s inc 

the decline in coalition revenues in 2009 from 2008 was driven by a 13 decrease in nautica ® brand revenues resulting from difficult market conditions in the department store channel and lower volume in our owned outlet stores 

 

the sportswear coalition operating margins were flat in 2010 compared with 2009 an improvement in gross margin percentage of 07 resulted from i lower markdown activity in the department store channel and our outlet store channel ii lower levels of excess inventory coming into 2010 and iii a higher percentage of kipling ® revenues which have higher gross margins than the coalition average this improvement was offset by higher marketing spending 

 

the sportswear coalition operating margin improved in 2009 from 2008 due to aggressive cost and inventory reduction actions in our nautica business also the 2009 operating margin comparison benefited by 10 from charges for cost reduction actions taken in 2008 that did not recur in 2009 including the cost for the exit of the nautica ® women’s wholesale sportswear business 

 

contemporary brands 

 

 

this coalition consists of the 7 for all mankind ® brand of premium denim jeanswear and related apparel and the john varvatos ® luxury apparel collection for men this coalition also includes the operating results of the splendid ® and ella moss ® brands comprised of the earnings from our onethird equity investment from june 2008 through march 2009 when the remaining twothirds equity interest was purchased and the consolidated operating results thereafter 

 

the growth in coalition revenues in 2010 resulted from the 2009 acquisition of the splendid ® and ella moss ® brands which contributed an incremental 24 million in revenues in 2010 and 10 revenue growth in our john varvatos ® business these increases were partially offset by a 3 decrease in global 7 for all mankind ® brand revenues reflecting volume declines due to continued soft conditions in the premium denim market expanding the 7 for all mankind ® directtoconsumer business is an important part of our growth strategy for this brand and in 2010 we opened 20 retail stores 

 

the increase in coalition revenues in 2009 was due to the acquisition of the splendid ® and ella moss ® brands this increase was partially offset by an 8 decline in global 7 for all mankind ® brand revenues driven by challenging conditions in the us upper tier department and specialty store channel the 7 for all mankind ® brand grew in asia where revenues nearly doubled and in the brand’s directtoconsumer business where revenues more than tripled 

 

the decline in operating margin in 2010 compared with 2009 was driven by investments in new 7 for all mankind ® retail stores higher marketing spending the writeoff of fixtures at eight underperforming retail stores that had been opened in previous years and lower margins associated with selling excess quantities of inventory the operating margin comparison was also negatively impacted by 15 due to the favorable resolution of a valueadded tax and duty matter during 2009 that did not recur in 2010 these decreases were partially offset by improved operating results in our john varvatos ® business which had a positive operating margin in 2010 after generating operating losses in prior years 

 

operating margins were negatively impacted in 2009 compared with 2008 by volume declines in our 7 for all mankind ® wholesale business that negatively impacted the expense to revenue ratio increased retail investments across the coalition and higher operating losses in 2009 in our john varvatos ® business the 2009 operating margin comparison benefited by 15 from charges in 2008 related to a valueadded tax and duty matter and cost reduction initiatives that did not recur operating margins for the 7 for all mankind ® and splendid ® and ella moss ® brands in 2009 were above the coalition average at 16 and 20 respectively 

other 

 

 

the other business segment includes the vf outlet business which is a group of vfoperated outlet stores in the united states that sell a broad selection of excess quantities of vf products and other branded products revenues and profits of vf products are reported as part of the operating results of the applicable coalitions while revenues and profits of nonvf products which provide a broader selection of merchandise to attract consumer traffic are reported in this business segment while revenues in the other business segment were flat in 2010 compared with 2009 the decline in revenues in 2009 from 2008 was due to the impact of the economic recession on consumer spending 

 

reconciliation of coalition profit to consolidated income before income taxes 

 

there are three types of costs necessary to reconcile total coalition profit as discussed in the preceding paragraphs to income before income taxes these costs discussed below are impairment of goodwill and trademarks interest and corporate and other expenses see also note q to the consolidated financial statements 

 

impairment of goodwill and trademarks and interest expense net were discussed in the previous “consolidated statements of income” section impairment of goodwill and trademarks is excluded from coalition profit as they represent charges that are not a part of the ongoing operations of the respective businesses see the “nongaap financial information” section below interest is excluded from coalition profit because substantially all of our financing costs are managed at the corporate office and are not under the control of coalition management 

 

corporate and other expenses consists of corporate headquarters’ and similar costs that are not apportioned to the operating coalitions these expenses are summarized as follows 

 

 

 

information systems and shared services  — included are costs of our management information systems and our centralized shared services center which includes common financial supply chain human resources and customer management services that support our worldwide operations operating costs of information systems and shared services are charged to the coalitions based on utilization of those services such as minutes of computer processing time number of transactions or number of users costs to develop new computer applications that will be used across vf are not allocated to the coalitions the increase in information systems and shared services costs in 2010 from 2009 resulted from the overall growth of our businesses increased spending related to reconfiguring our western hemisphere sourcing organization and costs associated with changing thirdparty data center providers the decrease in information systems and shared services costs in 2009 from 2008 is primarily due to reductions in thirdparty data center charges and amortization 

 

corporate headquarters’ costs  — headquarters’ costs include compensation and benefits of corporate management and staff certain legal and professional fees and administrative and general expenses which are 

not apportioned to the coalitions the increase in corporate headquarters’ costs in 2010 from 2009 was primarily driven by higher incentive compensation increased contributions to the vf foundation and significantly higher investments in strategy and innovation the decline in corporate headquarters’ costs in 2009 from 2008 was due to reduced spending as part of our cost reduction efforts 

 

trademark maintenance and enforcement  — legal and other costs of registering maintaining and enforcing the majority of vf’s trademarks plus related costs of licensing administration are controlled by a centralized trademark and licensing staff and are not allocated to the coalitions 

 

other  — this category includes i costs that result from corporate programs or corporatemanaged decisions that are not allocated to the business units for internal management reporting ii adjustments to convert the earnings of certain business units using the fifo inventory valuation method for internal reporting to the lifo method for consolidated financial reporting and iii other consolidating adjustments the most significant of which is related to the expense of our centrallymanaged us defined benefit pension plans coalition profit of the business units includes only their current year service cost component of pension expense pension costs totaling 469 million for 2010 and 831 million for 2009 primarily representing amortization of deferred actuarial losses were recorded in “other” expense these costs were not significant in 2008 

 

analysis of financial condition 

 

balance sheets 

 

accounts receivable at december 2010 were in line with the balance at december 2009 increases in accounts receivable related to higher wholesale revenues near the end of 2010 compared with the 2009 period were offset by i an improvement in collections reflected in lower days’ sales outstanding and ii an increase in accounts receivable balances sold as discussed in the “liquidity and cash flows” section below and in note c to the consolidated financial statements 

 

inventories increased 12 at december 2010 over the december 2009 balance due to i expected revenue growth in the first quarter of 2011 compared with the prior year period ii rising inventory costs and iii accelerated purchases of fabric in anticipation of the expected price increases these increases were partially offset by an improvement in our number of days of inventory on hand compared with the end of 2009 

 

property plant and equipment at the end of 2010 was in line with the balance at the end of 2009 as the amount of depreciation expense approximated capital spending in 2010 

 

total intangible assets and goodwill decreased in 2010 due to the impairment charges discussed above amortization of intangible assets and the impact of foreign currency translation partially offset by the addition of intangible assets and goodwill related to the vans mexico acquisition 

 

other assets were higher at december 2010 due to an increase in deferred income tax assets resulting primarily from the goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge discussed above 

 

shortterm borrowings at december 2010 and december 2009 consisted of 366 million and 455 million respectively under international borrowing agreements 

 

the current portion of longterm debt was lower at december 2010 than december 2009 due to the payment of 2000 million of 85 notes upon their maturity in 2010 

 

the increase in accounts payable at december 2010 compared with december 2009 resulted from the timing of inventory purchases and other payments 

 

the increase in accrued liabilities at december 2010 over december 2009 was driven primarily by higher incentive compensation accruals and the overall growth of our businesses 

 

other liabilities at december 2010 decreased from 2009 due to i lower deferred income taxes and ii a reduction in the underfunded status of our defined benefit pension plans at the end of 2010 as discussed in the following paragraph 

the recessionary conditions during 2008 resulted in a significant decline in the value of the investment portfolios of our defined benefit pension plans as a result our pension liability was over 400 million higher than pension assets at december 2008 to improve the funded status of our pension plans we contributed over 200 million to these plans during 2009 and over 100 million in 2010 accordingly the plans’ underfunded status reported in our 2009 and 2010 consolidated balance sheets was reduced to 2509 million and 2074 million respectively see note m to the consolidated financial statements and the “critical accounting policies and estimates” section below for a discussion of liability and equity balances related to defined benefit pension plans 

 

liquidity and cash flows 

 

the financial condition of vf is reflected in the following 

 

 

 

for the ratio of debt to total capital debt is defined as shortterm and longterm borrowings and total capital is defined as debt plus stockholders’ equity our ratio of net debt to total capital with net debt defined as debt less cash and equivalents and total capital defined as net debt plus stockholders’ equity was 45 at the end of 2010 

 

vf’s primary source of liquidity is its strong cash flow provided by operating activities cash generated from operations which was 10013 million in 2010 9735 million in 2009 and 6795 million in 2008 is primarily dependent on the level of net income changes in accounts receivable investments in inventories and other working capital components net income was 5735 million 4585 million and 6028 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively net income in 2010 and 2009 were negatively impacted by noncash pretax impairment charges for goodwill and intangible assets of 2017 million and 1220 million respectively 

 

operating cash flow for 2010 and 2009 included 1000 million and 2000 million respectively of discretionary contributions to our us qualified defined benefit pension plan there were no contributions to this plan in 2008 vf has adequate liquidity to meet future funding requirements we will continue to evaluate the funded status of our retirement plans and future funding requirements 

 

the significant change in deferred income taxes for 2010 was driven by an increase in deferred income tax assets resulting primarily from the goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges in 2010 

 

the net change in operating asset and liability components provided an increase to operating cash flow of 904 million in 2010 and 2281 million in 2009 in contrast to reducing operating cash flows by 1506 million in 2008 the positive cash generation from these components in 2010 was due to higher incentive compensation accruals and other accrued liabilities resulting from business growth in 2010 the increase in accounts payable at the end of 2010 was primarily offset by higher inventory levels 

 

the positive cash generation from these components in 2009 was driven by our aggressive management of inventory levels and the sale of selected accounts receivable discussed in the paragraph below the changes in operating cash flows from other current assets during 2009 resulted from an unusually high amount of prepaid income taxes at the end of 2008 operating cash flow in 2008 benefited from an additional week of collections on accounts receivable in the 53 rd week of the fiscal year in that collections sharply exceeded credit sales in that week 

 

in 2009 vf entered into an agreement to sell selected trade accounts receivable on a nonrecourse basis to a financial institution this agreement allows vf to have up to 1925 million of accounts receivable held by the financial institution at any point in time after the sale vf continues to service and collect these accounts receivable on behalf of the financial institution but does not retain any other interests in the receivables at the end of 2010 and 2009 accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheets had been reduced by 1123 million and 742 million respectively related to balances sold under this program net proceeds of this accounts receivable sale program are recognized as part of the change in accounts receivable in cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows this program resulted in increases of 381 million and 742 million in operating cash flow in 2010 and 2009 respectively 

vf will rely on its continued strong cash generation to finance ongoing operations as well as most other circumstances that may arise vf has significant existing liquidity from its available cash balances and debt capacity supported by its strong credit rating at the end of 2010 9833 million was available for borrowing under vf’s 10 billion senior unsecured domestic revolving bank credit facility with 167 million of standby letters of credit issued under the agreement this credit facility is used primarily to support our seasonal commercial paper borrowings also at the end of 2010 €2500 million us dollar equivalent of 3342 million was available for borrowing under vf’s senior unsecured international revolving bank credit facility 

 

vf’s liquidity position is also enhanced by its favorable credit agency ratings which allow for access to additional capital at competitive rates at the end of 2010 vf’s longterm debt ratings were ‘a minus’ by standard  poor’s ratings services and ‘a3’ by moody’s investors service and commercial paper ratings were ‘a2’ and ‘prime2’ respectively by those rating agencies both agencies have a ‘stable’ outlook for vf existing longterm debt agreements do not contain acceleration of maturity clauses based solely on changes in credit ratings however for the 6000 million of senior notes issued in 2007 if there were a change in control of vf and as a result of the change in control the notes were rated below investment grade by recognized rating agencies then vf would be obligated to repurchase the notes at 101 of the aggregate principal amount of notes repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest 

 

cash of 383 million 2123 million and 934 million was used for acquisitions in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively which is net of cash balances in the acquired companies these acquisitions were funded with existing vf cash balances 

 

capital expenditures were 1116 million in 2010 compared with 859 million in 2009 and 1242 million in 2008 capital expenditures in each of these years primarily related to our retail store rollout distribution network and information systems we expect that capital spending could reach 225 million in 2011 reflecting the need for office and distribution space for our expanding international and domestic outdoor businesses as well as an accelerated retail store opening plan this spending will be funded by cash flow from operations 

 

during 2010 2009 and 2008 vf purchased 51 million 16 million and 20 million shares respectively of its common stock in open market transactions the cost of these transactions was 4118 million 1120 million and 1497 million with an average price of 8111 in 2010 7180 in 2009 and 7486 in 2008 under its current authorization from the board of directors vf may purchase an additional 66 million shares we will continue to evaluate future share repurchases considering funding required for business acquisitions our common stock price and levels of stock option exercises 

 

cash dividends totaled 243 per common share in 2010 compared with 237 in 2009 and 233 in 2008 our dividend payout rate was 469 of our diluted earnings per share in 2010 574 in 2009 and 430 in 2008 376 in 2010 and 460 in 2009 excluding the effects of the noncash goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges in those years on a longer term basis we expect to pay dividends of approximately 40 of our diluted earnings per share the current indicated annual dividend rate for 2011 is 252 per share 

following is a summary of vf’s contractual obligations and commercial commitments at the end of 2010 that will require the use of funds 

 

 

 

 

  

we have other financial commitments at the end of 2010 that are not included in the above table but may require the use of funds under certain circumstances 

 

 39 

 

  

during 2010 vf used cash flows from operations to meet its obligations when due and for seasonal needs limited issuance of commercial paper there were no borrowings under our domestic or international bank facilities during the year credit market conditions and the general contraction of liquidity in the united states and global capital markets during the second half of 2008 and continuing into 2009 had a significant impact on the ability of many companies to access the commercial paper and other capital markets vf was able to issue commercial paper for seasonal working capital needs during this period reflecting our investment grade credit rating if the commercial paper markets were not available vf has a total of 13 billion of liquidity available under its domestic and international revolving bank credit agreements that do not expire until october 2012 management believes that vf’s cash balances and funds provided by operating activities as well as unused bank credit lines additional borrowing capacity and access to equity markets taken as a whole provide i adequate liquidity to meet all of its current and longterm obligations when due ii adequate liquidity to fund capital expenditures and to maintain our dividend payout policy and iii flexibility to meet investment opportunities that may arise 

 

we do not participate in transactions with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships established to facilitate offbalance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes 

 

risk management 

 

vf is exposed to risks in the ordinary course of business we regularly assess and manage our exposures to these risks through our operating and financing activities and when appropriate by i taking advantage of naturally offsetting exposures within vf ii purchasing insurance from commercial carriers or iii the use of derivative financial instruments some of our potential risks are discussed below 

 

insured risks  — we selfinsure a substantial portion of our employee group medical worker’s compensation vehicle property director and officer and general liability exposures and purchase insurance from highly rated commercial carriers for losses in excess of retained exposures 

 

cash and equivalents risks  — vf had 7922 million of cash and equivalents at the end of 2010 which includes demand deposits institutional money market funds that invest in obligations issued or guaranteed by the us or foreign governments and shortterm time deposits of foreign commercial banks we continually monitor the credit ratings of vf’s financial institutions similarly we monitor the credit quality of cash equivalents and fixed income investments in our defined benefit pension plan portfolio 

 

defined benefit pension plan risks  — vf is subject to funding and earnings risks of its defined benefit pension plans vf’s pension plans were substantially fully funded at the end of 2007 at the end of 2010 the plans are underfunded due primarily to substantial investment portfolio losses incurred in 2008 and an increase in projected benefit obligations because of a decline in the discount rate used to value those obligations declines in the funded status of our plans were offset in part by vf contributions of over 100 million to the plans during 2010 and over 200 million during 2009 as well as investment performance that has exceeded our actuarial return assumption accordingly at the end of 2010 vf has a 2074 million liability representing the underfunded status of the plans 12116 million of plan assets compared with a projected benefit obligation of 14190 million and a 4338 million pretax balance in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders’ equity we will continue to evaluate the funded status of our retirement plans and future funding requirements further as more fully described in the “critical accounting policies and estimates” section below we have begun to take actions that will limit the risk in investments of our domestic defined benefit pension plans and reduce the yeartoyear variability of our domestic plans’ funded status and resulting pension expense 

 

interest rate risks  — we limit the risk of interest rate fluctuations by managing our mix of fixed and variable interest rate debt in addition we may use derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk since all of our longterm debt has fixed interest rates our interest rate exposure relates to changes in interest rates on our variable rate shortterm borrowings which averaged approximately 45 million during 2010 however any change in interest rates would also affect interest income earned on vf’s cash equivalents based on the low levels of 

variable rate borrowings and the levels of cash equivalents during 2010 the effect on reported net income of a hypothetical 10 change in interest rates would not be significant 

 

foreign currency exchange rate risks  — vf is a global enterprise subject to the risk of foreign currency fluctuations approximately 30 of our revenues in 2010 were generated in international markets most of our foreign businesses operate in functional currencies other than the us dollar if the us dollar strengthened relative to the euro or other foreign currencies where we have operations there would be a negative impact on vf’s operating results upon translation of those foreign operating results into the us dollar we do not hedge the translation of foreign currency operating results into the us dollar however we do hedge foreign currency transactions as discussed later in this section 

 

assets and liabilities in these foreign businesses are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates we have an international bank credit agreement that provides for up to €2500 million us dollar equivalent of 3342 million at december 2010 of eurodenominated borrowings although there were no borrowings under this agreement during 2010 borrowings under the agreement could be used to reduce the exposure to currency rate changes for our eurodenominated net assets net advances to and investments in our foreign businesses in europe latin america and asia are considered to be longterm and accordingly foreign currency transaction effects on those longterm advances are deferred as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders’ equity we do not hedge net investments in foreign subsidiaries which could impact the us dollar value of those investments 

 

we monitor net foreign currency market exposures and enter into derivative foreign currency contracts to hedge the effects of exchange rate fluctuations for a significant portion of our forecasted foreign currency cash flows or specific foreign currency transactions use of these financial instruments allows us to reduce the overall exposure to risks from exchange rate fluctuations on vf’s cash flows and earnings since gains and losses on these contracts will offset losses and gains on the cash flows or transactions being hedged our practice is to hedge a portion of net foreign currency cash flows forecasted for periods of up to 20 months relating to crossborder inventory purchases production costs product sales and intercompany royalty payments by buying or selling primarily us dollar contracts against various currencies currently we use only forward exchange contracts but may use options or collars in the future 

 

for cash flow hedging contracts outstanding at the end of 2010 if there were a hypothetical change in foreign currency exchange rates of 10 compared with rates at the end of 2010 it would result in a change in fair value of those contracts of approximately 80 million however any change in the fair value of the hedging contracts would result in an offsetting change in the fair value of the underlying balance sheet positions impacted by the currency rate changes 

 

counterparty risks  — vf is exposed to creditrelated losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to derivative hedging instruments to manage this risk we have established counterparty credit guidelines and enter into derivative transactions only with financial institutions with ‘a minusa3’ investment grade credit ratings or better we continually monitor the credit rating of and our hedging positions with each counterparty additionally we utilize a portfolio of financial institutions to minimize our exposure to potential counterparty defaults and will adjust our positions if necessary we also monitor counterparty risk for derivative contracts within our defined benefit pension plans 

 

commodity price risks  — vf is exposed to market risks for the pricing of cotton and other fibers which may impact fabric prices to manage risks of fabric prices we negotiate prices for denim and other fabrics in advance when possible we have not historically managed commodity price exposures by using derivative instruments 

 

deferred compensation and related investment security risks  — vf has nonqualified deferred compensation plans in which liabilities to the plans’ participants are based on the market values of investment funds selected by the participants the risk of changes in the market values of the participants’ investment selections is hedged by vf’s investment in a portfolio of securities that substantially mirror the participants’ investment selections increases and decreases in deferred compensation liabilities are substantially offset by corresponding increases and decreases in the market value of vf’s investments resulting in an insignificant net exposure to our operating results and financial position 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

we have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to accurately and fairly report vf’s operating results and financial position in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states we apply these accounting policies in a consistent manner our significant accounting policies are summarized in note a to the consolidated financial statements 

 

the application of these accounting policies requires that we make estimates and assumptions about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses contingent assets and liabilities and related disclosures these estimates assumptions and judgments are based on historical experience current trends and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis because our business cycle is relatively short ie from the date that we place an order to manufacture or purchase inventory until that inventory is sold and the trade receivable is collected actual results related to most estimates are known within a few months after any balance sheet date in addition we may retain outside specialists to assist us in valuations of business acquisitions impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets equity compensation pension benefits and selfinsured liabilities if actual results ultimately differ from previous estimates the revisions are included in results of operations in the period in which the actual amounts become known 

 

we believe the following accounting policies involve the most significant management estimates assumptions and management judgments used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements or are the most sensitive to change from outside factors we have discussed the application of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 

 

inventories 

 

our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value cost includes all material labor and overhead costs incurred to manufacture or purchase the finished goods overhead allocated to manufactured product is based on the normal capacity of our plants and does not include amounts related to idle capacity or abnormal production inefficiencies market value is based on a detailed review at each business unit at least quarterly of all inventories on the basis of individual styles or individual stylesizecolor stockkeeping units “skus” to identify slow moving or excess products discontinued and tobediscontinued products and offquality merchandise this review matches inventory on hand plus current production and purchase commitments with current and expected future sales orders for those units in inventory that are identified as slowmoving or excess or offquality we estimate their market value based on historical experience and current realization trends this evaluation performed using a systematic and consistent methodology requires forecasts of future demand market conditions and selling prices if the forecasted market value on an individual style or sku basis is less than cost we provide an allowance to reflect the lower value of that inventory this methodology recognizes inventory exposures on an individual style or sku basis at the time such losses are evident rather than at the time goods are actually sold historically these estimates of future demand and selling prices have not varied significantly from actual results due to our timely identification and rapid disposal of these reduced value inventories 

 

physical inventory counts are taken on a regular basis we provide for estimated inventory losses that have likely occurred since the last physical inventory date historically our physical inventory shrinkage has not been significant 

 

longlived assets 

 

we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to the fair values of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed with any excess purchase price recorded as goodwill we evaluate fair value using three valuation techniques — the replacement cost market and income methods — and weight the valuation methods based on what is most appropriate in the circumstances the process of assigning fair values particularly to acquired intangible assets is highly subjective 

 

our depreciation policies for property plant and equipment reflect judgments on their estimated economic lives and residual value if any our amortization policies for intangible assets reflect judgments on the estimated 

amounts and duration of future cash flows expected to be generated by those assets in evaluating expected benefits to be received for customerrelated intangible assets we consider historical attrition patterns for various groups of customers for licenserelated intangible assets we consider historical trends and anticipated license renewal periods based on our experience in renewing or extending similar arrangements regardless of whether there are explicit renewal provisions 

 

we review property and definitelived intangible assets for possible impairment on an ongoing basis to determine if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable we test for possible impairment at the asset or asset group level which is the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent we measure recoverability of the carrying value of an asset or asset group by comparison with estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if the forecasted total of undiscounted cash flows exceeds the carrying value of the asset there is no impairment charge if the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset we estimate the fair value of the asset based on the present value of its future cash flows and recognize an impairment charge for the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value 

 

indefinitelived intangible assets consisting of major trademarks and goodwill are not subject to amortization rather we evaluate those assets for possible impairment as of the beginning of the fourth quarter as part of our annual strategic planning process or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of an asset may exceed its fair value fair value of an indefinitelived trademark intangible asset is based on an income approach using the relieffromroyalty method under this method forecasted global revenues for products sold with the trademark are assigned a royalty rate that would be charged to license the trademark in lieu of ownership from an independent party and fair value is the present value of those forecasted royalties avoided by owning the trademark if the fair value of the trademark intangible asset exceeds its carrying value there is no impairment charge if the fair value of the trademark is less than its carrying value an impairment charge would be recognized for the difference 

 

we assess the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill at each reporting unit having goodwill using the required twostep approach our reporting units are either our coalitions or a business unit if discrete financial information is available and reviewed by coalition management two or more business units may be aggregated for impairment testing if they have similar economic characteristics in the first step of the goodwill impairment test we compare the carrying value of a business unit including its recorded goodwill to the fair value of the business unit we estimate the fair value of a business unit using both incomebased and marketbased valuation methods the principal method used is an incomebased method in which the business unit’s forecasted future cash flows are discounted to their present value in the marketbased valuation method the fair value of a business unit is estimated using multiples of revenues and of earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” for i a group of comparable public companies and ii recent transactions if any involving comparable companies based on the range of fair values developed from the income and marketbased methods we determine the appropriate estimated fair value for the business unit if the fair value of the business unit exceeds its carrying value the goodwill is not impaired and no further review is required however if the fair value of the business unit is less than its carrying value we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the impairment charge if any the second step involves a hypothetical allocation of the fair value of the business unit to its net tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill as if the business unit were newly acquired which results in an implied fair value of the goodwill the amount of the impairment charge is the excess of the recorded goodwill over the implied fair value of the goodwill 

 

the incomebased fair value methodology requires management’s assumptions and judgments regarding economic conditions in the markets in which we operate and conditions in the capital markets many of which are outside of management’s control at the business unit level fair value estimation requires management’s assumptions and judgments regarding the effects of overall economic conditions on the specific business unit 

along with assessment of the business unit’s strategies and forecasts of future cash flows forecasts of individual business unit cash flows involve management’s estimates and assumptions regarding 

 

  

under the marketbased fair value methodology judgment is required in evaluating market multiples and recent transactions management believes that the assumptions used for its impairment tests are representative of those that would be used by market participants performing similar valuations of our business units 

 

in our 2010 evaluation of goodwill and indefinitelived trademark intangible assets we concluded that the carrying values of goodwill and of trademark intangible assets at our 7 for all mankind ® business unit exceeded their respective fair values based on the analysis of current and expected future economic conditions in conjunction with finalizing our strategic plan in the fourth quarter of 2010 accordingly we recognized impairment charges in our 2010 consolidated statement of income of 1952 million to write down the carrying value of the goodwill and 66 million to write down the carrying value of the nonamortized trademark intangible assets similarly in the prior year we concluded that the carrying values of goodwill at our reef ®  nautica ® and lucy ® business units and the carrying values of trademark intangible assets at our reef ® and lucy ® business units exceeded their respective fair values accordingly we recognized impairment charges in our 2009 consolidated statement of income of 1019 million to write down the carrying value of their goodwill and 201 million to write down the carrying value of their trademark intangible assets the noncash charges of 2017 million in 2010 and 1220 million in 2009 did not have a significant impact on our financial position or debt covenants and no impact on our liquidity the charges were based on estimates and judgments changes to the fair value assumptions potentially would have resulted in different goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges see notes f g and t of the consolidated financial statements for additional information about the impairment charges recorded for these business units 

 

at the date of our most recent impairment test except for the 7 for all mankind ® business unit discussed above and the splendid and ella moss ® business unit discussed below the estimated fair value of each of our business units exceeded its respective carrying value by at least 15 and the estimated fair value of each indefinitelived trademark intangible asset exceeded its respective carrying value by at least 20 accordingly no other goodwill or trademark impairment charges were recorded the splendid ® and ella moss ® business unit has been part of our contemporary brands coalition since our acquisition of those brands in 2009 the splendid ® and ella moss ® brands are premiumpriced lifestyle brands marketed to upscale department and specialty stores in addition the rollout of owned stores is a significant component in the growth model for these brands although the splendid ® and ella moss ® brands have primarily performed as planned since their acquisition there has not been significant growth in fair value of the business accordingly at october 3 2010 the date of our annual impairment test the business unit’s fair value was 3042 million which exceeded its carrying value by 7 goodwill in this business unit was 1424 million further the estimated fair value of the trademarks of this business unit exceeded their recorded amount 989 million by 19 

 

it is possible that our conclusions regarding impairment or recoverability of goodwill or trademark intangible assets in any business unit could change in future periods if for example i our businesses do not perform as projected ii overall economic conditions in 2011 or future years vary from our current assumptions iii business conditions or our strategies for a specific business unit change from our current assumptions iv investors require higher rates of return on equity investments in the marketplace or v enterprise values of comparable publicly 

traded companies or actual sales transactions of comparable companies were to decline resulting in lower multiples of revenues and ebitda a future impairment charge for goodwill or intangible assets could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

 

stock options 

 

we use a lattice optionpricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees and nonemployee members of the board of directors we believe that a lattice model provides a refined estimate of the fair value of options because it can incorporate i historical option exercise patterns and multiple assumptions about future option exercise patterns for each of several groups of option holders and ii inputs that vary over time such as assumptions for interest rates and volatility we performed an annual review of all assumptions and believe that the assumptions employed in the valuation of each option grant are reflective of our outstanding options and underlying common stock and of our groups of option participants our lattice valuation is based on the assumptions listed in note o to the consolidated financial statements 

 

one of the critical assumptions in the valuation process is estimating the expected average life of the options before they are exercised for each option grant we based our estimates on evaluations of the historical and expected option exercise patterns for each of the groups of option holders that have historically exhibited different option exercise patterns these evaluations included i voluntary stock option exercise patterns based on a combination of changes in the price of vf common stock and periods of time that options are outstanding before exercise and ii involuntary exercise patterns resulting from turnover retirement and mortality 

 

volatility is another critical assumption requiring judgment we based our estimate of future volatility on a combination of implied and historical volatility implied volatility was based on shortterm 6 to 9 months publicly traded nearthemoney options on vf common stock we measure historical volatility over a ten year period corresponding to the contractual term of the options using daily stock prices our assumption for valuation purposes was that expected volatility starts at a level equal to the implied volatility and then transitions to the historical volatility over the remainder of the ten year option term 

 

pension obligations 

 

vf sponsors a qualified defined benefit pension plan covering most fulltime domestic employees employed before 2005 and an unfunded supplemental defined benefit plan that provides benefits in excess of the limitations imposed by income tax regulations vf also sponsors defined benefit plans covering selected international employees the selection of actuarial assumptions for determining our projected pension benefit liabilities and our annual pension expense is significant due to the long time period over which benefits are accrued and paid we annually update participant demographics and the expected amount and timing of benefit payments we review annually the principal economic actuarial assumptions summarized in note m to the consolidated financial statements and modify them based on current rates and trends we also periodically review and modify as necessary other plan assumptions such as rates of compensation increases retirement termination disability and mortality we believe our assumptions appropriately reflect the participants in and benefits provided by the plans and result in the best estimate of the plans’ future experience actual results may vary from the actuarial assumptions used 

 

one of the critical assumptions used in the actuarial model is the discount rate this discussion of discount rate and the discussion of return on assets in the next paragraph relate specifically to our us pension plans which comprise over 90 of plan assets and projected benefit obligations of our combined domestic and international plans the discount rate is used to estimate the present value of future cash outflows required to meet our projected benefit obligations the discount rate reflects the estimated interest rate that vf could use to settle its projected benefit obligations at the valuation date our discount rate assumption is based on current market interest rates we select our discount rate based on matching high quality corporate bond yields to the timing of projected benefit payments to participants in our us pension plans we use the population of us corporate bonds rated ‘aa’ by moody’s investors service or if a moody’s rating is not available bonds rated ‘aa’ by two other recognized rating services from this population of over 600 such bonds having at least 50 million outstanding that are noncallablenonputtable unless with makewhole provisions we exclude the highest and lowest yielding bonds the plans’ 

projected benefit payments are matched to current market interest rates over the expected payment period and a present value is developed that produces a single discount rate that recognizes our plans’ distinct liability characteristics we believe that those ‘aa’ rated issues meet the “high quality” intent of the applicable accounting standards and that our 2010 discount rate of 565 appropriately reflects current market conditions and the longterm nature of projected benefit payments to participants in our domestic pension plans this lower discount rate compared with the rate of 605 at the end of 2009 reflects the general decline in yields of us government obligations and high quality corporate bonds during 2010 the discount rate for our plans may differ from the rates used by other companies because of longer expected duration of benefit payments reflecting i the higher percentage of female participants with a longer life expectancy and ii the higher percentage of inactive participants who will not begin receiving vested benefits for many years 

 

another critical assumption of the actuarial model is the expected longterm rate of return on investments our investment objective is to maximize the longterm return through a diversified portfolio of assets with an acceptable level of risk these risks include market interest rate credit liquidity and foreign securities risks investment assets consist of domestic and international equity corporate and governmental fixed income real estate and commodity securities we develop a projected rate of return for each of our investment asset classes based on many factors including recent and historical returns the estimated inflation rate the premium to be earned in excess of a riskfree return the premium for equity risk and the premium for longer duration fixed income securities the weighted average projected longterm rates of return of the various assets held by the qualified plan provide the basis for the expected longterm rate of return actuarial assumption our rate of return assumption was 775 in 2010 and 800 in 2009 and 2008 although we have not changed the overall target mix of investments we have over the last two years altered the investment mix to improve investment performance by i adding commodities as an asset class ii increasing the allocation to fixed income investments iii reducing the allocation to equity investments and iv increasing the allocation in equities to more international investments as the qualified plan becomes more fully funded our intent is to lengthen the average duration of fixed income investments to more closely match expected benefit payments so that the effect of interest rate changes on our plan’s investments will be better correlated with the benefit obligations the investments are intended to fund the changes in asset allocation should over time reduce the yeartoyear variability of our domestic plan’s funded status and resulting pension expense based on an evaluation of market conditions projected market returns and planned changes in investment mix we will continue to use a rate of return assumption of 775 for our us plan for 2011 we monitor our plan’s asset allocation to balance anticipated investment returns with risk 

 

the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans is reflected in the balance sheet as the excess or deficiency of pension plan assets compared with projected benefit obligations payable to plan participants the market value of our pension plan investment assets declined significantly in 2008 due to the global credit and financial market crisis which resulted in the plans being underfunded by over 400 million at the end of 2008 during 2009 the underfunded balance declined to 2509 million primarily due to 200 million of discretionary vf cash contributions to the domestic plan and investment earnings on plan assets partially offset by an increase in projected benefit obligations resulting from a reduction in the discount rate during the year during 2010 the underfunded status of the plans improved once again due to 100 million of discretionary vf cash contributions and earnings on plan assets partially offset by an increase in projected benefit obligations due to a further reduction in the discount rate during the year the resulting underfunded status of 2074 million is presented in the 2010 consolidated balance sheet as 59 million of current liabilities and 2015 million of noncurrent liabilities the funded status of our plans recognized in our consolidated balance sheets could change significantly in future years depending on investment portfolio performance the level of vf contributions to the plans changes in the discount rate used to value projected benefit obligations or other factors 

 

differences in any year between actual results and the respective actuarial assumptions eg investment performance discount rates and other assumptions do not affect that year’s pension expense but instead are deferred as unrecognized actuarial gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income in the balance sheet at the end of 2010 there were 4338 million of pretax deferred actuarial losses that resulted primarily from the substantial investment losses incurred during 2008 and the decline in discount rates over the last two years these accumulated unrecognized actuarial losses resulted in an after tax amount of 2661 million in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in our 2010 consolidated balance sheet our policy is to amortize any 

unrecognized actuarial gains and losses to future years’ pension expense as follows amounts which exceed 20 of beginning of the year projected benefit obligations are amortized over five years amounts between the greater of 10 of projected benefit obligations or plan assets and 20 of projected benefit obligations are amortized over the expected average remaining service of active participants and amounts less than the greater of 10 of projected benefit obligations or plan assets are not amortized 

 

pension expense recognized in our financial statements was 676 million in 2010 980 million in 2009 and 108 million in 2008 this compares with the cost of pension benefits actually earned by our covered active employees commonly called “service cost” of 181 million in 2010 and an average of 165 million per year over the last three years pension expense for 2010 and 2009 was significantly higher than the annual service cost because those years included the cost of amortizing the higher level of unrecognized actuarial losses as discussed in the preceding paragraph looking forward we expect our 2011 pension expense to decrease to approximately 50 million due to an increase in plan assets at the end of 2010 

 

the sensitivity of changes in actuarial assumptions on our 2010 pension expense and on projected benefit obligations at the end of 2010 all other factors being equal is illustrated by the following 

 

 

 

as previously mentioned we made a 100 million and a 200 million discretionary contribution to our domestic qualified pension plans during 2010 and 2009 respectively future funding obligations for our defined benefit plans depend on funding requirements under applicable laws and regulations the interest rates used to determine those funding requirements and future performance of the plans’ investment portfolio vf is not required under applicable regulations and does not currently intend to make a contribution to its domestic qualified pension plan during 2011 but does intend to make cash contributions totaling approximately 11 million during 2011 to its other pension plans we believe that vf has sufficient liquidity to make any required contributions to our pension plans in future years 

 

we have taken several steps to reduce the risk and volatility in our pension plans and their impact on our financial statements beginning in 2005 vf’s domestic defined benefit plans were closed to new entrants which did not affect the benefits of existing plan participants at that date or their accrual of future benefits domestic employees hired after 2004 plus employees at certain acquired businesses not covered by those plans participate in a defined contribution plan with vf contributing amounts based on a percentage of eligible compensation as discussed in previous paragraphs we made significant cash contributions to return the plans to a more fully funded status and have modified our investment strategy for plan assets finally we have begun settling some participants’ accrued obligations by allowing a lump sum distribution election on a longerterm basis we believe the yeartoyear variability of our retirement benefit expense should decrease 

 

income taxes 

 

as a global company vf is subject to income taxes and files income tax returns in over 100 domestic and foreign jurisdictions each year the calculation of our income tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations which are subject to legal and factual interpretation and significant management judgment 

 

vf’s income tax returns are regularly examined by federal state and foreign tax authorities and those audits may result in proposed adjustments we have reviewed all issues raised upon examination as well as any exposure for issues that may be raised in future examinations we have evaluated these potential issues under the “more 

likelythannot” standard of the accounting literature a tax position is recognized if it meets this standard and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized such judgments and estimates may change based on audit settlements court cases and interpretation of tax laws and regulations our income tax expense could be materially affected to the extent we prevail in a tax position or when the statute of limitations expires for a tax position for which valuation allowances have been established or to the extent we are required to pay amounts greater than the established valuation allowances we do not currently anticipate any material impact on earnings from the ultimate resolution of income tax uncertainties there are no accruals for general or unknown tax expenses 

 

we have recorded 1787 million of deferred income tax assets related to operating loss and capital loss carryforwards and we have recorded 1372 million of valuation allowances against those assets realization of deferred tax assets related to operating loss and capital loss carryforwards is dependent on future taxable income in specific jurisdictions the amount and timing of which are uncertain and on possible changes in tax laws if we believe that we will not be able to generate sufficient taxable income or capital gains to offset losses during the carryforward periods we have recorded valuation allowances to reduce those deferred tax assets to amounts expected to be ultimately realized in addition we have recorded 127 million of valuation allowances against deferred income tax assets unrelated to operating loss and capital loss carryforwards if in a future period we determine that the amount of deferred tax assets to be realized differs from the net recorded amount we would record an adjustment to income tax expense in that future period 

 

we have not provided us income taxes on a portion of our foreign subsidiaries’ undistributed earnings because these earnings are permanently reinvested in the respective foreign jurisdictions if we were to decide to remit those earnings to the united states in a future period our provision for income taxes could increase in that period 

 

nongaap financial information 

 

vf is a global company that reports financial information in us dollars in accordance with gaap foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations affect the amounts reported by vf from translating our foreign revenues and expenses into us dollars these exchange rate fluctuations can have a significant effect on reported operating results and accordingly can affect the comparability of reported results 

 

to better explain our operating results we use constant currency information which excludes the effects of changes in foreign currency translation rates to provide a framework to assess how our businesses performed relative to prior periods accordingly we have provided supplemental constant currency financial information which is a nongaap financial measure in the “analysis of results of operations” section constant currency information represents the current year reported revenues after adjustment to eliminate the translation effects of changes in exchange rates to calculate coalition revenues on a constant currency basis revenues for the current year period for entities reporting in currencies other than the us dollar are translated into us dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the comparable period of the prior year rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the current year period 

we believe the following supplemental constant currency financial information is useful to investors to facilitate comparisons of operating results and better identify trends in our businesses 

 

 

 

 

 

above amounts may not add due to rounding 

 

also in the “analysis of results of operations” section we discuss operating results excluding the impairment charges for goodwill and intangible assets we believe this nongaap financial information is useful to investors to facilitate comparisons of operating results and better identify trends in our businesses 

 

 

 

 

above amounts may not add due to rounding 

 

these nongaap performance measures should be viewed in addition to and not in lieu of or superior to our financial results calculated in accordance with gaap also this supplemental information may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 

 

cautionary statement on forwardlooking statements 

 

from time to time we may make oral or written statements including statements in this annual report that constitute “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of the federal securities laws these include statements concerning plans objectives projections and expectations relating to vf’s operations or economic performance and assumptions related thereto 

 

forwardlooking statements are made based on our expectations and beliefs concerning future events impacting vf and therefore involve a number of risks and uncertainties we caution that forwardlooking statements are not guarantees and actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forwardlooking statements 

 

known or unknown risks uncertainties and other factors that could cause the actual results of operations or financial condition of vf to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forwardlooking statements are summarized in item 1a of this annual report

for over 100 years vf has grown by offering consumers high quality high value branded apparel and related products in recent years we have been implementing a growth plan that is transforming vf’s mix of business to include more lifestyle brands lifestyle brands are those brands that connect closely with consumers because they are aspirational and inspirational they reflect consumers’ specific activities and interests lifestyle brands generally extend across multiple product categories and have higher than average gross margins accordingly this transformation has included the acquisitions of growing lifestyle brands such as vans ®  reef ®  kipling ®  napapijri ®  7 for all mankind ®  splendid ® and ella moss ®  at the same time we have continued to invest in our other businesses through product line extensions geographic expansion particularly in asia new retail store openings product innovation consumer research and other marketing initiatives in addition an important step in vf’s transformation was the sale in 2007 of our women’s imtimate apparel business which had over 800 million in revenues but lower profit and growth prospects 

 

vf is a highly diversified apparel company — across brands product categories channels of distribution and geographies vf owns a broad portfolio of brands in the jeanswear outerwear packs footwear sportswear and occupational apparel categories these products are marketed to consumers shopping in specialty stores upscale and traditional department stores national chains and mass merchants a growing portion of our revenues currently 17 are derived from sales directly to consumers through vfoperated retail stores and internet sites a global company vf derives 30 of its revenues from outside the united states primarily in europe asia canada and latin america vf products are also sold in some countries through licensees and distributors to provide many types of products across numerous channels of distribution in different geographic areas we balance efficient and flexible internallyowned manufacturing with sourcing of finished goods from independent contractors we utilize stateoftheart technologies for inventory replenishment that enable us to get consumerright products on time to our customers’ shelves 

 

vf’s businesses are organized primarily into product categories and by brands within those categories for both management and internal financial reporting purposes these groupings of businesses are called “coalitions” and consist of the following outdoor  action sports jeanswear imagewear sportswear and contemporary brands these coalitions are our reportable segments for financial reporting purposes coalition management has responsibility to build their brands with certain financial administrative and systems support and disciplines provided by consolidated functions within vf 

 

we consider our outdoor  action sports sportswear and contemporary brands coalitions to be our lifestyle coalitions with the potential to achieve higher longterm revenue and profit growth than our other businesses our jeanswear and imagewear coalitions are our heritage businesses where our focus is on maintaining our historically strong levels of profitability and cash flows but with lower revenue growth

  jeanswear coalition 

 

our jeanswear coalition markets jeanswear and related casual products in the united states and in many international markets the largest of these brands the lee ® and wrangler ® brands have longstanding traditions as authentic american jeans brands as they were established in 1889 and 1947 respectively and have strong market positions lee ® and wrangler ® products are sold in nearly every developed country products also include shorts casual pants knit and woven tops and outerwear which are designed to complement the jeanswear products and have helped to extend our brands 

 

in domestic markets lee ® products are sold primarily through national chain stores and specialty stores wrangler ® westernwear is marketed through western specialty stores the wrangler hero ®  rustler ® and riders ® brands are marketed to mass merchant and regional discount stores based on available data we believe our key brands have been gaining market share despite significant competitive activity including all of its jeanswear brands we believe that vf has the largest unit market share of jeans in the united states and is one of the largest marketers of jeans in the world we also market cotton casual pants under the lee casuals ®  timber creek by wrangler ® and wrangler ® khakis brands 

 

our vendormanaged inventory and retail floor space management programs with several of our major retailer customers give us a competitive advantage in our domestic jeanswear business we receive pointofsale information from these customers on a daily basis on an individual store and stylesizecolor stockkeeping unit “sku” level we then ship products based on that customer data to ensure their selling floors are appropriately stocked with products that match their shoppers’ needs our systems capabilities allow us to analyze our retail customer’s sales demographic and geographic data to develop product assortment recommendations that maximize the productivity of their jeanswear selling space and minimize their investment in inventory 

 

jeanswear in most international markets is more fashionoriented and has a higher selling price than similar products in the united states the jeans market internationally is also more fragmented than in the united states with competitors ranging from global brands to a number of smaller brands marketed in a specific country or region 

 

vf’s largest international jeanswear business is located in western europe lee ® and wrangler ® jeanswear products are sold through department stores and specialty stores where we employ some of the same retail floor space management programs described above we also market lee ® and wrangler ® products to mass market and specialty stores in canada and mexico as well as to department stores and specialty stores in asia and south america in many international markets we are expanding our reach through vfoperated retail stores which are an important vehicle for presenting our brands’ image and marketing message directly to consumers we are continuing to expand our jeanswear brands in emerging markets such as china and through our majorityowned joint venture in india in foreign markets where vf does not have owned operations lee ® and wrangler ® jeanswear and related products are marketed through distributors agents or licensees lee ® and wrangler ® products are sold in over 500 independently operated mostly monobrand retail stores primarily in eastern europe and asia 

 

in the united states we believe our jeanswear coalition is growing its jeans market share in the mass market and national chain channels of distribution through superior consumer insight and marketing strategies and continuous product innovation in our international businesses growth will be driven by expansion of our existing business in asia where we have averaged in excess of 25 growth per year over the last three years 

 

imagewear coalition 

 

our imagewear coalition consists of the image division occupational apparel and uniforms and the licensed sports division owned and licensed high profile sports and lifestyle apparel each division represents approximately onehalf of coalition revenues 

 

the image division provides uniforms and career occupational apparel for workers in north america and internationally primarily in europe under the red kap ® brand a premium workwear brand with more than 75 years of history the bulwark ® brand flame resistant and protective apparel primarily for the petrochemical utility and mining industries the the force ® brand apparel for law enforcement and public safety personnel and the chef designs tm brand apparel for restaurant and food service staff products include work pants slacks work shirts overalls jackets and smocks image division revenues are significantly affected by the overall level of us industrial and service employment which has been declining for the last two years approximately twothirds 

  of image division sales are to industrial laundries resellers and distributors that in turn supply customized workwear to employers for onthejob wear by production service and whitecollar personnel since industrial laundries and uniform distributors maintain minimal inventories of work clothes vf’s ability to offer rapid delivery of products in a broad range of sizes is an important factor in this market our commitment to customer service supported by an automated central distribution center with several satellite locations enables customer orders to be filled within 24 to 48 hours of receipt and has helped the red kap ® and bulwark ® brands obtain a significant share of uniform apparel sold to laundries resellers and other distributors 

 

the image division also develops and manages uniform programs through customdesigned websites for major business customers eg fedex corporation att air canada continental airlines and american airlines and governmental organizations eg us customs and border protection fire department of new york city transportation security administration national park service and new york city transit authority these websites give employees of these customers the convenience of shopping for their work and career apparel via the internet this division is the nation’s largest supplier of nonmilitary apparel to the us government 

 

in the licensed sports division we design and market sports apparel and fanwear under licenses granted by the major sports leagues individual athletes and related organizations including major league baseball the national football league the national basketball association the national hockey league nascar mlb players association and many major colleges and universities under license from major league baseball majestic ® brand uniforms are worn exclusively onfield by all 30 major league teams majestic ® brand adult and youthsize authentic replica jersey and casual fanwear are sold through sporting goods and athletic specialty stores department stores and major league stadiums adult and youth sports apparel products marketed under other licensed labels are distributed through department mass market sporting goods and athletic specialty stores in addition the licensed sports division is a major supplier of licensed harleydavidson ® apparel marketed to harleydavidson dealerships with the exception of the major league baseball license loss of any license would not have a material effect on the imagewear coalition 

 

the opportunities to grow our imagewear coalition revenues include i extension of its product and service capabilities into new industrial and service apparel markets ii growth of its majestic ® brand for major league baseball and growth of our national football league business through rights for additional apparel categories and new channels of distribution iii market share gains in key licensed categories and iv extension of vf’s floor space management and replenishment capabilities to more retail doors placing productright assortments on the sales floor in each geographic market 

 

sportswear coalition 

 

the nautica ® brand is the principal lifestyle brand of the sportswear coalition nautica ® men’s sportswear noted for its classic styling is marketed through department stores and vfoperated outlet stores in better outlet centers the nautica jeans company ® line features fashionable jeanswear and related tops for younger male consumers we believe the nautica ® brand is the number two men’s sportswear collection brand in department stores this retail channel has undergone significant consolidation in the last few years resulting in numerous store closings which has negatively impacted sales of nautica ® brand products other nautica ® product lines include men’s outerwear underwear and swimwear and men’s and women’s sleepwear nautica ® women’s sportswear is marketed in the united states at most nautica ® outlet stores and at wwwnauticacom 

 

the sportswear coalition operates over 100 nautica ® retail outlet stores in better outlet malls across the united states these stores carry nautica ® merchandise for men women boys girls and infants the product styles sold in the outlet stores are different from the nautica ® styles sold to department and specialty store wholesale customers these outlet stores also carry nautica ® merchandise from licensees to complete their product assortment in addition independent licensees operate over 150 nautica ® brand retail stores across the world 

 

the nautica ® brand is licensed to independent parties in the united states for apparel categories not produced by vf eg tailored clothing dress shirts neckwear women’s swimwear children’s clothing and accessories such as fragrances watches and eyewear and for nonapparel categories eg bed and bath linens and accessories nautica ® products are licensed for sale in over 60 countries outside the united states our licensees’ wholesale sales of nautica ® licensed products total approximately 400 million annually 

  the sportswear coalition also includes the kipling ® business in north america products include kipling ® brand handbags luggage backpacks totes and accessories beginning in 2010 kipling ® handbags and accessories in the department store channel in the united states will be sold exclusively through macy’s department stores in addition all product categories are sold in the united states through specialty luggage and bag stores vfoperated retail stores and wwwkiplingcom and in canada through specialty and department stores about twothirds of products sold in the united states are the same as those sold in europe and other parts of the world with the remainder designed for the us market only 

 

we believe there is potential to improve nautica ® brand revenue and profit performance through more accessible price points store growth in existing nautica ® retail outlet stores growth in our online business and expansion of the licensed business internationally particularly in asia there is also potential for expansion of our kipling ® brand through our handbags and accessories relationship with macy’s inc 

 

contemporary brands coalition 

 

our contemporary brands coalition is focused on premiumpriced lifestyle brands formed in august 2007 the coalition was originally composed of the 7 for all mankind ® and lucy ® brands during 2009 the coalition was expanded to include the john varvatos ® brand previously part of the sportswear coalition which shares many product customer and supply chain characteristics of the other contemporary brands businesses and the splendid ® and ella moss ® brands which were acquired during the year 

 

7 for all mankind ® is a los angelesbased brand of contemporary denim jeans and related products — knit and woven tops sweaters jackets and accessories — for women and men products are noted for their fit and for innovation in design fabric and finish we believe the 7 for all mankind ® brand is the leading premium jeans brand in the united states with the premium segment defined as jeans retailing for 150 or more retail price points for the brand’s core jeans range from 150  199 for basics with higher price points for more fashionforward products in december 2009 advertising age magazine selected the 7 for all mankind ® brand as one of its top ten new products of the decade recognizing the brand for introducing premium denim to the american market and changing the way that consumers shop for jeans with over twothirds of its sales in the united states the brand is marketed through premium department stores such as bloomingdale’s macy’s neiman marcus nordstrom and saks and through specialty stores in addition we opened 13 retail stores in the united states during 2009 bringing the total to 28 stores in the united states internationally sales are through department stores such as harrods and specialty stores plus several vfoperated retail stores we are pursuing growth opportunities in several areas — additional directtoconsumer expansion through companyoperated and partnership retail stores ecommerce additional sportswear product offerings further geographic expansion in europe and asia and licensing 

 

the john varvatos ® brand is a luxury apparel and accessories collection for men including tailored clothing sportswear footwear and accessories the john varvatos  usa ® line of tailored clothing sportswear footwear and accessories is designed to appeal to a younger consumer at somewhat more accessible price points products are sold through upscale department and specialty stores primarily in the united states several vfoperated john varvatos ® retail locations and online at wwwjohnvarvatoscom this business is 80 owned by vf with the balance owned by mr john varvatos 

 

in march 2009 vf completed the acquisition of mo industries holdings inc owner of the splendid ® and ella moss ® brands of women’s premium sportswear these brands are marketed to upscale department and specialty stores primarily in the united states vf had acquired onethird of the outstanding equity of mo industries in june 2008 the first splendid ® retail store was opened in 2009 a limited number of splendid ® and ella moss ® stores are planned for 2010 along with several new shopinshops in major retail accounts 

 

the lucy ® brand of women’s lifestyle apparel is marketed through approximately 60 lucy ® branded retail stores across the united states and via the internet at wwwlucycom lucy ® is an authentic activewear brand designed for versatility comfort and fit that can be worn by today’s active woman from workout to weekend the lucy ® retail stores emphasize the brand’s four core types of activitybased apparel — yoga gym running and outdoor adventure over 90 of the products in the lucy ® retail stores are lucy ® branded with most of the balance being complementary vf brands including a limited selection of the north face ® apparel beginning in 2010 the lucy ® 

  business unit will become part of the outdoor  action sports coalition the lucy ® brand shares attributes of our outdoor brands and will benefit from shared expertise in technical performance fabrics and product innovation 

 

during 2009 premium apparel sales were severely impacted by the recession with many consumers significantly reducing spending for luxury goods which has led to sharply lower same store sales comparisons in the upscale department store channel and the closing of a significant number of specialty shops in 2010 we expect to see our contemporary brands businesses grow their revenues through additional retail and international expansion and product line extensions 

 

directtoconsumer operations 

 

vfoperated retail stores are an integral part of our strategy for growing vf’s brands particularly our lifestyle brands our full price retail stores allow us to showcase a brand’s full line of current season products with fixtures and imagery that support the brand’s positioning these stores provide high visibility for our brands and products and enable us to stay close to the needs and preferences of consumers the proper presentation of products in our retail stores also helps to increase consumer purchases of vf products sold through our wholesale customers vfoperated full price retail stores generally provide operating margins that are equal to or above vf averages and a return on investment above vf averages in addition vf operates outlet stores in both upscale outlet malls and in more traditional valuebased locations these outlet stores serve an important role in our overall inventory management by allowing vf to effectively sell a significant portion of excess discontinued and outofseason products at better prices than are otherwise available from outside parties while maintaining the integrity of our brands 

 

our growing global retail operations include 757 stores at the end of 2009 of that total there are 681 monobrand stores ie primarily one brand’s products offered in each store that sell the north face ®  vans ®  nautica ®  7 for all mankind ®  lucy ®  lee ®  wrangler ® and other products approximately threefourths of these stores offer products at full price with the remainder being outlet locations offering excess discontinued and outofseason products at discounted prices in addition to the monobrand retail and outlet stores we operate 76 vf outlet stores across the united states that sell a broad selection of excess quantities of vfbranded products as well as women’s intimate apparel childrenswear other apparel and accessories approximately threefourths of the vfoperated retail stores are located in the united states the remaining stores are located in europe latin america and asia 

 

across the globe internet sales ie ecommerce comprise a small but growing portion of total retail sales of apparel footwear and accessories ecommerce sales of apparel and footwear have become the second largest category of ecommerce purchases in the united states behind travel purchases at vf ecommerce is a growing portion of our revenues as we currently market the north face ®  vans ®  lee ®  7 for all mankind ®  lucy ®  nautica ®  kipling ® and other brands online in the united states plus the north face ® and other brands across europe additional ecommerce sites will be rolled out for consumers in 2010 

 

total retail store and ecommerce sales accounted for 17 of vf’s consolidated total revenues in 2009 and 16 in 2008 we expect our directtoconsumer business to continue to grow at a faster pace than vf’s overall growth rate as we continue opening retail stores and expanding our ecommerce presence for our lifestyle brands during 2009 we opened 90 retail stores for 2010 capital investments of approximately 60 million are planned for leasehold improvements fixtures and equipment for approximately 8090 new retail locations concentrated where we see higher growth potential — vans ®  the north face ®  7 for all mankind ® and international 

 

in addition to the directtoconsumer venues operated by vf our licensees distributors and other independent parties operate over 1300 primarily monobrand retail stores dedicated to our brands these stores — located primarily in eastern europe and asia and focused on the north face ®  kipling ®  nautica ®  lee ® and wrangler ® brands — have the appearance of vfoperated retail stores 

 

licensing arrangements 

 

as part of our business strategy of expanding market penetration of vfowned brands we enter into licensing agreements for our brands for specific apparel and complementary product categories in identified geographic 

  regions if such arrangements with independent parties can provide more effective manufacturing distribution and marketing of such products than could be achieved internally these licensing arrangements relate to a broad range of vf brands and are for fixed terms of generally five years with conditional renewal options each licensee pays royalties to vf based on its sales of licensed products with most agreements providing for a minimum royalty requirement royalties generally range from 5 to 7 of the licensing partners’ net sales of licensed products gross royalty income was 772 million in 2009 with the largest contribution from the nautica ® brand 

 

in addition licensees of our brands are generally required to spend a specified amount to advertise vf’s products ranging from 1 to 5 of their net licensed product sales in some cases these advertising amounts are remitted to vf for advertising on behalf of the licensees we provide support to these business partners and ensure the integrity of our brand names by taking an active role in the design quality control advertising marketing and distribution of licensed products 

 

vf has also entered into license agreements to use trademarks owned by third parties we market apparel under licenses granted by major league baseball the national football league the national basketball association the national hockey league harleydavidson motor company inc nascar major colleges and individual athletes and related organizations most of which contain minimum annual licensing and advertising requirements 

 

manufacturing sourcing and distribution 

 

product design fit fabric finish and quality are important in all of our businesses these functions are performed by employees located in either our global supply chain organization or our branded business units across the globe 

 

vf’s centralized global supply chain organization sources product and ultimately bears the responsibility to deliver product to our customers vf is highly skilled in managing the complexity associated with the supply chain vf’s revenues are comprised of over 400 million units representing 500000 skus spread over 30 brands vf operates over 30 manufacturing facilities and utilizes over 1600 contractor manufacturing facilities we operate over 30 distribution centers and over 700 retail stores managing this complexity is made possible by our use of information systems technologies — with bestofbreed systems for product development forecasting order management warehouse management etc attached to our core enterprise resource management platform 

 

today 16 of our products sold are manufactured in vfowned facilities and 84 are products obtained from contractors primarily in asia a combination of vfowned and contracted production from different geographic regions provides flexibility and a competitive advantage in our product sourcing we will continue to manage our supply chain from a global perspective and adjust as needed to changes in the global production environment 

 

we operate manufacturing facilities primarily cutting sewing and finishing located in mexico central america poland and the middle east a significant percentage of our denim bottoms and occupational apparel are manufactured in these plants for these owned production facilities we purchase raw materials from numerous domestic and international suppliers to meet scheduled production needs raw materials include fabrics made from cotton synthetics and blends of cotton and synthetic yarn as well as thread and trim product identification buttons zippers and snaps in some instances we contract the sewing of vfowned raw materials into finished product with independent contractors in the united states mexico and central america manufacturing in the united states is primarily limited to screen printing and embroidery of jerseys tshirts and fleece products including major league baseball uniforms and other products while we obtain fixed price commitments for denim and certain supplies for up to one year in advance specific purchase obligations with suppliers are typically limited to the succeeding two to six months our only longterm contract is a commitment in connection with the sale of our childrenswear business in 2004 to purchase a remaining total of 675 million of childrenswear for sale through our vf outlet stores with a minimum of 150 million per year no single supplier represents more than 3 of our total cost of sales 

 

for the us market our current sourcing strategy includes a balance of vfowned production and contracted production in the western hemisphere and contracted production from asia products manufactured in vf facilities generally have a lower cost and shorter lead times than contracted production product obtained from contractors in the western hemisphere generally has a higher cost than product obtained from contractors in the far east but gives 

  us greater flexibility and shorter lead times and allows for lower inventory levels the vast majority of units sold and dollar value of domestic net sales in 2009 were manufactured by outside contractors primarily in asia this combination of vfowned and contracted production along with different geographic regions and cost structures provides a balanced approach to product sourcing 

 

our independent contractors generally own the raw materials and ship to vf only finished readyforsale products these contractors are engaged through vf sourcing hubs in hong kong with several satellite offices across asia and miami these hubs are responsible for product procurement product quality assurance supplier management transportation and shipping functions in the eastern and western hemispheres respectively substantially all products in the outdoor  action sports and sportswear coalitions as well as a growing portion of product requirements for our jeanswear and imagewear coalitions are obtained through these sourcing hubs for most products in our contemporary brands coalition we contract the majority of sewing and finishing of vfowned raw materials through a network of independent domestic and international contractors 

 

management continually monitors political risks and developments related to duties tariffs and quotas we limit vf’s sourcing exposure through among other measures i extensive geographic diversification with a mix of vfoperated and contracted production ii shifts of production among countries and contractors iii allocation of production to merchandise categories where the free flow of product is available and iv sourcing from countries with tariff preference and free trade agreements vf does not directly or indirectly source products from suppliers in countries that are identified by the state department as state sponsors of terrorism and are subject to us economic sanctions and export controls 

 

all vfowned production facilities throughout the world as well as all independent contractor facilities that manufacture vfbranded products must comply with vf’s global compliance principles these principles established in 1997 and consistent with international labor standards are a set of strict standards covering legal and ethical business practices workers’ ages work hours health and safety conditions environment sustainability or standards compliance with local laws and reputations in addition our owned factories must also undergo certification by the independent nonprofit organization worldwide responsible accredited production “wrap” that promotes global ethics in manufacturing vf through its contractor monitoring program audits the activities of the many independent businesses and contractors that produce vfbranded goods at locations across the globe each of the over 1600 independent contractor facilities including those serving our independent licensees must be precertified prior to performance of any production on behalf of vf this precertification includes passing a factory inspection and signing a vf terms of engagement agreement we maintain an ongoing audit program to ensure compliance with these requirements by using dedicated internal and outsourced staff additional information about vf’s code of business conduct global compliance principles terms of engagement factory compliance guidelines factory audit procedure and environmental compliance guidelines along with a global compliance report is available on the vf website at wwwvfccom 

 

vf did not experience difficulty in filling its raw material and contracting production needs during 2009 and we do not anticipate difficulties in meeting our raw materials and contracting production requirements during 2010 the loss of any one supplier or contractor would not have a significant adverse effect on our business 

 

product is shipped from our independent suppliers and vfoperated manufacturing plants to many distribution centers in the united states and international markets in limited instances product is shipped directly to our customers product is inspected sorted and stored in our distribution centers until needed for packing and shipping to our wholesale customers or our retail stores most distribution centers are operated by vf and some support multiple brands our distribution centers use computercontrolled inventory management technology for efficient tracking and movement of products a small portion of our distribution needs are met by contract distribution centers 

 

seasonality 

 

with its diversified product offerings vf’s operating results are somewhat seasonal on a quarterly basis and excluding the effect of acquisitions consolidated total revenues for 2009 ranged from a low of approximately 21 of full year revenues in the second quarter to a high of 29 in the third quarter this variation results primarily from the seasonal influences on revenues of our outdoor  action sports coalition where 19 of the coalition revenues 

  occurred in the second quarter and 33 in the third quarter of 2009 with changes in our mix of business and growth of our retail operations historical quarterly revenue and profit trends may not be indicative of future trends we expect the portion of annual revenues and profits occurring in the second half of the year to increase 

 

working capital requirements vary throughout the year working capital increases during the first half of the year as inventory builds to support peak shipping periods and then decreases during the second half of the year as those inventories are sold and accounts receivable are collected cash provided by operating activities is substantially higher in the second half of the year due to higher net income during that period and reduced working capital requirements particularly during the fourth quarter 

 

advertising and customer support 

 

during 2009 our advertising and promotion spending was 3291 million representing 46 of net sales we advertise in consumer and trade publications on national and local radio and television and on the internet we also participate in cooperative advertising on a shared cost basis with major retailers in print media radio and television we sponsor various sporting music and other special events and sponsor a number of athletes and other personalities we employ marketing sciences to optimize the impact of advertising and promotional spending and to identify the types of spending that provide the greatest return on our marketing investments 

 

we provide pointofsale fixtures and signage to our wholesale customers to enhance the presentation and brand image of our products this includes shopinshops which are separate retail sales areas with brand signage — a “store within a store” — dedicated to a specific vf brand within a customers’ location we participate in concession arrangements with department store customers in china and some other international markets in a typical concession a department store provides a dedicated sales area along with checkout credit and other services while vf bears the risk of inventory ownership concession sales associates may be employees of vf or the department store 

 

we participate in various retail customer incentive programs incentive programs with retailers include discounts allowances and cooperative advertising funds we also offer sales incentive programs directly to consumers in the form of rebate and coupon offers sales incentive offers with retailers and with consumers are recognized as sales discounts in arriving at reported net sales except that cooperative advertising reimbursements of documented retailer advertising costs are reported as advertising expense and free product with purchase offers are reported in cost of goods sold 

 

internet websites are maintained for most of our brands many of them are businesstoconsumer ecommerce sites where consumers can order products from vf other consumer websites provide information about our brands and products and may direct consumers to our wholesale customers where they can purchase our products we also operate several businesstobusiness sites where our retail customers can order vf products 

 

our outdoor  action sports jeanswear sportswear and contemporary brands coalitions employ a staff of instore marketing and merchandising coordinators located in major cities across the united states these individuals visit our customers’ retail locations to ensure that our products and those of our licensees are properly presented on the merchandise sales floor and to inform the customers’ sales force about our products and related promotions

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating vf’s business and the forwardlooking statements contained in this form 10k any of the following risks could materially adversely affect vf’s business its operating results and its financial condition 

 

vf’s revenues and profits depend on the level of consumer spending for apparel which is sensitive to general economic conditions 

 

the apparel industry has historically been subject to cyclical variations and is particularly affected by adverse trends in the general economy the success of vf’s business depends on consumer spending consumer spending is influenced by a number of factors including actual and perceived economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as unemployment and wages business conditions interest rates availability of credit housing costs the level of securities markets energy prices and tax rates in the international national regional and local markets where vf’s products are sold consumer spending was constrained during 2009 and a further decline in general economic conditions could further reduce the level of consumer spending 

 

we do not expect a significant improvement in business conditions and consumer spending in the near future the effects of a return to recessionary conditions could have a material adverse effect on vf 

 

the global recession — with rising unemployment reduced availability of credit increased savings rates and declines in real estate and securities values — had a negative impact on retail sales of apparel and other consumer products reduced sales by our wholesale customers may lead to lower retail inventory levels reduced orders to suppliers like vf or order cancellations reduced sales by some of our wholesale customers along with the possibility of their reduced access to or inability to access the credit markets may result in various retailers experiencing significant financial difficulties financial difficulties of customers could result in reduced sales to those customers or could result in store closures bankruptcies or liquidations higher credit risk relating to receivables from customers experiencing financial difficulty may result if these developments occur our inability 

  to shift sales to other customers or to collect on vf’s trade accounts receivable could have a material adverse effect on vf’s financial condition and results of operations 

 

a growing portion of our revenues are directtoconsumer through vfoperated retail stores and ecommerce websites it is possible that reduced consumer confidence along with a reduction in availability of consumer credit and increasing unemployment could lead to reduced purchases of vf’s products through vfoperated retail stores and websites this could have a material adverse effect on vf’s financial condition and results of operations 

 

the apparel industry is highly competitive and vf’s success depends on its ability to respond to constantly changing fashion trends and consumer demand reduced sales or prices resulting from competition could have a material adverse effect on vf 

 

vf competes with numerous brands and manufacturers of apparel some of our competitors may be larger and have more resources than vf in certain product categories in addition vf competes directly with the private label brands of its wholesale customers vf’s ability to compete within the apparel and footwear industries depends on its ability to 

 

  

failure to compete effectively or to keep pace with rapidly changing markets and trends could have a material adverse effect on vf’s business financial condition and results of operations in addition if we misjudge fashion trends and market conditions we could be faced with significant excess inventories for some products that we may have to sell at a loss or missed opportunities that may result in lost sales 

 

vf’s results of operations could be materially harmed if vf is unable to accurately forecast demand for its products 

 

we often schedule internal production and place orders for products with independent manufacturers before our customers’ orders are firm therefore if we fail to accurately forecast customer demand we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of product to deliver to our customers factors that could affect our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products include 

 

  

inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory writedowns and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices which could have an adverse effect on vf’s results of operations and financial condition on the other hand if we underestimate demand for our products our manufacturing facilities or third 

  party manufacturers may not be able to produce products to meet customer requirements and this could result in delays in the shipment of products and lost revenues as well as damage to vf’s reputation and customer relationships there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully manage inventory levels to exactly meet future order and reorder requirements 

 

a substantial portion of vf’s revenues and gross profit is derived from a small number of large customers the loss of any of these customers could substantially reduce vf’s profits 

 

a few of vf’s customers account for a significant portion of revenues sales to vf’s ten largest customers were 27 of total revenues in fiscal 2009 with walmart stores inc accounting for 11 of revenues sales are generally on a purchase order basis and we do not have longterm agreements with any of our customers a decision by any of vf’s major customers to decrease significantly the number of products purchased from vf could substantially reduce revenues and have a material adverse effect on vf’s financial condition and results of operations moreover in recent years the retail industry has experienced consolidation and other ownership changes in the future retailers may further consolidate undergo restructurings or reorganizations realign their affiliations or reposition their stores’ target market these developments could result in a reduction in the number of stores that carry vf’s products increased ownership concentration within the retail industry increased credit exposure or increased retailer leverage over their suppliers these changes could impact vf’s opportunities in the market and increase vf’s reliance on a smaller number of large customers 

 

vf’s profitability may decline as a result of increasing pressure on margins 

 

the apparel industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors including intense competition consolidation in the retail industry pressure from retailers to reduce the costs of products and changes in consumer demand these factors may cause us to reduce our sales prices to retailers and consumers which could cause vf’s gross margin to decline if we are unable to offset price reductions with comparable reductions in operating costs if vf’s sales prices decline and we fail to sufficiently reduce our product costs or operating expenses vf’s profitability will decline this could have a material adverse effect on vf’s results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

 

fluctuations in the price availability and quality of raw materials and finished goods could increase costs and cause service delays 

 

fluctuations in the price availability and quality of fabrics or other raw materials used by vf in its manufactured apparel or of purchased finished goods could have a material adverse effect on vf’s cost of sales or its ability to meet its customers’ demands the prices for such fabrics depend on demand and market prices for the raw materials used to produce them particularly cotton the price and availability of such raw materials may fluctuate significantly depending on many factors including crop yields and weather patterns in the future vf may not be able to pass higher costs on to its customers 

 

vf may not succeed in implementing its growth strategy 

 

one of our key strategic objectives is growth we seek to grow through both organic growth and acquisitions by building new growing lifestyle brands expanding our share with winning customers stretching vf’s brands and customers to new geographies leveraging our supply chain and information technology capabilities across vf expanding our directtoconsumer business and identifying and developing high potential employees we may not be able to grow our existing businesses or achieve planned cost savings we may have difficulty identifying acquisition targets and we may not be able to successfully integrate a newly acquired business or achieve expected cost savings or synergies from such integration we may not be able to expand our market share with winning customers expand our brands geographically or achieve the expected results from our supply chain initiatives we may also have difficulty recruiting or developing qualified managers failure to implement our growth strategy may have a material adverse effect on vf’s business 

  vf’s operations in international markets and earnings in those markets may be affected by legal regulatory political and economic risks 

 

our ability to maintain the current level of operations in our existing international markets and to capitalize on growth in existing and new international markets is subject to risks associated with international operations these include the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws and regulations unexpected changes in regulatory requirements new tariffs or other barriers to some international markets 

 

we cannot predict whether quotas duties taxes exchange controls or other restrictions will be imposed by the united states the european union or other countries upon the import or export of our products in the future or what effect any of these actions would have on vf’s business financial condition or results of operations we cannot predict whether there might be changes in our ability to repatriate earnings or capital from international jurisdictions changes in regulatory geopolitical policies and other factors may adversely affect vf’s business or may require us to modify our current business practices 

 

approximately onethird of vf’s income is earned in international jurisdictions vf is exposed to risks of changes in us policy for companies having business operations outside the united states in recent months the president and others in his administration have proposed changes in us income tax laws that could among other things accelerate the us taxability of nonus earnings or limit foreign tax credits although such proposals have been deferred if new legislation were enacted it is possible our us income tax expense could increase which would reduce our earnings 

 

vf uses foreign suppliers and manufacturing facilities for a substantial portion of its raw materials and finished products which poses risks to vf’s business operations 

 

during fiscal 2009 approximately 84 of vf’s products sold were produced by and purchased from independent manufacturers primarily located in asia with substantially all of the remainder produced by vfowned and operated manufacturing facilities located in mexico central america poland and the middle east although no single supplier and no one country is critical to vf’s production needs any of the following could materially and adversely affect our ability to produce or deliver vf products and as a result have a material adverse effect on vf’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

 17 

   

our business is subject to national state and local laws and regulations for environmental employment safety and other matters the costs of compliance with or the violation of such laws and regulations by vf or by independent suppliers who manufacture products for vf could have an adverse effect on our operations and cash flows 

 

numerous governmental agencies enforce comprehensive federal state and local laws and regulations on a wide range of environmental employment safety and other matters vf could be adversely affected by costs of compliance or violations of those laws and regulations in addition the costs of products purchased by vf from independent contractors could increase due to the costs of compliance by those contractors further violations of such laws and regulations could affect the availability of inventory thereby affecting our net sales 

 

if vf’s suppliers fail to use acceptable ethical business practices vf’s business could suffer 

 

we require third party suppliers to operate in compliance with applicable laws rules and regulations regarding working conditions employment practices and environmental compliance additionally we require all suppliers making vfbranded apparel whether directly for vf or for its licensees to comply with vf’s terms of engagement and global compliance principles our staff and third parties retained for such purposes periodically visit and audit the operations of vf’s owned and operated facilities and those of independent contractors manufacturing product for vf to determine compliance however we do not control independent manufacturers or their labor and other business practices if one of our independent contractors violates labor or other laws or implements labor or other business practices that are generally regarded as unethical in the united states the shipment of finished products to vf could be interrupted orders could be cancelled relationships could be terminated and vf’s reputation could be damaged any of these events could have a material adverse effect on vf’s revenues and consequently its results of operations 

 

vf’s business is exposed to the risks of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations vf’s hedging strategies may not be effective in mitigating those risks 

 

approximately 30 of vf’s total revenues is derived from international markets vf’s foreign businesses operate in functional currencies other than the us dollar changes in currency exchange rates may affect the us dollar value of the foreign currencydenominated amounts at which vf’s international businesses purchase products incur costs or sell products in addition for vf’s usbased businesses the majority of products are sourced from independent contractors or vf plants located in foreign countries as a result the cost of these products may be affected by changes in the value of the relevant currencies furthermore much of vf’s licensing revenue is derived from sales in foreign currencies changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse impact on vf’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

in accordance with our operating practices we hedge a significant portion of our foreign currency transaction exposures arising in the ordinary course of business to reduce risks in our cash flows and earnings our hedging strategy may not be effective in reducing these risks and no hedging strategy can completely insulate vf from foreign exchange risk we do not hedge foreign currency translation rate changes 

 

further our use of derivative financial instruments may expose vf to counterparty risks although vf only enters into hedging contracts with counterparties having investment grade credit ratings it is possible that the credit quality of a counterparty could be downgraded or a counterparty could default on its obligations which could have a material adverse impact on vf’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

vf borrows funds on a shortterm basis primarily to support seasonal working capital requirements longterm debt is part of vf’s total capital structure vf may have difficulty accessing capital markets for short or longterm financing 

 

during the last two years the global capital and credit markets have experienced extreme levels of volatility and disruption with government intervention mergers or bankruptcies of several major financial institutions and a general decline in global liquidity many corporate issuers have been unable to access credit markets 

  although vf had over 700 million of cash and equivalents at the end of 2009 we typically use shortterm commercial paper borrowings to support seasonal working capital requirements with amounts generally repaid by the end of each year from strong cash flows from operations vf was able to continue to borrow in the commercial paper markets during the last two years and all commercial paper borrowings were repaid by the end of each year in addition vf may access the longterm capital markets to replace maturing debt obligations or to fund acquisition or other growth opportunities there is no assurance that the commercial paper markets or the longterm capital markets will continue to be reliable sources of financing for vf 

 

vf has committed domestic and international bank credit facilities one or more of the participating banks may not be able to honor their commitments which could have an adverse effect on vf’s business 

 

if we were to have difficulty in accessing the short or longterm capital markets vf has 13 billion of committed domestic and international bank credit facilities that expire in october 2012 continued distress in the financial markets could however impair the ability of one or more of the banks participating in our credit agreements from honoring their commitments this could have an adverse effect on our business if we were not able to replace those commitments or to locate other sources of liquidity on acceptable terms 

 

the loss of members of vf’s executive management and other key employees could have a material adverse effect on its business 

 

vf depends on the services and management experience of its executive officers and business leaders who have substantial experience and expertise in vf’s business vf also depends on other key employees involved in the operation of its business competition for qualified personnel in the apparel industry is intense the unexpected loss of services of one or more of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on vf 

 

vf may be unable to protect its trademarks and other intellectual property rights 

 

vf’s trademarks and other intellectual property rights are important to its success and its competitive position vf is susceptible to others imitating its products and infringing its intellectual property rights with the shift in product mix to higher priced brands in recent years vf is more susceptible to infringement of its intellectual property rights some of vf’s brands such as the north face ®  vans ®  jansport ®  nautica ®  wrangler ® and lee ® brands enjoy significant worldwide consumer recognition and the generally higher pricing of such products creates additional risk of counterfeiting and infringement 

 

counterfeiting of vf’s products or infringement on its intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our brands or otherwise adversely affect vf revenues actions we have taken to establish and protect vf’s intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of its products by others or to prevent others from seeking to invalidate its trademarks or block sales of vf’s products as a violation of the trademarks and intellectual property rights of others in addition unilateral actions in the united states or other countries such as changes to or the repeal of laws recognizing trademark or other intellectual property rights could have an impact on vf’s ability to enforce those rights 

 

the value of vf’s intellectual property could diminish if others assert rights in or ownership of trademarks and other intellectual property rights of vf or trademarks that are similar to vf’s trademarks or trademarks that vf licenses from others we may be unable to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction in some cases there may be trademark owners who have prior rights to vf’s trademarks because the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states in other cases there may be holders who have prior rights to similar trademarks vf is from time to time involved in opposition and cancellation proceedings with respect to some of its intellectual property rights 

 

vf is subject to the risk that its licensees may not maintain the value of vf’s brands 

 

during 2009 772 million of vf’s revenues were derived from licensing royalties although vf generally has significant control over its licensees’ products and advertising we rely on our licensees for among other things operational and financial controls over their businesses failure of our licensees to successfully market licensed products or our inability to replace existing licensees if necessary could adversely affect vf’s revenues both 

  directly from reduced royalties received and indirectly from reduced sales of our other products risks are also associated with a licensee’s ability to 

 

  

in addition vf relies on its licensees to help preserve the value of its brands although we make every attempt to protect vf’s brands through among other things approval rights over design production processes and quality packaging merchandising distribution advertising and promotion of our licensed products we cannot completely control the use of licensed vf brands by our licensees the misuse of a brand by a licensee could have a material adverse effect on that brand and on vf 

 

vf has entered into license agreements to use the trademarks of others loss of a license could have an adverse effect on vf’s operating results 

 

vf has entered into agreements to market products under licenses granted by third parties including major league baseball the national football league and harleydavidson motor company inc some of these licenses are for a short term and do not contain renewal options loss of a license which in certain cases could result in an impairment charge for related operating and intangible assets could have an adverse effect on vf’s operating results 

 

vf relies significantly on information technology any inadequacy interruption integration failure or security failure of that technology could harm vf’s ability to effectively operate its business 

 

our ability to effectively manage and operate our business depends significantly on information technology systems the failure of these systems to operate effectively problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems difficulty in integrating new systems or systems of acquired businesses or a breach in security of these systems could adversely impact the operations of vf’s business moreover vf and its customers could suffer harm if customer information were accessed by third parties due to a security failure in vf’s systems it could also require significant expenditures to remediate any such failure problem or breach 

 

if vf encounters problems with its distribution system vf’s ability to deliver its products to the market could be adversely affected 

 

vf relies on its distribution facilities to warehouse and using its own employees or in some cases independent contractors to ship product to its customers vf’s distribution system includes computercontrolled and automated equipment which means its operations are complicated and may be subject to a number of risks related to security or computer viruses the proper operation of software and hardware power interruptions or other system failures because substantially all of vf’s products are distributed from a relatively small number of locations vf’s operations could also be interrupted by earthquakes floods fires or other natural disasters near its distribution centers we maintain business interruption insurance but it may not adequately protect vf from the adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in vf’s distribution facilities such as the longterm loss of customers or an erosion of brand image in addition vf’s distribution capacity is dependent on the timely performance of services by third parties including the transportation of product to and from its distribution facilities if we encounter problems with our distribution system our ability to meet customer expectations manage inventory complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies could be materially adversely affected 

  vf’s balance sheet includes a significant amount of intangible assets and goodwill a decline in the estimated fair value of an intangible asset or of a business unit could result in an asset impairment charge which would be recorded as an operating expense in vf’s consolidated statement of income and could be material 

 

under current accounting standards we estimate the fair value of acquired assets including intangible assets and assumed liabilities arising from a business acquisition the excess if any of the cost of the acquired business over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired is goodwill the goodwill is then assigned to a business unit or “reporting unit” within vf which depends on how the acquired business will be operated after integration into vf 

 

we evaluate trademark intangible assets that are not amortized and goodwill for possible impairment at least annually in addition intangible assets that are being amortized are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value might not be recoverable for these impairment tests we use various valuation methodologies to estimate the fair value of our business units and intangible assets if the fair value of an asset is less than its carrying value we would recognize an impairment charge for the difference during 2009 we recognized goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges totaling 1220 million 

 

at december 2009 vf had approximately 10 billion of indefinitelived trademark intangible assets and 14 billion of goodwill on its balance sheet these assets are not required to be amortized under current accounting rules in addition vf had approximately 05 billion of intangible assets that are being amortized under current accounting rules goodwill and intangible assets combined represent 45 of vf’s total assets and 76 of stockholders’ equity 

 

it is possible that we could have an impairment charge for goodwill or trademark intangible assets in future periods if i overall economic conditions in 2010 or future years vary from our current assumptions ii business conditions or our strategies for a specific business unit change from our current assumptions iii investors require higher rates of return on equity investments in the marketplace or iv enterprise values of comparable publicly traded companies or of actual sales transactions of comparable companies were to decline resulting in lower comparable multiples of revenues and ebitda and accordingly lower implied values of goodwill and intangible assets specifically regarding our contemporary brands coalition the recession of the last two years has particularly impacted the upper tier or premium department and specialty store channel of distribution and in many cases products sold through this premium channel while no impairment is indicated for any of our business units within this coalition if the premium channel does not improve from recessionary levels or if the growth strategies of our business units are not successful it is possible that an impairment charge would be required a future impairment charge for goodwill or intangible assets could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

 

vf’s defined benefit pension plans were underfunded at the end of 2009 due primarily to the decline in market value of the plans’ investment portfolios resulting from the global financial and credit crisis that began near the end of 2007 this resulted in recognition of a significant liability representing the underfunded status of our plans and a significant charge to stockholders’ equity in our consolidated balance sheets at the end of 2008 and 2009 as well as a significant increase in our 2009 pension expense if the pension plans’ investments were to decline in value or if the level of interest rates were to decline from the current level the pension plans could be further underfunded resulting in recognition of additional underfunded liabilities and additional charges to stockholders’ equity in our consolidated balance sheets higher pension expense and possibly additional cash contributions to fund the plans 

 

vf’s defined benefit pension plans were underfunded at the end of 2009 resulting in recognition of 2388 million of pension liabilities at the end of 2009 differences between actual results and amounts estimated using actuarial assumptions eg investment returns discount rate mortality are deferred and amortized in future years’ pension cost deferred actuarial losses included in stockholders’ equity totaled 2660 million primarily because of these deferred actuarial losses our pension cost increased from 108 million in 2008 to 980 million in 2009 to improve the funded status of our pension plans we made over 200 million of discretionary contributions to our plans during 2009 

  a further decrease in the value of our plans’ assets or a decrease in the discount rate used to value the plans’ liabilities to participants could result in a further decrease in the plans’ funded status in that case vf would recognize additional pension liabilities and additional charges to stockholders’ equity in our consolidated balance sheet and higher pension expense in future years further vf could be required to make additional cash funding contributions to return the pension plans to a fully funded status over the next few years

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend  

overview 

 

vf corporation is a leading global marketer of branded lifestyle and other apparel products management’s vision is to grow vf by building leading lifestyle brands that excite consumers around the world lifestyle brands representative of the activities that consumers aspire to generally extend across multiple geographic markets and product categories and therefore have greater opportunities for growth 

 

vf owns a diverse portfolio of brands with strong market positions in several consumer product categories in addition we market occupational apparel to resellers and major corporate and government customers vf has a broad customer base with products distributed through leading specialty stores upscale and traditional department stores national chains and mass merchants plus vfoperated retail stores and internet websites 

 

vf’s businesses are grouped into five product categories and by brands within those product categories for management and internal financial reporting purposes these groupings of businesses are referred to as “coalitions” both management and vf’s board of directors evaluate operating performance at the coalition level which is consistent with that used for management incentive compensation these coalitions represent vf’s reportable segments these groupings of businesses are summarized as follows 

 

 

 

impact of the current global economic environment 

 

the global recession that began near the end of 2007 is the longest and most severe recession in the last several decades this recession which has resulted in flattofalling consumer income levels sharp declines in real estate and global securities markets volatility in commodity and currency markets significant increases in unemployment numerous retailer and other bankruptcies and unprecedented government stimulus programs has led to a decline in consumer spending that has impacted vf as well as most other companies recent statistics indicate that the us and global economies are showing some signs of stability but unemployment is still very high and consumer spending remains weak 

  consumer spending represents about 70 of the domestic economy and spending at retail represents about onehalf of that the general reduction in household wealth and income over the last two years along with reduced availability of consumer credit and increased savings and debt repayment rates has reduced consumer purchases of discretionary items such as apparel reduced consumer spending has had a significant impact on sales in all retail channels and particularly in sales of premium higher priced products in the upper tier distribution channels although there are some signs of stabilization consumer confidence remains weak we believe economic conditions will remain difficult and that consumer spending will remain constrained in global markets through 2010 

 

in response to these market conditions vf was aggressive in reducing costs and lowering inventory levels during 2009 however we have continued to invest in our brands and in 2010 are expecting to increase our investments in advertising product development and retail store expansion these investments totaling 50 million will be very targeted and concentrated in those businesses with the strongest opportunities for growth including the north face ®  vans ® and 7 for all mankind ® brands and our business in asia a portion of these investments will be targeted at further strengthening our product innovation and sustainability platforms we believe that the strength of our brands is fundamental to our success in this economic climate 

 

longterm financial targets 

 

while our longterm revenue and earnings growth targets as described below were not achieved in 2009 due to global recessionary conditions and are not expected to be achieved in 2010 our longterm targets remain intact these targets are summarized below

excluding the effect of the impairment charge discussed in the “analysis of results of continuing operations” section below we earned a 126 return on invested capital in 2009 compared with a 135 return in 2008 our returns in these years were negatively impacted by the global economic conditions discussed above our 2008 cost reduction initiatives our incremental pension expense in 2009 and by our 2007 acquisitions newly acquired businesses generally have a lower than average return on invested capital in their earlier years of ownership we expect our return on invested capital to improve in 2010 and move closer to the longterm target of 17

total revenues consist of net sales of products and royalty income from licensees revenues declined 6 in 2009 with 2 of the decline due to foreign currency translation the effect of global recessionary conditions on consumer spending affected all of our businesses in 2009 in spite of the recession we reported growth in our outdoor  action sports businesses in 2009 revenues increased in 2008 due to overall unit volume increases and organic growth in our outdoor  action sports businesses and the benefit of a full year of operations of our contemporary brands businesses acquired in 2007 additional details on revenues are provided in the section titled “information by business segment” 

 

in translating foreign currencies into the us dollar the stronger us dollar in relation to the functional currencies where vf conducts the majority of its business primarily the european euro countries negatively impacted revenue by 156 million in 2009 relative to 2008 a weaker us dollar benefited revenues by 109 million in 2008 relative to 2007 the weighted average translation rate for the euro was 139 per euro during 2009 compared with 147 during 2008 and 136 during 2007 

  the following table presents the percentage relationship to total revenues for components of our consolidated statements of income 

 

 

 

gross margins increased 14 in 2009 over 2008 and 10 in 2008 over 2007 from the impact of our directtoconsumer operations which have gross margin percentages higher than vf averages in addition our aggressive management of inventory levels in 2009 resulted in gross margin improvement due to a lower impact from the disposal of excess and obsolete inventory the increase in 2009 was partially offset by lower gross margins in our european jeanswear and imagewear businesses the 2008 increase was partially offset by lower gross margins primarily in our european jeanswear business see the “information by business segment” section below 

 

marketing administrative and general expenses as a percent of revenues increased 12 in 2009 over 2008 due to the higher expense of our defined benefit pension plans and 11 due to growth in our directtoconsumer business which has a higher expense ratio than our wholesale business the 2009 comparison benefited from i the absence of nonrecurring charges from cost reduction actions which increased marketing administrative and general expenses as a percent of revenues by 07 in 2008 and ii the benefit of these actions and other spending reductions in 2009 

 

marketing administrative and general expenses as a percent of revenues increased 14 in 2008 over 2007 due to the growth in our directtoconsumer business and 07 due to nonrecurring charges from the cost reduction actions mentioned above these increases were partially offset by lower incentive compensation and other spending reductions in 2008 

 

we include costs of cooperative advertising licensing retail stores and shipping and handling in marketing administrative and general expenses as stated in our significant accounting policies in note a to the consolidated financial statements some apparel companies classify cooperative advertising costs as a reduction of net sales and licensing costs as a reduction to royalty income further some classify retail store costs and shipping and handling costs in cost of goods sold accordingly our gross margin and operating expenses may not be directly comparable with other apparel companies 

 

we completed our annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinitelived trademark intangible assets in the fourth quarter of 2009 based on our assessment of current and expected future economic conditions trends and forecasted cash flows at each business unit and assumptions representative of those that market participants would make in valuing our business units vf management determined that the carrying values of goodwill at its reef ®  nautica ®  and lucy ® business units exceeded their fair values and the carrying values of trademark intangible assets at its reef ® and lucy ® business units exceeded their fair values accordingly vf recorded noncash impairment charges totaling 1220 million 1144 million net of related income tax benefits to reduce the carrying values of goodwill and trademark intangible assets of these business units to their fair values of this total reef ® represented 367 million nautica ® represented 585 million and lucy ® represented 268 million in each case 23 14 and 26 of its combined goodwill and nonamortized trademark intangible assets for additional information see notes h and u to the consolidated financial statements and the “critical accounting policies and estimates” section below references to financial results excluding the impact of the impairment charge reflect nongaap measures and are addressed below in the “nongaap financial information” section 

 

interest income decreased 39 million in 2009 and 32 million in 2008 primarily due to lower interest rates interest expense including bank fees and amortization of deferred costs and a hedging gain decreased 81 million in 2009 due to reduced shortterm borrowing levels and lower interest rates interest expense increased 219 million in 2008 due to an increase in debt related to the issuance of 6000 million of senior longterm notes in october 2007 to fund our 2007 acquisitions this increase was partially offset by lower shortterm borrowing rates average interestbearing debt outstanding totaled approximately 1364 million for 2009 1454 million for 2008 and 

  1080 million for 2007 the weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt was 61 for 2009 63 for 2008 and 64 for 2007 

 

the effective income tax rate was 299 in 2009 and 262 excluding the impairment charge discussed above these rates compared with 289 in 2008 and 323 in 2007 during 2009 we recorded tax benefits of 175 million related to favorable outcomes of us state tax audits and from expirations of statutes of limitations in several us state and international jurisdictions where accruals for uncertain tax positions had been recorded these items lowered our 2009 annual tax rate by 27 during 2008 we recorded tax benefits of 246 million related primarily to favorable outcomes of foreign tax audits expirations of statutes of limitations in foreign jurisdictions and other state tax benefits that lowered our 2008 annual tax rate by 29 in addition during 2008 we recorded tax benefits of 115 million to reflect updated assessments of previously accrued amounts which lowered our 2008 annual tax rate by 14 during 2007 we recorded tax benefits of 120 million related primarily to expirations of statutes of limitations in several international jurisdictions that lowered our 2007 annual tax rate by 13 the remaining declines in the effective income tax rate in 2009 excluding the impairment charge from 2008 and in 2008 from 2007 were primarily attributed to growth in our international businesses in jurisdictions having effective tax rates that are substantially lower than the united states 

 

net income attributable to vf corporation decreased to 4613 million in 2009 from 6027 million in 2008 while earnings per share decreased to 413 in 2009 from 542 in 2008 all per share amounts are presented on a diluted basis earnings per share in 2009 were 516 excluding a 103 impairment charge for goodwill and intangible assets earnings per share in 2009 were also negatively impacted by i incremental pension expense in our defined benefit pension plans of 048 over the 2008 level and ii an unfavorable impact of 018 compared with 2008 from translating foreign currencies into a stronger us dollar earnings per share in 2009 benefited from the absence of nonrecurring charges of 030 per share for cost reduction actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2008 

 

net income attributable to vf corporation decreased 2 to 6027 million in 2008 from 6132 million in 2007 while earnings per share increased to 542 in 2008 from 541 in 2007 cost reduction actions taken during the fourth quarter of 2008 lowered earnings per share by 030 cost reduction actions completed in 2007 partially offset by the gain on exiting the his ® business reduced 2007 earnings per share by 006 in translating foreign currencies into the us dollar the weaker us dollar had a 015 favorable impact on earnings per share in 2008 compared with 2007 discrete tax items accounted for an incremental benefit of 016 in 2008 earnings per share over 2007 earnings per share increased slightly in 2008 on lower income from continuing operations due to the reduced number of diluted shares outstanding in 2008 

 

information by business segment 

 

for business segment reporting purposes coalition revenues and coalition profit represent net sales royalty income and operating expenses under the direct control of an individual coalition along with its share of centralized corporate expenses directly related to the coalition and amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets corporate expenses not apportioned to the coalitions impairment charges for goodwill and intangible assets net interest expense and a significant portion of our pension expense are excluded from coalition profit 

 

see note r to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of our results of operations and other information by coalition along with a reconciliation of coalition profit to income from continuing operations before income taxes to leverage the scale of vf there are a number of functions that are shared across all coalitions accordingly coalition results are not necessarily indicative of operating results that would have been reported had each business coalition been an independent standalone entity during the periods presented further vf’s presentation of coalition profit may not be comparable with similar measures used by other companies 

  the following tables present a summary of the changes in our total revenues and coalition profit by coalition during the last two years 

 

 

 

 

 

operating results of the john varvatos business unit for 2007 and 2008 have been reclassified from the sportswear coalition to the contemporary brands coalition reflecting the change in internal management responsibility which began in 2009 

 

outdoor  action sports 

 

 

 

the outdoor  action sports coalition consists of vf’s outdoor and action sportsrelated businesses including the north face ® brand apparel footwear and equipment vans ® performance and casual footwear and apparel jansport ® and eastpak ® daypacks and apparel kipling ® bags and accessories napapijri ® outdoorbased sportswear reef ® beachinspired footwear and apparel and eagle creek ® adventure travel gear 

  coalition revenues in 2009 increased slightly on a reported basis compared with 2008 and 3 on a constant currency basis reported global revenues of the two largest brands in this coalition increased in 2009 — the north face ® by 6 including a negative impact of 3 from foreign currency translation and vans ® by 5 including a negative impact of 2 from foreign currency translation in addition revenues in asia increased by more than 50 largely due to increases in the vans ® brand which was just introduced into china in 2008 these increases were offset by the impact of foreign currency translation and revenue declines in the other coalition businesses 

 

coalition revenues increased in 2008 led by global unit gains from strong consumer demand for our the north face ®  vans ®  kipling ®  napapijri ® and eastpak ® brands growth in these brands particularly the north face ® and vans ®  included geographic expansion and the opening of additional owned retail locations domestic revenues for our outdoor and action sports businesses increased 11 while international revenues increased 21 with the favorable effects of foreign currency accounting for 6 of this increase 

 

approximately onehalf of the operating margin improvement in 2009 over 2008 resulted from increased gross margins in our outdoor and action sports businesses with their directtoconsumer revenues making up a larger portion of total coalition revenues in 2009 in addition the 2009 operating margin comparison benefited by 03 from an 83 million nonrecurring charge in 2008 related to cost reduction actions the remainder of the operating margin improvement in 2009 over 2008 was due to lower spending partially offset by continued investments to expand the directtoconsumer business 

 

the increase in operating margin in 2008 over 2007 was driven by higher revenues resulting in improved leverage of operating expenses and growth in our international and directtoconsumer operations where operating margins are higher these improvements were partially offset by the charge related to cost reduction actions mentioned above 

 

jeanswear 

 

 

 

the jeanswear coalition consists of our global jeanswear businesses led by the wrangler ® and lee ® brands 

 

domestic jeanswear revenues declined 4 in 2009 from 2008 due primarily to a difficult retail environment including the loss of volume from customers who filed for bankruptcy in 2008 and a reduction in noncore riders ® brand plus size and seasonal programs despite these reductions we believe that we are gaining market share in our wrangler ® men’s lee ® men’s and women’s and core riders ® women’s businesses driven by the success of new product innovation domestic jeanswear revenues decreased 8 in 2008 from 2007 due to a very difficult retail environment caused by the deteriorating global economy that impacted the lee mass market and western specialty businesses 

 

jeanswear revenues in international markets including europe canada mexico latin america and asia declined 18 in 2009 from 2008 with 8 of the decline resulting from the negative impact of foreign currency translation the remainder of the decline was driven by recessionary conditions especially in europe and the decision earlier in 2009 to exit our mass market jeans business in europe these declines were partially offset by a 14 increase in jeanswear revenues in asia 

 

jeanswear revenues in international markets increased 2 in 2008 over 2007 foreign currency translation positively impacted international jeanswear 2008 revenues by 5 therefore revenues on a constant currency basis were down in 2008 reflecting difficult economic conditions in key european countries and the sale of the his ® business in 2007 which accounted for 25 million of revenues in that year these declines were partially offset by revenue growth in our asia business 

  the jeanswear operating margin comparison in 2009 benefited by 10 from nonrecurring charges in 2008 of 273 million related to cost reduction actions the negative impact of higher distressed inventory provisions in our european businesses in 2009 was offset by lower spending across the coalition due in part to the cost reduction actions taken in 2008 

 

jeanswear operating margin in 2008 was negatively impacted compared with 2007 due to the charges in 2008 discussed above lower revenues that negatively impacted the expense to revenue ratio increased promotional activities and higher product costs the 2007 operating margin was favorably impacted by 02 related to the gain on the sale of his ® trademarks and related intellectual property during that year 

 

imagewear 

 

 

 

the imagewear coalition consists of vf’s image division occupational apparel and uniforms and the licensed sports division owned and licensed high profile sports and lifestyle apparel 

 

image apparel revenues declined 17 in 2009 from 2008 due to rising unemployment particularly in the manufacturing and petrochemical sectors licensed sports revenues were down 8 in 2009 from 2008 resulting from lower attendance at sporting events and the overall weak retail environment and the highly discretionary nature of consumer spending on these products coalition revenues were flat in both our image and licensed sports divisions in 2008 compared with 2007 

 

operating margin declined in 2009 from 2008 due to revenue declines that negatively impacted the expense to revenue ratio and economic factors that affected obligations under royalty agreements in our licensed sports division 

 

the operating margin decline in 2008 from 2007 reflected difficult market conditions in the fourth quarter of 2008 that especially affected consumer spending in our licensed sports division in addition the 2008 operating results included a 20 million nonrecurring charge for cost reduction activities that negatively impacted the operating margin by 02 and additional investments in advertising that accounted for 04 of the margin decline 

 

sportswear 

 

 

 

the sportswear coalition consists of our nautica ® lifestyle brand and the kipling ® brand business in north america whereas the kipling ® brand is managed as part of the outdoor  action sports coalition outside north america 

 

the decline in coalition revenues in 2009 from 2008 was driven by a 13 decrease in nautica ® brand revenues the decline in the nautica business resulted from difficult market conditions in the department store channel and lower volume in our retail outlet stores 

 

coalition revenues were down 7 in 2008 compared with 2007 with an 11 decrease in our nautica ® brand revenues partially offset by a doubledigit revenue gain in our kipling ® brand businesses the decline in the nautica business resulted from the very challenging department and outlet store trends mentioned above and the exit in early 2008 of our women’s wholesale business 

  sportswear coalition operating margin improved in 2009 from 2008 due to aggressive cost and inventory reduction actions in our nautica business also the 2009 operating margin comparison benefited by 10 from 58 million in nonrecurring charges in 2008 related to cost reduction actions including the exit of the nautica ® women’s wholesale sportswear business 

 

sportswear coalition operating margin declined in 2008 from 2007 due to lower nautica ® brand revenues that negatively impacted the expense to revenue ratio and increased markdown activity related to a highly promotional retail environment in addition as mentioned above the 2008 operating results included nonrecurring charges for cost reduction actions that negatively impacted the operating margin by 10 

 

contemporary brands 

 

 

 

this coalition consists of the 7 for all mankind ® brand of premium denim jeanswear and related apparel john varvatos ® luxury apparel collection for men and lucy ® brand of women’s activewear this coalition also includes the operating results of the splendid ® and ella moss ® brands comprised of the earnings from our onethird equity investment from june 2008 through march 2009 when the remaining twothirds equity interest was purchased and the consolidated operating results thereafter 

 

the increase in coalition revenues in 2009 was driven by the acquisition of the splendid ® and ella moss ® brands in march 2009 this increase was partially offset by an 8 decline in our global 7 for all mankind ® brand revenues driven by challenging conditions in the us upper tier department and specialty store channel we did experience growth in both the 7 for all mankind ® asia business where revenues nearly doubled and the directtoconsumer business where revenues more than tripled we continued to expand this brand’s reach with 21 retail store openings in 2009 

 

the increase in coalition revenues in 2008 was due to a full year of ownership of the 7 for all mankind ® and lucy ® brands 

 

operating margin was negatively impacted in 2009 compared with 2008 due to volume declines in our 7 for all mankind ® wholesale business that negatively impacted the expense to revenue ratio increased retail investments across the coalition and higher operating losses in our lucy ® and john varvatos ® businesses the 2009 operating margin comparison benefited by 15 from nonrecurring charges in 2008 related to an unremitted valueadded tax and duty matter and cost reduction initiatives operating margins for our 7 for all mankind ®  splendid ® and ella moss ® brands in 2009 were above the coalition average at 16 and 20 respectively 

 

the operating margin decline in 2008 from 2007 reflects high levels of promotion and markdownrelated expenses as a result of the significant impact of the economic downturn on the more upscale department stores in addition as mentioned above the 2008 operating results included nonrecurring charges that negatively impacted operating margin by 15 

 

other 

 

 

  the other business segment includes the vf outlet business which is a group of vfoperated retail outlet stores in the united states that sell a broad selection of excess quantities of vf products and other branded products revenues and profits of vf products are reported as part of the operating results of the applicable coalitions while revenues and profits of nonvf products primarily women’s intimate apparel childrenswear hosiery underwear and accessories which provide a broader selection of merchandise to attract consumer traffic are reported in this business segment revenues in the other business segment declined in 2009 due to the impact of the economic recession on consumer spending 

 

reconciliation of coalition profit to consolidated income from continuing operations before income taxes 

 

there are three types of costs necessary to reconcile total coalition profit as discussed in the preceding paragraphs to income from continuing operations before income taxes these costs discussed below are impairment of goodwill and trademarks interest and corporate and other expenses see also note r to the consolidated financial statements 

 

impairment of goodwill and trademarks was discussed in the previous “consolidated statements of income” section these charges resulted from our annual impairment review of these assets 

 

interest expense net was discussed in the previous “consolidated statements of income” section interest is excluded from coalition profit because substantially all of our financing costs are managed at the corporate office and are not under the control of coalition management 

 

corporate and other expenses consists of corporate headquarters’ and similar costs that are not apportioned to the operating coalitions these expenses are summarized as follows 

 

 

 

information systems and shared services  — included are costs of our management information systems and our centralized shared services center which includes common financial supply chain human resources and customer management services that support our worldwide operations operating costs of information systems and shared services are charged to the coalitions based on utilization of those services such as minutes of computer processing time number of transactions or number of users costs to develop new computer applications that will be used across vf are not allocated to the coalitions the decrease in information systems and shared services costs in 2009 from 2008 is primarily due to reductions in thirdparty data center charges and common systems amortization the decrease in information systems and shared services costs in 2008 from 2007 resulted primarily from information systems costs incurred in 2007 for transition services provided to the acquirer of our intimate apparel business that did not recur in 2008 the reimbursement of these costs from the acquirer in 2007 is separately presented above 

 

corporate headquarters’ costs  — headquarters’ costs include compensation and benefits of corporate management and staff certain legal and professional fees and administrative and general expenses which are not apportioned to the coalitions the decline in corporate headquarters’ costs in 2009 from 2008 was due to reduced spending as part of our cost reduction efforts the decrease in corporate headquarters’ costs in 2008 from 2007 resulted primarily from lower management incentive compensation 

  trademark maintenance and enforcement  — legal and other costs of registering maintaining and enforcing the majority of vf’s trademarks plus related costs of licensing administration are controlled by a centralized trademark and licensing staff and are not allocated to the coalitions 

 

other  — this category includes i costs that result from corporate programs or corporatemanaged decisions that are not allocated to the business units for internal management reporting ii adjustments to convert the earnings of certain business units using the fifo inventory valuation method for internal reporting to the lifo method for consolidated financial reporting and iii other consolidating adjustments the most significant of these other adjustments is related to the expense of our centrallymanaged us defined benefit pension plans coalition profit of the business units includes only their current year service cost component of pension expense pension costs totaling 831 million for 2009 primarily representing amortization of deferred actuarial losses were recorded in “other” expense these costs were not significant in prior years 

 

analysis of financial condition 

 

balance sheets 

 

accounts receivable decreased 9 in 2009 due to the sale of 742 million of selected accounts receivable as discussed in the “liquidity and cash flows” section below 

 

inventories declined 17 in 2009 reflecting our aggressive management of inventory levels during the economic downturn 

 

other current assets decreased at december 2009 from 2008 due primarily to a decrease in prepaid income taxes 

 

property plant and equipment was lower at the end of 2009 compared with 2008 as depreciation expense exceeded our capital spending in 2009 

 

intangible assets increased in 2009 due to the mo industries acquisition in march 2009 partially offset by the impairment charge and amortization 

 

goodwill increased in 2009 due to the mo industries acquisition in march 2009 partially offset by the impairment charge 

 

other assets decreased at december 2009 due to i the completion of the acquisition of mo industries in march 2009 resulting in the elimination of the 805 million equity investment in onethird of its stock and ii a reduction in deferred income tax assets these decreases were partially offset by an increase in the investment securities held for vf’s deferred compensation plans 

 

vf has a 10 billion senior unsecured committed domestic revolving bank credit agreement that supports issuance of up to 10 billion in commercial paper and a €2500 million us dollar equivalent of 3583 million senior unsecured committed international revolving bank credit agreement there were no borrowings under these credit agreements at december 2009 or december 2008 shortterm borrowings under other international borrowing agreements were 455 million at december 2009 and 536 million at december 2008 

 

the decline in accounts payable from 2008 to 2009 is consistent with the decline in inventories discussed above accrued liabilities decreased in 2009 due primarily to the payments of the obligations associated with the cost reduction actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2008 

 

total longterm debt at december 2009 and december 2008 was comparable at september 2009 2000 million of notes due october 1 2010 were reclassified to current portion of longterm debt 

 

other liabilities decreased due to the reduction in the underfunded status of our defined benefit pension plans at the end of 2009 as discussed in the following paragraph this decrease is partially offset by higher deferred income taxes and deferred compensation liabilities 

 

the global credit crisis and the related significant declines in global securities markets during 2008 resulted in a significant decline in the value of the investment portfolios of our defined benefit pension plans as a result our defined benefit pension plans are in an underfunded status with our projected pension benefit obligations exceeding 

  the value of our plans’ investment assets in december 2008 the underfunded status of 4149 million was recognized as a liability in our consolidated balance sheet to improve the funded status of our pension plans we contributed over 200 million to these plans during 2009 accordingly the plans’ underfunded status recognized in our 2009 consolidated balance sheet was reduced to 2509 million see note n to the consolidated financial statements and the “critical accounting policies and estimates” section below for a discussion of asset liability and equity balances related to defined benefit pension plans 

 

liquidity and cash flows 

 

the financial condition of vf is reflected in the following 

 

 

 

for the ratio of debt to total capital debt is defined as shortterm and longterm borrowings and total capital is defined as debt plus stockholders’ equity our ratio of net debt to total capital with net debt defined as debt less cash and equivalents was 107 at the end of 2009 

 

vf’s primary source of liquidity is its strong cash flow provided by operating activities cash generated from operations which was 9735 million in 2009 6795 million in 2008 and 8336 million in 2007 is primarily dependent on the level of net income changes in accounts receivable investments in inventories and other working capital components net income was 4585 million 6028 million and 5922 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively the decline in net income in 2009 was primarily due to a noncash pretax impairment charge for goodwill and intangible assets of 1220 million 

 

operating cash flow for 2009 included 2000 million of discretionary contributions to our us qualified defined benefit pension plan there were no contributions to this plan in 2007 or 2008 because of the funded status of the plan at the beginning of each of those years although vf is not required and does not currently intend to make a funding contribution to the domestic qualified plan during 2010 management is committed to returning each of our defined benefit plans to a fully funded status vf has adequate liquidity to meet future funding requirements we will continue to evaluate the funded status of our retirement plans and future funding requirements 

 

the net change in operating asset and liability components provided an increase to operating cash flow of 2281 million in 2009 in contrast to reducing operating cash flows by 1506 million in 2008 and 125 million in 2007 the positive cash generation from these components in 2009 was driven by our aggressive management of inventory levels and the sale of selected accounts receivable discussed in the paragraph below the changes in operating cash flow from other current assets resulted from an unusually high amount of prepaid income taxes at the end of 2008 operating cash flow in 2008 benefited from an additional week of collections on accounts receivable in the 53 rd week of the fiscal year that is collections sharply exceeded credit sales in the additional week operating cash flow in 2007 benefited from an unusually high accounts payable balance at the end of 2007 related to the timing of payments that resulted in higher accounts payable disbursements in 2008 

 

during september 2009 vf entered into an agreement to sell selected trade accounts receivable on a revolving basis to a financial institution this agreement covers the sale of up to 1050 million of accounts receivable on a nonrecourse basis net proceeds of this accounts receivable sale program are recognized in the statement of consolidated cash flows as part of the accounts receivable component of cash from operations the december 2009 balance of accounts receivable has been reduced by 742 million for amounts that had been sold under this program 

 

to finance ongoing operations and most unusual circumstances that may arise vf anticipates relying on continued future strong cash generation in addition vf has significant existing liquidity from its available cash balances and debt capacity supported by its strong credit rating at the end of 2009 9852 million was available for borrowing under vf’s 10 billion senior unsecured committed domestic revolving bank credit facility with 

  148 million of standby letters of credit issued under the agreement this credit facility is used primarily to support our seasonal commercial paper borrowings also at the end of 2009 €2500 million us dollar equivalent of 3583 million was available for borrowing under vf’s senior unsecured committed international revolving bank credit facility 

 

we used cash of 2123 million 934 million and 10606 million for acquisitions in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively which is net of cash balances in the acquired companies these acquisitions were funded with existing vf cash balances as well as for the 2007 acquisitions shortterm commercial paper borrowings and bank borrowings in 2007 we received 3487 million in proceeds from the sale of our intimate apparel business 

 

capital expenditures were 859 million in 2009 compared with 1242 million and 1139 million in 2008 and 2007 respectively capital expenditures in each of these years primarily related to our retail stores distribution network and information systems as well as maintenance spending across our global supply chain we expect that capital spending could reach 110 million in 2010 capital spending will be funded by cash flow from operations 

 

during 2007 vf received 5928 million in proceeds from the issuance of 6000 million principal amount of 595 senior notes due in 2017 and 645 senior notes due in 2037 also during 2007 vf paid 781 million under the international bank credit agreement and 330 million in notes related to the nautica acquisition see note l to the consolidated financial statements 

 

at the end of 2009 vf’s longterm debt ratings were ‘a minus’ by standard  poor’s ratings services and ‘a3’ by moody’s investors service and commercial paper ratings were ’a2’ and ’prime2’ respectively by those rating agencies both agencies have a ‘stable’ outlook for vf existing longterm debt agreements do not contain acceleration of maturity clauses based solely on changes in credit ratings however for the 6000 million of senior notes issued in 2007 if there were a change in control of vf and as a result of the change in control the notes were rated below investment grade by recognized rating agencies then vf would be obligated to repurchase the notes at 101 of the aggregate principal amount of notes repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest 

 

during 2009 2008 and 2007 vf purchased 16 million 20 million and 41 million shares respectively of its common stock in open market transactions the cost of these transactions was 1120 million 1497 million and 3500 million with an average price of 7180 in 2009 7486 in 2008 and 8503 in 2007 the primary objective of our share repurchase program is to offset on a longterm basis dilution caused by awards under equity compensation plans under its current authorization from the board of directors vf may purchase an additional 116 million shares including 100 million shares authorized subsequent to the end of 2009 we currently intend to repurchase at least 30 million shares in 2010 and will continue to evaluate future share repurchases considering funding required for business acquisitions our common stock price and levels of stock option exercises 

 

cash dividends totaled 237 per common share in 2009 compared with 233 in 2008 and 223 in 2007 our dividend payout rate was 460 in 2009 excluding the effect of the noncash goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge compared with payout rates of 430 in 2008 and 427 in 2007 on a longer term basis we expect to pay dividends of approximately 40 of our diluted earnings per share the current indicated annual dividend rate for 2010 is 240 per share 

  following is a summary of vf’s contractual obligations and commercial commitments at the end of 2009 that will require the use of funds 

 

 

 

 

  

we have other financial commitments at the end of 2009 that are not included in the above table but may require the use of funds under certain circumstances

during 2009 vf met its obligations when due from cash flows from operations and for seasonal needs issuance of commercial paper there were no borrowings under our domestic or international bank facilities during the year credit market conditions and the general contraction of liquidity in the united states and global capital markets during 2008 particularly during the last half of that year and continuing into early 2009 had a significant impact on the ability of many companies to access the commercial paper and other capital markets vf was able to issue commercial paper for seasonal working capital needs during this period although for generally shorter maturities and at higher spreads over us treasury interest rates than in prior years reflecting our investment grade credit rating and a 10 billion committed revolving bank credit facility that supports our commercial paper program if the commercial paper markets were not available vf has a total of 13 billion of liquidity available under its domestic and international committed revolving bank credit agreements that do not expire until october 2012 management believes that vf’s cash balances and funds provided by operating activities as well as unused committed bank credit lines additional borrowing capacity and access to equity markets taken as a whole provide i adequate liquidity to meet all of its current and longterm obligations when due ii adequate liquidity to fund capital expenditures and to maintain our dividend payout policy and iii flexibility to meet investment opportunities that may arise 

 

we do not participate in transactions with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships established to facilitate offbalance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes 

 

risk management 

 

vf is exposed to a variety of risks in the ordinary course of business discussed below and we regularly assess these potential risks we manage our exposures to these risks through our operating and financing activities and when appropriate by i taking advantage of naturally offsetting exposures within vf ii purchasing insurance from commercial carriers or iii creating offsetting positions through the use of derivative financial instruments derivative financial instruments are contracts whose value is based on or “derived” from changes in the value of an underlying currency exchange rate interest rate or other financial asset or index we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

 

insured risks  — we selfinsure a substantial portion of our property vehicle medical worker’s compensation director and officer and general liability exposures and purchase insurance from unrelated highly rated commercial carriers for losses in excess of exposures retained by vf 

 

cash and equivalents risks  — vf had 7315 million of cash and equivalents at the end of 2009 cash equivalents are highly liquid investments that mature within three months of their purchase these investments consist of institutional money market funds that invest only in obligations issued or guaranteed by the us government and time deposits in highly rated us and foreign commercial banks considering recent credit market conditions and the weakened financial condition of many banks and other financial institutions we continually monitor vf’s cash equivalents and the credit ratings of vf’s financial institutions similarly we monitor the credit quality of cash equivalents and fixed income investments in our pension plan portfolios 

 

defined benefit pension plan risks  — vf is subject to funding risks of its defined benefit pension plans due to substantial pension plan investment portfolio losses incurred in 2008 vf recognized a significant liability representing the underfunded status of the plans and a significant charge to stockholders’ equity at the end of 2008 we contributed over 200 million to the plans during 2009 and are committed to returning the plans to a fully funded status including making further contributions if necessary in future years at the end of 2009 the underfunded status of the plans had improved to 2509 million 

 

interest rate risks  — we limit the risk of interest rate fluctuations on net income and cash flows by managing our mix of fixed and variable interest rate debt in addition we may also use derivative financial instruments to minimize our interest rate risk since all of our longterm debt has fixed interest rates our interest rate exposure relates to changes in interest rates on variable rate shortterm borrowings for seasonal working capital needs these variable rate borrowings averaged approximately 220 million during 2009 however any change in interest rates would also affect interest income earned on vf’s cash equivalents based on average amounts of borrowings having variable interest rates and cash equivalents during 2009 the effect on reported net income of a hypothetical 10 change in interest rates would not be significant 

  foreign currency exchange rate risks  — vf is a global enterprise subject to the risk of foreign currency fluctuations approximately 30 of our revenues in 2009 were generated in international markets substantially all of our foreign businesses operate in functional currencies other than the us dollar assets and liabilities in these foreign businesses are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates during 2007 we entered into an international bank credit agreement that provides for eurodenominated borrowings although there were no borrowings under this agreement during 2009 borrowings under the agreement could be used to reduce the exposure to currency rate changes for our eurodenominated net assets net advances to and investments in our foreign businesses primarily in europe latin america and asia are considered to be longterm and accordingly foreign currency translation effects on those net assets are deferred as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders’ equity we do not hedge these net investments and do not hedge the translation of foreign currency operating results into the us dollar 

 

we monitor net foreign currency market exposures and in the ordinary course of business enter into derivative foreign currency contracts to hedge the effects of exchange rate fluctuations for a significant portion of our forecasted foreign currency cash flows or specific foreign currency transactions use of these financial instruments allows us to reduce the overall exposure to exchange rate movements on vf’s cash flows since gains and losses on these contracts will offset losses and gains on the cash flows or transactions being hedged our practice is to hedge a portion of our net foreign currency cash flows forecasted for periods of up to 20 months relating to crossborder inventory purchases production costs product sales and intercompany royalty payments by buying or selling primarily us dollar contracts against various currencies currently we use only forward exchange contracts but may use options or collars in the future 

 

if there were a hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates of 10 compared with rates at the end of 2009 the expected effect on the change in fair value of the hedging contracts outstanding would result in an unrealized loss on the consolidated balance sheet of approximately 90 million based on changes in the timing and amount of foreign currency exchange rate movements the actual unrealized loss could differ however any such change in the fair value of the hedging contracts would also result in an offsetting change in the fair value of the underlying balance sheet positions impacted by the currency rate changes 

 

counterparty risks  — vf is exposed to creditrelated losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to derivative hedging instruments to manage this risk we have established counterparty credit guidelines and enter into derivative transactions only with financial institutions with ’a minusa3’ investment grade credit ratings or better we continually monitor the credit rating of and our hedging positions with each counterparty additionally we utilize a portfolio of financial institutions to minimize our exposure to potential counterparty defaults and will adjust our positions if necessary we also monitor counterparty risk for derivative contracts within our defined benefit pension plans 

 

commodity price risks  — vf is exposed to market risks for the pricing of cotton and other fibers which may impact fabric prices we manage our fabric prices by obtaining fixed price commitments for denim and other fabrics in some cases for up to one year in advance vf has not historically managed nor do we currently intend to manage commodity price exposures by using derivative instruments 

 

deferred compensation and related investment security risks  — vf has nonqualified deferred compensation plans in which liabilities accrued for the plans’ participants are based on market values of investment funds that are selected by the participants the risk of changes in the market values of the participants’ investment selections is hedged by vf’s investment in a portfolio of securities that substantially mirrors the investment selections underlying the deferred compensation liabilities increases and decreases in deferred compensation liabilities are substantially offset by corresponding increases and decreases in the market value of vf’s investments resulting in an insignificant net exposure to our operating results and financial position 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

we have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to accurately and fairly report vf’s operating results and financial position in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states we apply these accounting policies in a consistent manner our significant accounting policies are summarized in note a to the consolidated financial statements 

  the application of these accounting policies requires that we make estimates and assumptions about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses contingent assets and liabilities and related disclosures these estimates assumptions and judgments are based on historical experience current trends and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis because our business cycle is relatively short ie from the date that we place an order to manufacture or purchase inventory until that inventory is sold and the trade receivable is collected actual results related to most of these estimates are known within a few months after any balance sheet date in addition we may retain outside specialists to assist in our evaluation in areas such as determining the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities in a business acquisition testing goodwill and intangible assets for possible impairment equity compensation pension benefits and selfinsured liabilities if actual results ultimately differ from previous estimates the revisions are included in results of operations in the period in which the actual amounts become known 

 

we believe the following accounting policies involve the most significant management estimates assumptions and management judgments used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements or are the most sensitive to change from outside factors we have discussed the application of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 

 

inventories 

 

our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value cost includes all material labor and overhead costs incurred to manufacture or purchase the finished goods overhead allocated to manufactured product is based on the normal capacity of our plants and does not include amounts related to idle capacity or abnormal production inefficiencies market value is based on a detailed review in each business unit at least quarterly of all inventories on the basis of individual styles or individual stylesizecolor stockkeeping units “skus” to identify slow moving or excess products discontinued and tobediscontinued products and offquality merchandise this review matches inventory on hand plus current production and purchase commitments with current and expected future sales orders for those units in inventory that are identified as slowmoving or excess or offquality we estimate their market value based on historical experience and current realization trends this evaluation performed using a systematic and consistent methodology requires forecasts of future demand market conditions and selling prices if the forecasted market value on an individual style or sku basis is less than cost we provide an allowance to reflect the lower value of that inventory this methodology recognizes inventory exposures on an individual style or sku basis at the time such losses are evident rather than at the time goods are actually sold historically these estimates of future demand and selling prices have not varied significantly from actual results due to our timely identification and rapid disposal of these reduced value inventories 

 

physical inventory counts are taken on a regular basis we provide for estimated inventory losses that have likely occurred since the last physical inventory date historically our physical inventory shrinkage has not been significant 

 

longlived assets 

 

we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to the fair values of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed with any excess purchase price recorded as goodwill we evaluate fair value using three valuation techniques — the replacement cost market and income methods — and weight the valuation method or methods based on what is most appropriate in the circumstances the process of assigning fair values particularly to acquired intangible assets is highly subjective 

 

our depreciation policies for property plant and equipment reflect judgments on their estimated economic lives and residual value if any our amortization policies for intangible assets reflect judgments on the estimated amounts and duration of future cash flows expected to be generated by those assets in evaluating expected benefits to be received for customerrelated intangible assets we consider historical attrition patterns for various groups of customers for licenserelated intangible assets we consider historical trends and anticipated license renewal periods based on our experience in renewing or extending similar arrangements regardless of whether there are explicit renewal provisions 

  we review property and definitelived intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable we test for possible impairment at the asset or asset group level which is the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows we measure recoverability of the carrying value of an asset or asset group by comparison with estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if the total of undiscounted cash flows exceeds the carrying value of the asset there is no impairment charge if the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset we estimate the fair value of the asset based on the present value of its future cash flows and recognize an impairment charge for the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value 

 

indefinitelived intangible assets consisting of major trademarks and goodwill are not subject to amortization rather we evaluate those assets for possible impairment as of the beginning of the fourth quarter as part of our annual strategic planning process or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of an asset may exceed its fair value fair value of an indefinitelived trademark intangible asset is based on an income approach using the relieffromroyalty method under this method forecasted global revenues for a trademark are assigned a royalty rate that would be charged to license the trademark in lieu of ownership from an independent party and fair value is the present value of those forecasted royalties avoided by owning the trademark if the fair value of the trademark intangible asset exceeds its carrying value there is no impairment charge if the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying value an impairment charge would be recognized for the difference 

 

we assess the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill at each reporting unit having goodwill using a required twostep approach our reporting units are either our coalitions or a component of a coalition if that component is a business unit for which discrete financial information is available and reviewed by coalition management two or more business units may be aggregated for impairment testing if they have similar economic characteristics in the first step of the goodwill impairment test we compare the carrying value of a business unit including its recorded goodwill to the fair value of the business unit we estimate the fair value of a business unit using both incomebased and marketbased valuation methodologies the principal method used is an incomebased method in which the business unit’s forecasted cash flows are discounted to a present value in the marketbased valuation method the fair value of a business unit is estimated using multiples of revenues and of earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” for i a group of comparable public companies and ii recent transactions if any involving comparable companies we evaluate the range of fair values developed from the income and marketbased methods and determine the best fair value estimate for our business unit if the fair value of the business unit exceeds its carrying value the goodwill is not impaired and no further review is required however if the fair value of the business unit is less than its carrying value we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of the impairment charge if any the second step involves a hypothetical allocation of the fair value of the business unit to its net tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill as if the business unit were newly acquired which results in an implied fair value of goodwill the amount of the impairment charge is the excess of the recorded goodwill over the implied fair value of goodwill 

 

the incomebased fair value methodology requires management’s assumptions and judgments regarding economic conditions in the markets in which we operate and conditions in the us capital markets many of which are outside management’s control at the business unit level fair value estimation requires management’s assumptions and judgments regarding the effects of overall economic conditions on the specific business unit along with assessment of the business unit’s strategies and forecasts of future cash flows forecasts of individual business unit cash flows involve management’s estimates and assumptions regarding 

 

 45 

   

  

under the marketbased fair value methodology judgment is required in evaluating market multiples and recent transactions management believes that the assumptions used for its impairment tests are representative of those that would be used by market participants performing similar valuations of our business units 

 

we evaluated our goodwill and indefinitelived trademark intangible assets for possible impairment during the fourth quarter of 2009 based on analysis of current and expected future economic conditions and our updated strategic plan for each of our business units we concluded that the carrying values of goodwill at our reef ®  nautica ® and lucy ® business units and the carrying values of trademark intangible assets at our reef ® and lucy ® business units exceeded their respective fair values accordingly we recognized in our 2009 consolidated statement of income impairment charges of 1019 million to write down the carrying value of goodwill and 201 million to write down the carrying value of nonamortized trademark intangible assets the total noncash charge of 1220 million had an insignificant impact on our financial position and no impact on our liquidity or debt agreements the charge was based on significant estimates and judgments by management changes to the fair value assumptions used for the reef ®  nautica ® and lucy ® business units potentially would have resulted in different goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges see notes g h and u of the consolidated financial statements for additional information about the impairment charges recorded for these business units 

 

for our other business units the estimated fair values of those business units and the fair values of their trademark intangible assets exceeded their respective carrying values as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2009 accordingly no goodwill or trademark impairment charges were recorded for our other business units 

 

for our reef ®  nautica ® and lucy ® business units and for our other business units it is possible that our conclusions regarding impairment of goodwill or trademark intangible assets could change in future periods if for example i overall economic conditions in 2010 or future years vary from our current assumptions ii business conditions or our strategies for a specific business unit change from our current assumptions iii investors require higher rates of return on equity investments in the marketplace or iv enterprise values of comparable publicly traded companies or of actual sales transactions of comparable companies were to decline resulting in lower multiples of revenues and ebitda a future impairment change for goodwill or intangible assets could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

 

stock options 

 

we use a lattice optionpricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees and nonemployee members of the board of directors we believe that a lattice model provides a refined estimate of the fair value of options because it can incorporate i historical option exercise patterns and multiple assumptions about future option exercise patterns for each of several groups of option holders and ii inputs that vary over time such as assumptions for interest rates and volatility we performed a rigorous review of all assumptions and believe that the assumptions employed in the valuation of each option grant are reflective of our outstanding options and underlying common stock and of our groups of option participants our lattice valuation is based on the assumptions listed in note p to the consolidated financial statements 

 

one of the critical assumptions in the valuation process is estimating the expected average life of the options before exercise for each option grant we based our estimates on evaluations of the historical and expected option exercise patterns for each of several groups of option holders that have historically exhibited different option exercise patterns these evaluations included i voluntary stock option exercise patterns based on a combination of changes in the price of vf common stock and periods of time that options are outstanding before exercise and ii involuntary exercise patterns resulting from turnover retirement and mortality 

 

volatility is another critical assumption requiring judgment we based our estimate of future volatility on a combination of implied and historical volatility implied volatility was based on shortterm 6 to 9 months publicly traded nearthemoney options on vf common stock we measured historical volatility over a ten year period 

  corresponding to the contractual term of the options using daily stock price observations our assumption for valuation purposes was that expected volatility starts at a level equal to the implied volatility and then transitions to the historical volatility over the remainder of the ten year option term 

 

pension obligations 

 

vf sponsors a qualified defined benefit pension plan covering most fulltime domestic employees initially employed before 2005 and an unfunded supplemental defined benefit plan that provides benefits that exceed limitations imposed by income tax regulations vf also sponsors defined benefit plans covering selected international employees the selection of appropriate actuarial assumptions for determination of our projected pension benefit liabilities and of our annual pension expense is significant due to the long time period over which benefits are accrued and paid we annually update participant demographics and the expected amount and timing of benefit payments we review annually the principal economic actuarial assumptions summarized in note n to the consolidated financial statements and modify them based on current rates and trends we also periodically review and modify as necessary other plan assumptions such as rates of compensation increases retirement termination disability and mortality we believe our assumptions are reflective of the participants in and benefits provided by the plans and result in the best estimate of the plans’ future experience actual results may vary from the actuarial assumptions used 

 

one of the critical assumptions used in the actuarial model is the discount rate this discussion of discount rate and the discussion of return on assets in the next paragraph relate specifically to our us pension plans which comprise over 90 of the assets and projected benefit liabilities of our combined domestic and international plans the discount rate is used to estimate the present value of future cash outflows required to meet our projected benefit obligations at each measurement date the discount rate reflects the interest rate inherent in the price that vf could settle its projected benefit obligations at the valuation date our discount rate assumption is based on current market interest rates we select our discount rate based on matching high quality corporate bond yields to the timing of projected benefit payments to be made to participants in our us pension plans we use the population of us corporate bonds rated ‘aa’ by moody’s investors service or if a moody’s rating is not available bonds rated ‘aa’ by two other recognized rating services from this population of over 500 such bonds having at least 50 million outstanding that are noncallablenonputtable unless with makewhole provisions we exclude the highest and lowest yielding bonds the plans’ projected benefit payments are matched to current market interest rates over the expected payment period and a present value is developed that produces a single equivalent discount rate that recognizes our plans’ distinct liability characteristics we believe that those ‘aa’ rated issues meet the “high quality” intent of the applicable accounting standards and that our 2009 discount rate of 605 appropriately reflects current market conditions and the longterm nature of projected benefit payments to participants in our domestic pension plans this lower discount rate compared with the rate of 650 at the end of 2008 reflects stabilization of the credit markets in the past year and the general decline in yields of high quality corporate bonds of all maturities the discount rate for our plans may be higher than rates used for plans at some other companies because of our plans’ longer duration of expected benefit payments due to i a higher percentage of female participants with a longer life expectancy and ii a higher percentage of inactive participants who will not begin receiving vested benefits for many years 

 

another critical assumption of the actuarial model is the expected longterm rate of return on investment assets in our domestic qualified plan’s pension trust our investment objective is to maximize the longterm return on a diversified portfolio of assets at an acceptable level of risk these risks include market interest rate credit liquidity and foreign securities risks investment assets are comprised of a diversified portfolio of domestic and international equity corporate and governmental fixed income real estate and commodity securities we develop a projected rate of return for each of our investment asset classes based on several factors including the estimated inflation rate the premium to be earned in excess of a riskfree return the premium for equity risk and the premium for longer duration fixed income securities the weighted average of the projected longterm rates of return for the various classes of assets held by the qualified plan provides the basis for the expected longterm rate of return actuarial assumption our rate of return assumption was 800 in 2009 and 2008 and 825 in 2007 the rate of return is a forwardlooking assumption while our actual compounded annual rate of return was lower than the 800 assumption for the trailing 10 and 15 year periods our compounded rate of return since 1981 has exceeded 9 we 

  have not changed the overall target mix of investment assets during 2009 however we altered the investment mix to add commodities as a new asset class looking forward we plan to increase the allocation of equity investments to international equity investments and reduce the allocation to domestic equity investments as the qualified plan becomes fully funded our intent is to lengthen the average duration of fixed income investments to more closely match expected benefit payments thereby better matching the effect of interest rate changes on a portion of the value of our plan’s investment assets with the benefit obligations they are intended to fund these changes in asset allocation should over time reduce the yeartoyear variability of our domestic plan’s funded status and resulting pension expense we will constantly challenge our plan’s asset allocation giving consideration to changes that will appropriately balance anticipated investment returns with risk based on an evaluation of market conditions projected market returns and planned changes in investment mix we will be using a rate of return assumption of 775 for our us plan for 2010 

 

the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans is reflected in the balance sheet as the excess or deficiency of pension plan assets compared with projected benefit obligations payable to plan participants in 2008 there was a significant decline in the market value of our pension plan investment assets due to the global credit and financial market crisis which resulted in the plans being underfunded by 4149 million at the end of 2008 this underfunded status was presented in our 2008 consolidated balance sheet by recognition of liabilities of that amount our underfunded status improved during 2009 primarily from substantial vf cash contributions to the plans totaling over 200 million and significant investment earnings on pension plan assets partially offset by an increase in projected benefit obligations due to a decline in the discount rate during the year the resulting underfunded status in our 2009 consolidated balance sheet was 2509 million represented by 33 million of current liabilities and 2476 million of noncurrent liabilities the funded status of our plans recognized in our consolidated balance sheets could change significantly in future years depending on investment portfolio performance the level of vf contributions to the pension plans changes in the discount rate used to value projected benefit obligations or other factors 

 

differences in any year between actual results and the respective actuarial assumptions eg investment performance discount rates and other assumptions do not affect that year’s pension expense but instead are deferred as unrecognized actuarial gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income in the balance sheet the substantial investment losses incurred in 2008 was the primary reason that the plans had over 450 million of pretax accumulated unrecognized actuarial losses at the end of 2008 which resulted in deferred actuarial losses of 2910 million after tax in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in our 2008 consolidated balance sheet during 2009 investment returns in our pension plans substantially exceeded the actuarially assumed investment return resulting in a deferred actuarial gain this was partially offset however by a deferred actuarial loss in 2009 from an increase in our projected benefit obligations resulting from a lower discount rate used to value those obligations at the end of 2009 accordingly our net pretax cumulative unrecognized actuarial losses of 4315 million at the end of 2009 resulted in deferred actuarial losses of 2660 million after tax in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in our 2009 consolidated balance sheet our policy is to amortize any unrecognized actuarial gains and losses to pension expense as follows amounts totaling less than 10 of the lower of investment assets or projected benefit obligations at the beginning of the year are not amortized amounts totaling 10 to 20 of projected benefit obligations are amortized over the expected average remaining service of active participants and amounts in excess of 20 of projected benefit obligations are amortized over five years 

 

pension expense recognized in our financial statements was 980 million in 2009 108 million in 2008 and 131 million in 2007 this compares with the cost of pension benefits actually earned by our covered active employees commonly called “service cost” of 149 million in 2009 and an average of 177 million per year over the last three years pension expense for 2009 was significantly higher than the annual service cost because 2009 included a significant cost component for amortization of accumulated unrecognized actuarial losses as discussed in the preceding paragraph looking forward our 2010 pension expense will also include a significant cost component but lower than in 2009 for amortization of accumulated unrecognized actuarial losses with this lower amortization cost component for 2010 and more importantly greater assumed earnings due to the sharp increase in plan assets during 2009 including over 200 million of vf contributions we expect our 2010 pension expense to decline to approximately 66 million 

  the sensitivity of changes in actuarial assumptions on our 2009 pension expense and on projected benefit obligations at the end of 2009 all other factors being equal is illustrated by the following 

 

 

 

as previously mentioned we made 2000 million of discretionary contributions to our domestic qualified pension plan during 2009 vf is not required under applicable regulations and does not currently intend to make a contribution to the domestic qualified pension plan during 2010 but does intend to make contributions totaling approximately 8 million during 2010 to its other pension plans we believe that vf has sufficient liquidity to make contributions to our pension plans as necessary in future years to return the plans to a fully or substantially fully funded status 

 

beginning in 2005 vf’s domestic defined benefit plans were closed to new entrants which did not affect the benefits of plan participants at that date or their accrual of future benefits domestic employees hired after 2004 plus employees at certain acquired businesses not covered by those plans participate in a defined contribution plan with vf contributing amounts based on a percentage of eligible compensation funds contributed are invested as directed by the participants this defined contribution feature did not have a significant effect on our total retirement benefit expense over the last three years however on a longerterm basis the service cost component of our defined benefit plans’ expense will decline as a percentage of our total retirement benefit expense and the yeartoyear variability of our retirement benefit expense should decrease 

 

income taxes 

 

as a global company vf is subject to income tax and files income tax returns in over 100 domestic and foreign jurisdictions each year the calculation of our income tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations which are subject to legal and factual interpretation and significant management judgment 

 

vf’s income tax returns are regularly examined by federal state and foreign tax authorities and those audits may result in proposed adjustments we have reviewed all issues raised upon examination as well as any exposure for issues that may be raised in future examinations we have evaluated these potential issues under the “morelikelythannot” standard of the accounting literature a tax position is recognized if it meets this standard and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized such judgments and estimates may change based on audit settlements court cases and interpretation of tax laws and regulations our income tax expense could be materially affected to the extent we prevail in a tax position or when the statute of limitations expires for a tax position for which accruals have been established or to the extent we are required to pay amounts greater than established accruals we do not currently anticipate any material impact on earnings from the ultimate resolution of income tax uncertainties there are no accruals for general or unknown tax expenses 

 

we have recorded 1436 million of deferred income tax assets related to operating loss and capital loss carryforwards and we have recorded 992 million of valuation allowances against those assets realization of deferred tax assets related to operating loss and capital loss carryforwards is dependent on future taxable income in specific jurisdictions the amount and timing of which are uncertain and on possible changes in tax laws and tax planning strategies if in our judgment it appears that we will not be able to generate sufficient taxable income or capital gains to offset losses during the carryforward periods we have recorded valuation allowances to reduce those deferred tax assets to amounts expected to be ultimately realized in addition we have recorded 112 million of valuation allowances against deferred income tax assets unrelated to operating loss and capital loss 

  carryforwards if in a future period we determine that the amount of deferred tax assets to be realized differs from the net recorded amount we would record an adjustment to income tax expense in that future period 

 

we have not provided us income taxes on a portion of our foreign subsidiaries’ undistributed earnings because we have asserted that these earnings are indefinitely reinvested in the respective foreign jurisdictions if we were to decide to remit those earnings to the united states in a future period our provision for income taxes could increase in that period 

 

nongaap financial information 

 

vf is a global company that reports financial information in us dollars in accordance with gaap foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations affect the amounts reported by vf from translating our foreign revenues and expenses into us dollars these exchange rate fluctuations can have a significant effect on reported operating results and accordingly can affect the comparability of reported results 

 

to better explain our operating results we use constant currency information which excludes the effects of changes in foreign currency translation rates to provide a framework to assess how our businesses performed relative to prior periods accordingly we have provided supplemental constant currency financial information which is a nongaap financial measure in the “analysis of results of operations” section constant currency information represents the current year reported revenues after adjustment to eliminate the translation effects of changes in exchange rates to calculate coalition revenues on a constant currency basis revenues for the current year period for entities reporting in currencies other than the us dollar are translated into us dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the comparable period of the prior year rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the current year period 

 

we believe the following supplemental constant currency financial information is useful to investors to facilitate comparisons of operating results and better identify trends in our businesses 

 

 

 

in addition we discuss operating results in the preceding “analysis of results of operations” section excluding the impairment charge for goodwill and intangible assets we believe this nongaap financial 

  information is useful to investors to facilitate comparisons of operating results and better identify trends in our businesses 

 

 

 

 

above amounts may not add due to rounding 

 

these constant currency and other nongaap performance measures should be viewed in addition to and not in lieu of or superior to our financial results calculated in accordance with gaap also this supplemental information may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 

 

cautionary statement on forwardlooking statements 

 

from time to time we may make oral or written statements including statements in this annual report that constitute “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of the federal securities laws these include statements concerning plans objectives projections and expectations relating to vf’s operations or economic performance and assumptions related thereto 

 

forwardlooking statements are made based on our expectations and beliefs concerning future events impacting vf and therefore involve a number of risks and uncertainties we caution that forwardlooking statements are not guarantees and actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forwardlooking statements 

 

known or unknown risks uncertainties and other factors that could cause the actual results of operations or financial condition of vf to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forwardlooking statements are summarized in item 1a of this annual report

conclusion regarding the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures 

 

under the supervision of the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer vf conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of vf’s “disclosure controls and procedures” as defined in rules 13a15e or 15d15e of the securities and exchange act of 1934 the “exchange act” as of january 2 2010 these require that vf ensure that information required to be disclosed by vf in reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission’s rules and forms and that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to vf’s management including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures based on vf’s evaluation the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer concluded that vf’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective 

 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting

for over 100 years vf has grown by offering consumers high quality high value branded apparel and related products since 2004 we have been implementing a growth plan that is transforming vf’s mix of business to include more lifestyle brands lifestyle brands are those brands that connect closely with consumers because they are aspirational and inspirational they reflect consumers’ specific activities and interests lifestyle brands generally extend across multiple product categories and have higher than average gross margins accordingly this transformation has included the acquisitions of several growing lifestyle brands such as vans ®  reef ®  kipling ®  napapijri ®  7 for all mankind ® and lucy ®  at the same time we have continued to invest in our other businesses including extending the north face ® brand to new product categories and new markets enhancing product development and marketing strategy in our nautica ® men’s sportswear business and expanding lee ®  wrangler ®  the north face ® and several other brands into asian and eastern european markets 

 

an important step in vf’s transformation was the sale in 2007 of our women’s intimate apparel business which had over 800 million in revenues but lower profit and growth prospects this business is separately reported as discontinued operations in this annual report the remaining discussion of vf’s business unless otherwise stated is focused on vf’s continuing operations see additional discussion regarding our discontinued operations in note c to the consolidated financial statements included at item 8 of this annual report 

 

vf is a highly diversified apparel company — across brands product categories channels of distribution and geographies vf owns a broad portfolio of brands in the jeanswear outerwear packs footwear sportswear and occupational apparel categories these products are marketed to consumers shopping in specialty stores upscale and traditional department stores national chains and mass merchants a growing portion of our revenues currently 16 are derived from sales directly to consumers through vfoperated retail stores and internet sites a global company vf derives 30 of its revenues from outside the united states primarily in europe asia canada and latin america vf products are also sold in some countries through licensees and distributors to provide many types of products across numerous channels of distribution in different geographic areas we balance efficient and flexible internallyowned manufacturing with sourcing of finished goods from independent contractors an array of stateoftheart technologies provide us with among other things sophisticated inventory replenishment capabilities that enable us to get consumerright products on time to our customers’ shelves 

 

vf’s businesses are organized primarily into product categories and by brands within those categories for both management and internal financial reporting purposes these groupings of businesses are called “coalitions” and consist of the following outdoor and action sports jeanswear imagewear sportswear and contemporary brands these coalitions are treated as reportable segments for financial reporting purposes coalition management has responsibility to build their brands with certain financial administrative and systems support and disciplines provided by consolidated functions within vf 

 

we consider our outdoor and action sports sportswear and contemporary brands coalitions to be our lifestyle coalitions these are vf’s growth engines where we expect longterm revenue and profit growth at a midsingle digit to lowdouble digit rate our jeanswear and imagewear coalitions are our heritage businesses where our focus is on strong profitability and cash flows with longterm revenue growth expectations at a lowsingle digit rate 

  the following table summarizes vf’s primary owned and licensed brands by coalition 

 

 

 

financial information regarding vf’s coalitions as well as geographic information and sales by product category are included in note r to the consolidated financial statements which are included at item 8 of this report 

 

outdoor and action sports coalition 

 

our outdoor and action sports coalition vf’s fastest growing business is a group of outdoor and activitybased businesses that represent a collection of lifestyle brands product offerings include outerwear sportswear footwear equipment backpacks daypacks luggage and accessories

kipling ® handbags shoulder bags backpacks luggage and accessories are stylish colorful and fun products that are both practical and durable the brand name comes from the author of the jungle book  rudyard kipling and that provides the connection to the kipling ® monkey mascot which symbolizes fun and adventure a colorful monkey key ring is attached to every bag with a different monkey design for each product collection products are sold through specialty stores in europe asia and south america as well as through approximately 30 vfoperated and over 170 independentlyoperated retail stores the kipling ® business in north america is managed as part of the sportswear coalition

we expect continued longterm growth in our outdoor and action sports coalition as we expand into new product categories open additional retail stores expand geographically and acquire additional outdoor or activitybased lifestyle brands 

 

jeanswear coalition 

 

our jeanswear coalition markets jeanswear and related casual products in the united states and in many international markets the largest of these brands the lee ® and wrangler ® brands have longstanding traditions as authentic american jeans brands as they were established in 1889 and 1947 respectively and have strong market 

  positions lee ® and wrangler ® products are sold in nearly every developed country products also include shorts casual pants knit and woven tops and outerwear which are designed to complement the jeanswear products and have helped to extend our brands 

 

in domestic markets lee ® products are sold primarily through national chain stores and specialty stores wrangler ® westernwear is marketed through western specialty stores the wrangler hero ®  rustler ® and riders ® brands are marketed to mass merchant and regional discount stores despite significant competitive activity vf’s domestic jeanswear revenues have been stable in recent years including all of its jeanswear brands we believe that vf has the largest unit market share of jeans in the united states and is one of the largest marketers of jeans in the world we also market cotton casual pants under the lee casuals ®  timber creek by wrangler ® and wrangler ® khakis brands 

 

we believe our vendormanaged inventory and retail floor space management programs with several of our major retailer customers give us a competitive advantage in our domestic jeanswear business we receive pointofsale information from these customers on a daily basis on an individual store and stylesizecolor stockkeeping unit “sku” level we then ship products based on customer data to ensure their selling floors are appropriately stocked with products that match their shoppers’ needs our systems capabilities allow us to analyze our retail customer’s sales demographic and geographic data to develop product assortment recommendations that maximize the productivity of their jeanswear selling space and minimize their investment in inventory 

 

jeanswear in most international markets is more fashionoriented and has a higher selling price than similar products in the united states the jeans market internationally is also more fragmented than in the united states with competitors ranging from global brands to a number of smaller national or regional brands 

 

vf’s largest international jeanswear business is located in western europe during 2008 we acquired the remaining portion of our former 50owned joint venture that markets lee ® branded products in spain and portugal this business is being integrated with our existing european jeanswear business lee ® and wrangler ® jeanswear products are sold through department stores and specialty stores where we employ some of the same retail floor space management programs described above we also market lee ® and wrangler ® products to mass market and specialty stores in canada and mexico as well as to department stores and specialty stores in asia and south america in many international markets we are expanding our reach through vfoperated retail stores an increasingly important vehicle for presenting our brands’ image and marketing message directly to consumers we are continuing to expand our jeanswear brands in emerging markets such as china and russia and through our majorityowned joint venture in india in foreign markets where vf does not have owned operations lee ® and wrangler ® jeanswear and related products are marketed through distributors agents or licensees lee ® and wrangler ® products are sold in over 500 independently operated single brand retail stores primarily in eastern europe and south america 

 

in the united states we believe our jeanswear coalition can grow its jeans market share in the mass market and national chain channels of distribution through superior consumer insight and marketing strategies and continuous product innovation in our international businesses growth will be driven by i product innovation positioning and marketing in europe and latin america ii expansion of our existing businesses in asia particularly in china russia and india and iii the continued rollout of new retail stores 

 

imagewear coalition 

 

our imagewear coalition consists of the image division occupational apparel and uniforms and the activewear division owned and licensed high profile sports and lifestyle apparel each division represents approximately onehalf of coalition revenues 

 

the image division provides occupational apparel for workers around the world uniform and career apparel are sold in north america and internationally primarily in europe under the red kap ® brand a premium workwear brand with more than 75 years of history the bulwark ® brand flame resistant and protective apparel the the force ® brand apparel for law enforcement and public safety personnel and the chef designs tm brand restaurant and food service apparel products include work pants slacks work and dress shirts overalls jackets 

  and smocks in 2009 the image division will launch a new services apparel line featuring highend tailored apparel marketed under the licensed joseph abboud ® brand approximately twothirds of image division sales are to industrial laundries resellers and distributors that in turn supply customized workwear to employers primarily on a rental basis for onthejob wear by production service and whitecollar personnel since industrial laundries maintain minimal inventories of work clothes a supplier’s ability to offer rapid delivery of products in a broad range of sizes is an important factor in this market our commitment to customer service supported by an automated central distribution center with several satellite locations has enabled customer orders to be filled within 24 hours of receipt and has helped the red kap ® and bulwark ® brands obtain a significant share of the industrial laundry rental business 

 

the image division also develops and manages uniform programs through customdesigned websites for major business customers eg fedex corporation air canada continental airlines and american airlines and governmental organizations eg us customs and border protection transportation security administration national park service fire department of new york city and new york city transit authority these websites give employees of these customers the convenience of shopping for their work and career apparel via the internet 

 

in the activewear division we design and market sports apparel and fanwear under licenses granted by the major sports leagues individual athletes and related organizations including major league baseball the national football league the national basketball association the national hockey league nascar espn inc and many major colleges and universities under license from major league baseball majestic ® brand uniforms are worn exclusively onfield by all 30 major league teams majestic ® brand adult and youthsize authentic replica jersey and casual fanwear are sold through department sporting goods and athletic specialty stores adult and youth sports apparel products marketed under other licensed labels are distributed through department mass market sporting goods and athletic specialty stores in addition the activewear division is a major supplier of licensed harleydavidson ® apparel marketed to harleydavidson dealerships with the exception of the major league baseball license loss of any license would not have a material effect on the imagewear coalition 

 

the opportunities to grow our imagewear coalition revenues include i the extension of its product and service capabilities into new markets such as hospitalityservices ii growth of its majestic ® brand through expansion to new domestic and international customers updates to key authentic and replica products and ecommerce iii growth of the national football league business through recently acquired rights to additional apparel categories iv market share gains in key licensed categories and v the extension of vf’s floor space management and replenishment capabilities to more retail doors placing the productright assortments on the sales floor in each geographic market looking forward we intend to drive image and activewear growth by leveraging the coalition’s ability to manage a complex mix of products where speedtomarket product customization and superior service give us a competitive advantage 

 

sportswear coalition 

 

the nautica ® brand is the principal lifestyle brand of the sportswear coalition nautica ® sportswear is marketed in the department store and specialty store channels of distribution in the united states the department store channel has undergone significant consolidation in the last few years resulting in numerous store closings and negatively impacting sales of nautica ® brand products the principal nautica ® product line is men’s sportswear noted for its classic styling we believe nautica ® is the number two men’s collection sportswear brand in national department stores the nautica jeans company ® line features fashionable jeanswear and related tops for younger male consumers other nautica ® product lines include men’s outerwear underwear and swimwear and men’s and women’s sleepwear nautica ® women’s sportswear initially launched in the department store channel in late 2006 did not meet our expectations and was discontinued in that channel of distribution in 2008 women’s sportswear continues to be marketed at wwwnauticacom and in select nautica ® outlet stores 

 

the sportswear coalition operates approximately 110 nautica ® retail outlet stores in better outlet malls across the united states these stores carry nautica ® merchandise for men women boys girls and infants the product styles sold in the outlet stores are different from the nautica ® styles sold to department and specialty store wholesale customers these outlet stores also carry nautica ® merchandise from licensees to complete their product assortment in addition independent licensees operate over 200 nautica ® brand retail stores across the world 

  the nautica ® brand is licensed to independent parties in the united states for apparel categories not produced by vf eg tailored clothing dress shirts neckwear women’s swimwear accessories such as fragrances watches and eyewear and for nonapparel categories eg bed and bath linens and accessories nautica ® products are licensed for sale in over 60 countries outside the united states wholesale sales of nautica ® licensed products total approximately 470 million on an annual basis 

 

the john varvatos ® brand is a rapidly growing luxury apparel and accessories collection for men including tailored clothing sportswear footwear and accessories the john varvatos  usa ® line of tailored clothing sportswear and accessories is designed to appeal to a younger consumer at somewhat more accessible price points a john varvatos  usa ® line of footwear will be launched in 2009 products are sold through upscale department and specialty stores primarily in the united states as well as through eight showcase john varvatos ® retail locations this business is 80 owned by vf with the balance owned by mr john varvatos 

 

the sportswear coalition also includes the kipling ® business in north america kipling ® handbags backpacks totes luggage and accessories are sold in the united states through specialty stores department stores vfoperated retail stores and at wwwkiplingcom about twothirds of products are the same as those sold in europe with the remainder designed specifically for the us market 

 

we believe there is revenue and profit growth potential in each of our sportswear brands through the expansion of owned retail stores the expansion in the number of individual retailers offering our products and improved product offerings at accessible price points 

 

contemporary brands coalition 

 

contemporary brands our newest coalition is focused on upscale lifestyle brands formed in august 2007 it is currently composed of the 7 for all mankind ® and lucy ® brands in addition in may 2008 we acquired onethird of the outstanding equity of mo industries holdings inc “mo industries” a los angelesbased company that owns the splendid ® and ella moss ® brands of premium knitwear marketed to better department and specialty stores vf expects to acquire the remaining twothirds of the outstanding equity of mo industries in the first half of 2009 

 

7 for all mankind ® is a los angelesbased brand of contemporary denim jeans and related products — knit and woven tops sweaters jackets and accessories — for women and men products are noted for their fit and for innovation in design fabric and finish we believe the 7 for all mankind ® brand is the leading premium jeans brand in the united states with the premium segment defined as jeans retailing for 150 or more retail price points for the brand’s core jeans range from 155 — 199 for basics with higher price points for more fashionforward products with approximately threefourths of its sales in the united states the brand is marketed through department stores such as bloomingdale’s macy’s neiman marcus nordstrom and saks and through specialty stores in addition the brand is sold in vfoperated retail locations we opened 13 retail stores in prime street fronts or malls in the united states during 2008 bringing the total to 15 internationally sales are through department stores such as harrods and specialty stores we are pursuing growth opportunities in several areas — additional directtoconsumer expansion through companyoperated retail stores and ecommerce additional sportswear product offerings further geographic expansion in the eastern european and asian markets and licensing 

 

based in portland oregon the lucy ® brand of women’s lifestyle apparel is marketed through approximately 60 lucy ® branded retail stores across the united states and via the internet lucy ® is an activewear brand designed for versatility comfort and fit for today’s active woman lucy ® is an authentic activewear brand with functional product that women can wear from workout to weekend the lucy ® retail stores are currently being remodeled to emphasize the brand’s four core types of activitybased apparel — yoga gym running and outdoor adventure approximately 90 of the products in the lucy ® retail stores are lucy ® branded with the balance of the offerings being complementary lines including splendid ® knitwear we expect that substantially all of the products in the stores will continue to be lucy ® branded 

 

we expect to grow the 7 for all mankind ® brand through retail and international expansion and new product lines and the lucy ® brand through opening stores in new markets we will pursue further opportunities to leverage vf’s supply chain capabilities for both brands for future profitability improvement 

 

directtoconsumer operations 

 

vfoperated retail stores are an integral part of our strategy for growing vf’s brands particularly our lifestyle brands our full price retail stores allow us to showcase a brand’s full line of current season products with fixtures 

  and imagery that support the brand’s positioning these stores provide high visibility for our brands and products and enable us to stay close to the needs and preferences of consumers the proper presentation of products in our retail stores also helps to increase consumer purchases of vf products at our wholesale customers vfoperated retail stores generally provide operating margins that are equal to or above vf averages and a return on investment above vf averages in addition vf operates outlet stores in both upscale outlet malls and in more traditional valuebased locations these outlet stores serve an important role in our overall inventory management by allowing vf to effectively sell a significant portion of excess discontinued and outofseason products at better prices than are otherwise available from outside parties while maintaining the integrity of our brands 

 

our growing global retail operations include 698 stores at the end of 2008 of that total there are 624 monobrand stores ie with only one brand’s products offered in each store that sell the north face ®  vans ®  napapijri ®  kipling ®  john varvatos ®  7 for all mankind ®  lucy ®  nautica ®  lee ® or wrangler ® products approximately threefourths of these stores offer products at full price with the remainder being outlet locations offering products at discounted prices in addition to the monobrand retail and outlet stores we operate 74 vf outlet stores across the united states that sell a broad selection of excess quantities of vfbranded products as well as women’s intimate apparel and childrenswear products under brands that are not vfowned approximately threefourths of the vfoperated retail stores are located in the united states the remaining stores are primarily located in europe 

 

across the globe internet sales ie ecommerce comprise a small but growing portion of total retail sales of apparel footwear and accessories ecommerce sales of apparel and footwear have become the second largest category of ecommerce purchases in the united states behind travel purchases at vf ecommerce is a growing portion of our revenues as we currently market the lee ®  the north face ®  vans ®  7 for all mankind ®  lucy ®  nautica ® and kipling ® brands online additional ecommerce sites will be rolled out for consumers in 2009 

 

total retail store and ecommerce sales accounted for 16 of vf’s consolidated total revenues in 2008 and 14 in 2007 we expect our directtoconsumer business to continue to grow at a faster pace than vf’s overall growth rate as we continue opening retail stores for our lifestyle brands during 2008 we opened 89 retail stores for 2009 capital investments of approximately 30 million are planned for leasehold improvements fixtures and equipment for approximately 70 new retail locations 

 

in addition to the directtoconsumer venues operated by vf our licensees distributors and other independent parties operate over 1200 retail stores dedicated to our brands these stores are located primarily in eastern europe and asia 

 

licensing arrangements 

 

as part of our business strategy of expanding market penetration of vfowned brands we enter into licensing agreements for our brands for specific apparel and complementary product categories in identified geographic regions if such arrangements with independent parties can provide more effective manufacturing distribution and marketing of such products than could be achieved internally these licensing arrangements relate to a broad range of vf brands and are for fixed terms of generally five years with conditional renewal options each licensee pays royalties to vf based on its sales of licensed products with most agreements providing for a minimum royalty requirement royalties generally range from 5 to 7 of the licensing partners’ net sales of licensed products gross royalty income was 810 million in 2008 with the largest contribution from the nautica ® brand 

 

in addition licensees of our brands are generally required to spend a specified amount to advertise vf’s products ranging from 1 to 5 of their net licensed product sales in some cases these advertising amounts are remitted to vf for advertising on behalf of the licensees we provide support to these business partners and ensure the integrity of our brand names by taking an active role in the design quality control advertising marketing and distribution of each licensed product 

 

vf has also entered into license agreements to use thirdparty trademarks we market apparel under licenses granted by major league baseball the national football league the national basketball association the national hockey league harleydavidson motor company inc nascar espn inc and major colleges most of which contain minimum annual licensing and advertising requirements 

 

manufacturing sourcing and distribution 

 

product design fit fabric finish and quality are important in all of our businesses these functions are performed by employees located within each of our branded businesses across the globe 

  vf’s centralized global supply chain organization sources product and ultimately bears the responsibility to deliver product to our customers vf is highly skilled in managing the complexity associated with the supply chain vf’s revenues are comprised of approximately 500 million units representing 500000 skus spread over 30 brands vf operates 30 manufacturing facilities and utilizes over 1600 contractor manufacturing facilities we manage over 30 distribution centers and nearly 700 retail stores managing this complexity is made possible by our use of information systems technologies — with bestofbreed systems for product development forecasting order management warehouse management etc attached to our core enterprise resource management platform 

 

today 23 of our global net sales are of products manufactured in vfowned facilities in mexico europe and central america and 77 are of products obtained from contractors primarily in asia we believe a combination of vfowned and contracted production from different geographic regions provides flexibility and a competitive advantage in our product sourcing we will continue to manage our supply chain from a global perspective and adjust as needed to changes in the global production environment 

 

our domestic jeanswear and imagewear businesses operate owned manufacturing facilities primarily cutting sewing and finishing located in mexico and central america our international jeanswear businesses operate manufacturing facilities located in poland and turkey a significant percentage of our denim bottoms are manufactured in these plants for these owned production plants we purchase raw materials from numerous domestic and international suppliers to meet scheduled production needs raw materials include fabrics made from cotton synthetics and blends of cotton and synthetic yarn as well as thread and trim product identification buttons zippers and snaps in some instances we contract the sewing of vfowned raw materials into finished product with independent contractors in the united states mexico and central america while we obtain fixed price commitments for denim and certain supplies for up to one year in advance specific purchase obligations with suppliers are typically limited to the succeeding two to six months our only longterm contract for the purchase of raw materials or finished products is a commitment in connection with the sale of vf’s childrenswear business in 2004 this agreement requires vf to purchase a remaining total of approximately 775 million of finished product for sale through our vf outlet stores with a minimum of 15 million per year no single supplier represents more than approximately 3 of our total cost of sales 

 

for the us market our current sourcing strategy includes a balance of vfowned production and contracted production in the western hemisphere and contracted production from asia owned production generally has a lower cost than contracted production product obtained from contractors in the western hemisphere generally has a higher cost compared with production obtained from contractors in the far east but gives us greater flexibility and shorter lead times and allows for lower inventory levels approximately 33 of units sold in the united states and 27 of the dollar value of domestic net sales in 2008 were manufactured in vfowned facilities primarily in mexico and central america with the balance obtained from contractors primarily in asia this combination of vfowned and contracted production along with different geographic regions and cost structures provides a balanced approach to product sourcing 

 

to an increasing extent we are using independent contractors who own the raw materials and ship only finished readyforsale products to vf these contractors are engaged through vf sourcing hubs in hong kong with several satellite offices across asia and miami these hubs are responsible for product procurement product quality assurance supplier management transportation and shipping functions in the eastern and western hemispheres respectively substantially all products in the outdoor and action sports and sportswear coalitions as well as a growing portion of product requirements for our jeanswear and imagewear coalitions are obtained through these sourcing hubs for most products in our contemporary brands coalition we currently contract the majority of sewing and finishing of vfowned raw materials through a network of independent domestic and international contractors some of this volume is being shifted to the vf sourcing hubs vf does not directly or indirectly source any products from suppliers in countries that are identified by the state department as state sponsors of terrorism and are subject to us economic sanctions and export controls 

 

management continually monitors political risks and developments related to duties tariffs and quotas we limit vf’s sourcing exposure through among other measures i extensive geographic diversification with a mix of vfoperated and contracted production ii shifts of production among countries and contractors iii allocation of production to merchandise categories where the free flow of product is available and iv sourcing from countries with tariff preference and free trade agreements 

  through its contractor monitoring program vf oversees the activities of the many independent businesses and contractors that produce vfbranded goods at locations across the globe each of the over 1600 independent contractor facilities that manufacture vfbranded products must be precertified prior to performance of any production on behalf of vf including contractors of our independent licensees this precertification includes passing a factory inspection and signing a vf terms of engagement agreement these requirements provide strict standards covering age of workers hours of work health and safety conditions and conformity with local laws we maintain an ongoing audit program to ensure compliance with these requirements by using dedicated internal and outsourced staff additional information about vf’s global compliance principles terms of engagement factory audit procedure and factory compliance guidelines along with a global compliance report are available on the vf website at wwwvfccom 

 

vf did not experience difficulty in filling its raw material and contracting production needs during 2008 and we do not anticipate difficulties in meeting our raw materials and contracting production requirements during 2009 the loss of any one supplier or contractor would not have a significant adverse effect on our business 

 

product is shipped from our independent suppliers and vfoperated manufacturing plants to many distribution centers in the united states and international markets in limited instances product is shipped directly to our customers product is inspected sorted and stored in our distribution centers until needed for packing and shipping to our wholesale customers or our retail stores most distribution centers are operated by vf some support multiple brands a small portion of our distribution needs are met by contract distribution centers our distribution centers use computercontrolled inventory management technology for efficient tracking and movement of products 

 

seasonality 

 

with its diversified product offerings vf’s operating results are somewhat seasonal on a quarterly basis and excluding the effect of timing of businesses acquired during 2008 consolidated total revenues for 2008 ranged from a low of approximately 22 of full year revenues in the second quarter to a high of 29 in the third quarter this disparity results primarily from the seasonal influences on revenues of our outdoor and action sports coalition where only 19 of outdoor and action sports coalition revenues occurred in the second quarter and 33 in the third quarter of 2008 with changes in our mix of business along with growth of our retail operations historical quarterly revenue and profit trends may not be indicative of future trends we expect the portion of annual revenues and profits occurring in the second half of the year to increase 

 

working capital requirements vary throughout the year working capital increases during the first half of the year as inventory builds to support peak shipping periods and then decreases during the second half of the year as those inventories are sold and accounts receivable are collected cash provided by operating activities is substantially higher in the second half of the year due to higher net income during that period and reduced working capital requirements particularly during the fourth quarter

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating vf’s business and the forwardlooking statements contained in this form 10k any of the following risks could materially adversely affect vf’s business its operating results and its financial condition 

 

risks specific to vf corporation 

 

vf’s business could be adversely affected by reduced consumer spending and consumer confidence 

 

the global credit crisis that began in 2008 is having a negative impact on retail sales of apparel and other consumer products reduced sales by our wholesale customers may lead to lower retail inventory levels reduced orders from suppliers like vf or order cancelations reduced sales by some of our wholesale customers along with the possibility of their reduced access to or inability to access the credit markets may result in various retailers experiencing significant financial difficulties financial difficulties of customers could result in reduced sales to those customers or could result in store closures bankruptcies or liquidations higher credit risk relating to receivables from customers experiencing financial difficulty may result if these developments occur our inability to shift sales to other customers or to collect on vf’s trade accounts receivable could have a material adverse effect on vf’s financial condition and results of operations 

 

a growing portion of our revenues are directtoconsumer through vfoperated retail stores and websites it is possible that reduced consumer confidence along with a reduction in availability of consumer credit and increasing unemployment may lead to reduced purchases of vf’s products through vfoperated retail stores and websites this could have a material adverse effect on vf’s financial condition and results of operations 

 

a substantial portion of vf’s revenues and gross profit is derived from a small number of large customers the loss of any of these customers could substantially reduce vf’s profits 

 

a few of vf’s customers account for a significant portion of revenues sales to vf’s ten largest customers were 26 of total revenues in fiscal 2008 with walmart stores inc accounting for 11 of revenues sales are generally on a purchase order basis and we do not have longterm agreements with any of our customers a decision by any of vf’s major customers to decrease significantly the number of products purchased from vf could substantially reduce revenues and have a material adverse effect on vf’s financial condition and results of operations moreover in recent years the retail industry has experienced consolidation and other ownership changes in the future retailers may further consolidate undergo restructurings or reorganizations realign their affiliations or reposition their stores’ target market these developments could result in a reduction in the number of stores that carry vf’s products increased ownership concentration within the retail industry increased credit 

  exposure or increased retailer leverage over their suppliers these changes could both impact vf’s opportunities in the market and increase vf’s reliance on a smaller number of large customers 

 

the apparel industry is highly competitive and vf’s success depends on its ability to respond to constantly changing fashion trends and consumer demand reduced sales or prices resulting from competition could have a material adverse effect on vf 

 

vf competes with numerous brands and manufacturers of apparel some of our competitors may be larger and have more resources than vf in certain product categories in addition vf competes directly with the private label brands of its wholesale customers vf’s ability to compete within the apparel and footwear industries depends on its ability to 

 

  

the failure to compete effectively or to keep pace with rapidly changing markets and trends could have a material adverse effect on vf’s business financial condition and results of operations in addition if we misjudge fashion trends and market conditions we could be faced with significant excess inventories for some products that we may have to sell at a loss or missed opportunities that may result in lost sales 

 

vf’s business is exposed to foreign currency fluctuations 

 

approximately 30 of vf’s total revenues is derived from international markets vf’s foreign businesses operate in functional currencies other than the us dollar assets liabilities revenues and expenses in these foreign businesses are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in addition vf sources and manufactures most of its products overseas as a result the cost of these products may be affected by changes in the value of the relevant currencies changes in currency exchange rates may also affect the us dollar value of the foreign currency denominated amounts at which vf’s international businesses purchase products incur costs or sell products furthermore much of vf’s licensing revenue is derived from sales in foreign currencies although we hedge some exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange rates arising in the ordinary course of business foreign currency fluctuations could have a material adverse impact on vf’s financial condition and results of operations 

 

vf’s profitability may decline as a result of increasing pressure on margins 

 

the apparel industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors including intense competition consolidation in the retail industry pressure from retailers to reduce the costs of products and changes in consumer demand these factors may cause us to reduce our sales prices to retailers and consumers which could cause vf’s gross margin to decline if we are unable to offset price reductions with comparable reductions in operating costs if vf’s sales prices decline and we fail to sufficiently reduce our product costs or operating expenses vf’s profitability will decline this could have a material adverse effect on vf’s results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

 

fluctuations in the price availability and quality of raw materials could increase costs and cause service delays 

 

fluctuations in the price availability and quality of fabrics or other raw materials used by vf in its manufactured apparel could have a material adverse effect on vf’s cost of sales or its ability to meet its customers’ demands the prices for such fabrics depend on demand and market prices for the raw materials used to produce them particularly cotton the price and availability of such raw materials may fluctuate significantly depending on many factors including crop yields and weather patterns in the future vf may not be able to pass all or a portion of such higher raw materials prices on to its customers 

  vf has entered into license agreements to use the trademarks of others loss of a license could have an adverse effect on vf’s operating results 

 

vf has entered into agreements to market products under licenses granted by third parties including major league baseball the national football league and harleydavidson motor company inc some of these licenses are for a short term and do not contain renewal options loss of a license which in certain cases could result in an impairment charge for related intangible assets could have an adverse effect on vf’s operating results 

 

vf may not succeed in implementing its growth strategy 

 

one of our key strategic objectives is growth we seek to grow through both organic growth and acquisitions building new growing lifestyle brands expanding our share with winning customers stretching vf’s brands and customers to new geographies fueling the growth by leveraging our supply chain and information technology capabilities across vf expanding our directtoconsumer business and building new growth enablers by identifying and developing high potential employees we may not be able to grow our existing businesses or achieve planned cost savings from ongoing businesses we may have difficulty identifying acquisition targets and we may not be able to successfully integrate a newly acquired business or achieve expected cost savings or synergies from such integration we may not be able to expand our market share with winning customers expand our brands geographically or achieve the expected results from our supply chain initiatives we may also have difficulty recruiting or developing qualified managers failure to implement our growth strategy may have a material adverse effect on vf’s business 

 

vf borrows funds on a shortterm basis primarily to support seasonal working capital requirements longterm debt is part of vf’s total capital structure because of recent conditions in global credit markets vf may have difficulty accessing the capital markets for short or longterm financing 

 

during the last several months the global capital and credit markets have been experiencing extreme levels of volatility and disruption with government intervention mergers or bankruptcies of several major financial institutions and a general decline in global liquidity many corporate issuers have been unable to access credit markets 

 

vf uses shortterm commercial paper borrowings primarily to support seasonal working capital requirements with amounts generally repaid by the end of each year from strong cash flows from operations vf was able to continue to borrow in the commercial paper markets during 2008 and all commercial paper borrowings were repaid by the end of the year in addition vf may access the longterm capital markets to replace maturing debt obligations or to fund acquisition or other growth opportunities there is no assurance that the commercial paper markets or the longterm capital markets will continue to be a reliable source of financing for vf 

 

vf has committed domestic and international bank credit facilities because of the continued distress in the global capital markets one or more of the participating banks may not be able to honor their commitments which could have an adverse effect on vf’s business 

 

if we were to have difficulty in accessing the short or longterm capital markets vf has 13 billion of committed domestic and international bank credit facilities that expire in october 2012 continued distress in the financial markets could impair the ability of one or more of the banks participating in our credit agreements from honoring their commitments this could have an adverse effect on our business if we were not able to replace those commitments or to locate other sources of liquidity on acceptable terms 

 

if vf encounters problems with its distribution system vf’s ability to deliver its products to the market would be adversely affected 

 

vf relies on its distribution facilities to warehouse and using its own employees or in some cases independent contractors to ship product to its customers vf’s distribution system includes computercontrolled and automated equipment which means its operations are complicated and may be subject to a number of risks related to security or computer viruses the proper operation of software and hardware electronic or power interruptions or other system failures because substantially all of vf’s products are distributed from a relatively small number of locations vf’s operations could also be interrupted by earthquakes floods fires or other natural disasters near its distribution centers we maintain business interruption insurance but it may not adequately protect vf from the adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in vf’s distribution facilities such as the longterm loss of customers or an erosion of brand image in addition vf’s distribution capacity is dependent on the timely performance of services by third parties including the transportation of product to and from its distribution 

  facilities if we encounter problems with our distribution system our ability to meet customer expectations manage inventory complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies could be materially adversely affected 

 

vf relies significantly on information technology any inadequacy interruption integration failure or security failure of that technology could harm vf’s ability to effectively operate its business 

 

our ability to effectively manage and operate our business depends significantly on its information technology systems the failure of these systems to operate effectively problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems difficulty in integrating new systems or systems of acquired businesses or a breach in security of these systems could adversely impact the operations of vf’s business moreover vf and its customers could suffer harm if customer information were accessed by third parties due to a security failure in vf’s systems it could also require significant expenditures to remediate any such failure problem or breach 

 

vf uses foreign suppliers and manufacturing facilities for a substantial portion of its raw materials and finished products which poses risks to vf’s business operations 

 

during fiscal 2008 approximately 77 of vf’s products sold were produced by and purchased or procured from independent manufacturers primarily located in asia with substantially all of the remainder produced by vfowned and operated manufacturing facilities located in eastern europe mexico and central america although no single supplier and no one country is critical to vf’s production needs any of the following could materially and adversely affect our ability to produce or deliver vf products and as a result have a material adverse effect on vf’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

  

if vf’s suppliers fail to use acceptable ethical business practices vf’s business could suffer 

 

we require third party suppliers to operate in compliance with applicable laws rules and regulations regarding working conditions employment practices and environmental compliance additionally we require all suppliers making vfbranded apparel whether directly for vf or for its licensees to comply with vf’s terms of engagement and global compliance principles our staff and third parties retained for such purposes periodically visit and audit the operations of vf’s owned and operated facilities and those of independent contractors manufacturing product for vf to determine compliance however we do not control independent manufacturers or their labor and other business practices if one of our independent contractors violates labor or other laws or implements labor or other business practices that are generally regarded as unethical in the united states the shipment of finished products to vf could be interrupted orders could be cancelled relationships could be terminated and vf’s reputation could be damaged any of these events could have a material adverse effect on vf’s revenues and consequently its results of operations 

 

vf’s results of operations could be materially harmed if vf is unable to accurately forecast demand for its products 

 

we often schedule internal production and place orders for products with independent manufacturers before our customers’ orders are firm therefore if we fail to accurately forecast customer demand we may experience 

  excess inventory levels or a shortage of product to deliver to our customers factors that could affect our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products include 

 

  

inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory writedowns and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices which could have an adverse effect on vf’s results of operations and financial condition in addition if we underestimate demand for our products our manufacturing facilities or third party manufacturers may not be able to produce products to meet customer requirements and this could result in delays in the shipment of products and lost revenues as well as damage to vf’s reputation and customer relationships there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully manage inventory demand to meet future order and reorder requirements 

 

the loss of members of vf’s executive management and other key employees could have a material adverse effect on its business 

 

vf depends on the services and management experience of its executive officers and business leaders who have substantial experience and expertise in vf’s business vf also depends on other key employees involved in the operation of its business competition for qualified personnel in the apparel industry is intense the unexpected loss of services of one or more of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on vf 

 

vf may be unable to protect its trademarks and other intellectual property rights 

 

vf’s trademarks and other intellectual property rights are important to its success and its competitive position vf is susceptible to others imitating its products and infringing its intellectual property rights with the shift in product mix to higher priced brands vf is more susceptible to infringement of its intellectual property rights some of vf’s brands such as the north face ®  vans ®  jansport ®  nautica ®  wrangler ® and lee ® brands enjoy significant worldwide consumer recognition and the generally higher pricing of such products creates additional risk of counterfeiting and infringement 

 

infringement or counterfeiting of vf’s products or its other intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our brands or otherwise adversely affect vf revenues actions we have taken to establish and protect vf’s intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of its products by others or to prevent others from seeking to invalidate its trademarks or block sales of vf’s products as a violation of the trademarks and intellectual property rights of others in addition unilateral actions in the united states or other countries such as changes to or the repeal of laws recognizing trademark or other intellectual property rights could have an impact on vf’s ability to enforce those rights 

 

the value of vf’s intellectual property could diminish if others assert rights in or ownership of trademarks and other intellectual property rights of vf or in trademarks that are similar to vf’s trademarks or trademarks that vf licenses andor markets we may be unable to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction in some cases there may be trademark owners who have prior rights to vf’s trademarks because the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states in other cases there may be holders who have prior rights to similar trademarks vf is from time to time involved in opposition and cancelation proceedings with respect to some items of its intellectual property 

 

vf obtains licensing royalties and relies on its licensees to maintain the value of its brands 

 

only a relatively small portion of vf’s revenues 810 million or 11 was derived from licensing royalties in 2008 although vf generally has significant control over its licensee products and advertising we rely on them for among other things operational and financial controls over their businesses failure of our licensees to successfully market licensed products or our inability to replace existing licensees could adversely affect vf’s revenues both 

  directly from reduced royalties received and indirectly from reduced sales of our other products risks are also associated with a licensee’s ability to 

 

  

in addition vf relies on its licensees to help preserve the value of its brands although we make every attempt to protect vf’s brands through among other things approval rights over design production processes and quality packaging merchandising distribution advertising and promotion of its products we cannot completely control the use of licensed vf brands by our licensees the misuse of a brand by a licensee could have a material adverse effect on that brand and on vf 

 

vf’s balance sheet includes a significant amount of intangible assets and goodwill a decline in the estimated fair value of an intangible asset or of a business unit could result in an asset impairment charge which would be recorded as an operating expense in vf’s consolidated statement of income 

 

under current accounting standards we estimate the fair value of acquired assets including intangible assets and assumed liabilities arising from a business acquisition the excess if any of the cost of the acquired business over the fair value of net tangible assets acquired is goodwill the goodwill is then assigned to a business unit or “reporting unit” within vf which depends on whether the acquired business will be operated as a separate business unit or integrated into an existing vf business unit 

 

at december 2008 vf had approximately 09 billion of trademark intangible assets and 13 billion of goodwill on its balance sheet these assets are not required to be amortized under current accounting rules in addition vf had approximately 04 billion of intangible assets that are being amortized under current accounting rules the combined amounts represent 42 of vf’s total assets and 75 of common stockholders’ equity 

 

trademark intangible assets that are not amortized and goodwill must be tested for impairment at least annually the impairment test requires us to estimate the fair value of vf’s business units and related intangible assets primarily using discounted cash flow methodologies based on forecasted revenues and cash flows that will be derived from a business unit or trademark intangible assets that are being amortized must be tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value might not be recoverable 

 

the fair value of a business unit could decline if forecasted revenues or cash flows were to be lower in the future due to effects of the global recession or other causes if the carrying value of intangible assets or of goodwill were to exceed its fair value the asset would be written down to its fair value with the impairment loss recognized as a noncash charge in the consolidated statement of income we have not had any impairment charges in the last three years other than the 2006 loss on disposal of our intimate apparel business accounted for as discontinued operations however changes in the future outlook of a business unit could result in an impairment loss which could have a material adverse effect on vf’s results of operations and financial condition 

 

vf’s defined benefit pension plans were underfunded at the end of 2008 due primarily to the effects of the global financial and credit market crisis that began in 2008 this resulted in a charge to common stockholders’ equity in our consolidated balance sheet and a significant increase in our 2009 pension expense if the pension plan investments were to decline in value or if the level of interest rates were to decline from the current level the pension plans would be further underfunded resulting in an additional charge to common stockholders’ equity and higher pension expense in future years 

 

vf’s qualified defined benefit pension plan swung from being overfunded at the end of 2007 to significantly underfunded at the end of 2008 this underfunded status was due primarily to the decline in the value of pension plan assets with the general turmoil in the global securities markets in 2008 the underfunded status resulted in recognition of 4149 million of liabilities and a 2910 million aftertax charge to common stockholders’ equity at the end of 2008 for financial accounting differences between actual investment returns and the actuarially assumed investment return are deferred and amortized to future years’ pension cost our pension cost will increase from 108 million in 2008 to approximately 98 million in 2009 primarily due to amortization of these deferred actuarial losses 

  the level of interest rates drives the discount rate used to value the plans’ projected benefit obligations in general a decrease in interest rates would result in a greater present value of future benefit obligations while an increase in interest rates would result in a smaller present value of future benefit obligations 

 

a further decrease in the value of pension plan assets or a decrease in interest rates could result in a further decline in the plans’ funded status in that case vf would recognize additional liabilities and additional charges to common stockholders’ equity in our consolidated balance sheet and higher pension expense in future years 

 

if current market conditions persist vf would be required to make substantial cash funding contributions to the plan beginning in 2010 to return the plan to a fully funded status over the next few years 

 

risks applicable to the apparel industry 

 

vf’s revenues and profits depend on the level of consumer spending for apparel which is sensitive to general economic conditions and other factors affecting consumer confidence 

 

the apparel industry has historically been subject to cyclical variations and is particularly affected by adverse trends in the general economy the success of vf’s business depends on consumer spending consumer spending is influenced by a number of factors including actual and perceived economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as unemployment and wages business conditions interest rates housing costs energy prices availability of credit and tax rates in the international national regional and local markets where vf’s products are sold any significant deterioration in general economic conditions recession or increases in interest rates could reduce the level of consumer spending and inhibit consumers’ use of credit a significant decline in the securities markets could materially affect consumer confidence the financial condition of vf’s customers and vf’s operating costs through higher contributions to its pension plan in addition natural disasters war terrorist activity or the threat of war or terrorist activity could adversely affect consumer spending and thereby have a material adverse effect on vf’s financial condition and results of operations 

 

vf’s ability to sell products in international markets may be affected by legal regulatory political and economic risks 

 

our ability to maintain the current level of operations in our existing international markets and to capitalize on growth in new international markets is subject to risks associated with international operations these include the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws and regulations unexpected changes in regulatory requirements new tariffs or other barriers to some international markets 

 

we cannot predict whether quotas duties taxes or other similar restrictions will be imposed by the united states the european union or other countries upon the import or export of our products in the future or what effect any of these actions would have on vf’s business financial condition or results of operations changes in regulatory geopolitical policies and other factors may adversely affect vf’s business or may require us to modify our current business practices

discontinued operations 

 

vf sold its women’s intimate apparel business in april 2007 the decision to exit this business was representative of our strategic plan to shift vf’s portfolio mix to higher growth higher margin lifestyle brands because vf has sold this business the operating results assets liabilities and cash flows of the global intimate apparel business have been separately presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements 

 

see note c to the consolidated financial statements for further details about the discontinued operations unless otherwise stated the remaining sections of this discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition relate only to continuing operations 

 

impact of the current global economic environment 

 

the global economy reflected significant volatility and change during 2008 — declines in residential and commercial real estate values that spread across the globe rapid and extreme changes in commodity prices and currency markets sharp declines in global securities markets rising unemployment and a credit and liquidity crisis — leading to the current global recession vf reported record revenues and earnings per share in each of its first three quarters and full year of 2008 however our fourth quarter performance was negatively impacted by the deteriorating global economic environment and its impact on consumer spending there is every indication that these difficult economic conditions will continue through 2009 

  in response to these market conditions and the expectation that they would continue we took an aggressive approach to reducing costs resulting in a charge of 410 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 these cost reduction initiatives are expected to result in cost savings of approximately 100 million beginning in 2009 see note k to the consolidated financial statements 

 

longterm financial targets 

 

in january 2008 we revised two of our longterm financial targets and added a new earnings per share growth target we expect attainment of these targets to drive increases in total shareholder return “tsr” which is the total of stock price appreciation and dividends received by our shareholders while the revenue and earnings growth targets are not expected to be achieved in 2009 we have not revised our longerterm outlook these targets are summarized below 

 

  

in addition to the revised and new targets discussed above we maintained the following longterm targets 

 

  

income from continuing operations before net interest expense after income taxes average common stockholders’ equity plus average short and longterm debt 

 

vf earned a 135 return on invested capital in 2008 and a 148 return in 2007 our returns in these years were impacted by our 2008 cost reduction initiatives and by acquisitions in 2007 newly acquired businesses generally have a lower than average return on invested capital in their earliest years of ownership 

 

 26 

   

  

we evaluate our existing businesses to ensure that they meet our strategic and financial objectives and may in the future decide to exit a business that does not meet those objectives as demonstrated by the sale of the global intimate apparel business in 2007 

 

strategic objectives 

 

we have developed a growth plan that we believe will enable vf to achieve its longterm revenue and earnings targets our growth strategy consists of six drivers 

 

  

highlights of 2008 

 

there were several notable actions and achievements in 2008

analysis of results of continuing operations 

 

consolidated statements of income 

 

the following table presents a summary of the changes in our total revenues during the last two years 

 

 

 

total revenues consist of net sales of products and royalty income from licensees revenues increased in 2008 due to overall unit volume increases and organic growth in our outdoor and action sports businesses and the benefit of a full year of operations of our contemporary brands businesses acquired in 2007 the impact of the 53rd week in 2008 was not significant to vf’s operating results revenues in most of our businesses increased in 2007 with the largest growth in our outdoor and action sports and jeanswear businesses additional details on revenues are provided in the section titled “information by business segment” 

 

in translating foreign currencies into the us dollar the weaker us dollar in relation to the functional currencies where vf conducts the majority of its business primarily the european euro countries benefited revenue by 109 million in 2008 relative to 2007 and 130 million in 2007 relative to 2006 the weighted average translation rate for the euro was 147 per euro during 2008 compared with 136 during 2007 with the strengthening of the us dollar in recent months to 139 per euro at december 2008 reported revenues in 2009 are expected to be negatively impacted compared with 2008 

 

the following table presents the percentage relationship to total revenues for components of our consolidated statements of income 

 

 

 

gross margins increased to 439 of revenues in 2008 compared with 435 in 2007 and 434 in 2006 gross margins increased 05 in 2008 from the impact of our lifestyle businesses which have gross margin percentages higher than vf averages representing a higher percentage of total revenues the slight increase in the gross margin percentage in 2007 over 2006 was also due to our higher margin lifestyle businesses representing a higher percentage of total revenues 

 

in 2008 77 of our total net sales related to products sourced from contractors primarily in asia and 23 related to products manufactured in vfowned facilities in mexico europe and central and south america we believe a combination of vfowned and contracted production from different geographic regions provides flexibility and a competitive advantage in our product sourcing 

 

marketing administrative and general expenses as a percent of revenues were 317 of revenues in 2008 and 301 in both 2007 and 2006 this ratio increased 14 in 2008 due to the growth in our directtoconsumer business which has a higher expense ratio our directtoconsumer business represented 16 of total vf revenues in 2008 and 14 in 2007 in addition the specific cost reduction actions discussed in the “highlights of 2008” section of the “overview” above increased this ratio by 06 in 2008 these increases were partially offset by lower incentive compensation and other spending reductions while the 2007 ratio was flat compared with 2006 the 2007 ratio reflected the net impact of the higher expense ratios of our 2007 acquisitions and the cost reduction actions taken in 2007 offset by the beneficial impact of revenue growth in many of our businesses resulting in improved leverage of operating expenses 

  we include costs of cooperative advertising licensing retail stores and shipping and handling in marketing administrative and general expenses as stated in our significant accounting policies in note a to the consolidated financial statements some apparel companies classify cooperative advertising costs as a reduction of net sales and licensing costs as a reduction to royalty income further some classify retail store costs and shipping and handling costs in cost of goods sold accordingly our gross margins and operating expenses may not be directly comparable with other apparel companies 

 

interest income decreased 32 million in 2008 primarily due to lower interest rates interest expense including bank fees and amortization of deferred costs and a hedging gain increased 219 million in 2008 due to an increase in debt balances related to the issuance of 6000 million of senior longterm notes in october 2007 to fund our 2007 acquisitions this increase was partially offset by lower shortterm borrowing rates interest expense increased 149 million in 2007 due to i higher borrowings needed to fund acquisition activity and ii higher interest rates on shortterm debt average interestbearing debt outstanding totaled approximately 1454 million for 2008 1080 million for 2007 and 900 million for 2006 the weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt was 63 for 2008 64 for 2007 and 61 for 2006 

 

the effective income tax rate was 289 in 2008 compared with 323 in 2007 and 312 in 2006 during 2008 2007 and 2006 we recorded tax benefits of 246 million 120 million and 169 million respectively for the favorable tax outcomes upon audits in several international locations and from expirations of statutes of limitations in locations where tax contingencies were recorded for open tax years these benefits lowered our annual tax rates by 29 13 and 22 respectively for 2008 2007 and 2006 during 2008 we also recorded tax benefits of 115 million due to updated assessments of previously accrued amounts these benefits lowered our 2008 annual tax rate by 14 the remainder of the decline in the effective income tax rate in 2008 from 2007 was attributed to growth in our international businesses in jurisdictions having effective tax rates that are substantially lower than the united states as well as vf average effective rates 

 

income from continuing operations decreased 2 to 6027 million in 2008 from 6132 million in 2007 while earnings per share increased to 542 in 2008 from 541 in 2007 cost reduction actions taken during 2008 lowered earnings per share by 041 cost reduction actions completed in 2007 partially offset by the gain on exiting the his ® business reduced 2007 earnings per share by 006 in translating foreign currencies into the us dollar the weaker us dollar had a 015 favorable impact on earnings per share in 2008 compared with 2007 discrete tax items accounted for an incremental benefit of 016 in 2008 earnings per share over 2007 earnings per share increased slightly in 2008 on lower income from continuing operations due to the reduced number of diluted shares outstanding in 2008 

 

after considering the effects of discontinued operations vf reported net income of 5916 million 522 per share in 2007 and 5335 million 472 per share in 2006 in translating foreign currencies into the us dollar the weaker us dollar had a 011 per share favorable impact in 2007 compared with 2006 net income for 2007 also benefited by 009 per share from the acquisitions made in 2007 

 

information by business segment 

 

vf’s businesses are grouped into five product categories and by brands within those product categories for management and internal financial reporting purposes these groupings of businesses are referred to as “coalitions” both management and vf’s board of directors evaluate operating performance at the coalition level these coalitions represent vf’s reportable segments 

 

we have recently realigned our management structure within our former outdoor coalition to better capture future opportunities in the outdoor and action sports industries as a result we have renamed that coalition the outdoor and action sports coalition 

 

for business segment reporting purposes coalition revenues and coalition profit represent net sales royalty income and operating expenses under the direct control of an individual coalition along with amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets and its share of centralized corporate expenses directly related to the coalition corporate expenses not apportioned to the coalitions and net interest expense are excluded from coalition profit importantly this basis of performance evaluation is consistent with that used for management incentive compensation 

 

see note r to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of our results of operations and other information by coalition along with a reconciliation of coalition profit to income from continuing operations 

  before income taxes to leverage the scale of vf there are a number of functions that are shared across all coalitions accordingly coalition results are not necessarily indicative of operating results that would have been reported had each business coalition been an independent standalone entity during the periods presented further vf’s presentation of coalition profit may not be comparable with similar measures used by other companies 

 

the following table presents a summary of the changes in our total revenues by coalition during the last two years 

 

 

 

outdoor and action sports 

 

the outdoor and action sports coalition consists of vf’s outdoor and action sportsrelated businesses including the north face ® brand apparel footwear and equipment vans ® performance and casual footwear and apparel jansport ® and eastpak ® daypacks and apparel kipling ® bags and accessories napapijri ® outdoorbased sportswear reef ® beachinspired footwear and apparel and eagle creek ® adventure travel gear 

 

outdoor and action sports coalition revenues increased 15 in 2008 led by global unit gains from strong consumer demand for our the north face ®  vans ®  kipling ®  napapijri ® and eastpak ® brands the growth in these brands particularly the north face ® and vans ®  included geographic expansion and the opening of additional owned retail locations domestic revenues for our outdoor and action sports businesses increased 11 while international revenues increased 21 with the favorable effects of foreign currency accounting for 57 million or 6 of this increase 

 

revenues increased 28 in 2007 with 25 organic growth and the remainder resulting from the eagle creek and the north face — china acquisitions in 2007 the organic growth was led by global unit volume increases in our the north face ®  vans ®  kipling ® and napapijri ® brands domestic revenues for our outdoor and action sports businesses increased 24 in 2007 while international revenues increased 35 with the favorable effects of foreign currency accounting for 73 million or 11 of this increase 

 

coalition profit increased 16 in 2008 with operating margins increasing to 166 from 164 in 2007 the increase was driven by higher revenues resulting in improved leverage of operating expenses and growth in our international and retail operations where operating margins are higher these improvements were partially offset by an 83 million charge related to cost reduction actions that negatively impacted operating margins by 03 

 

coalition profit increased 31 in 2007 with operating margins increasing to 164 in 2007 from 160 in 2006 the increase was also driven by strong revenue growth and the improved leverage of operating expenses and higher revenues in our international and retail operations these improvements were partially offset by the negative impact of higher levels of distressed sales and additional investments in our retail operations 

 

jeanswear 

 

the jeanswear coalition consists of our global jeanswear businesses led by the wrangler ® and lee ® brands overall jeanswear revenues were down 5 in 2008 and up 4 in 2007 

 

domestic jeanswear revenues decreased 8 in 2008 and were flat in 2007 compared with 2006 the decline in 2008 resulted from a very difficult retail environment caused by the deteriorating global economy that impacted the 

  lee mass market and western specialty businesses in 2007 a 3 increase in our mass market business over 2006 was offset by slight declines in our lee and specialty businesses 

 

jeanswear revenues in international markets including europe canada mexico latin america and asia increased 2 in 2008 over 2007 and 13 in 2007 over 2006 foreign currency translation positively impacted international jeanswear 2008 revenues by 50 million or 5 and 2007 revenues by 57 million or 6 revenues on a constantcurrency basis were down in 2008 reflecting difficult economic conditions in key european countries and the sale of the his ® business in 2007 which accounted for 25 million of revenues in that year these declines were partially offset by revenue growth in our asia businesses revenues increased in all geographic areas in 2007 over 2006 with the exception of our latin america operations where revenues were flat 

 

jeanswear coalition operating margins were 137 in 2008 and 166 in 2007 jeanswear operating results included expenses of 273 million in 2008 and 80 million in 2007 related to capacity reduction and other cost saving actions which negatively impacted operating margins in those years by 10 and 03 respectively operating margins in 2008 were also impacted by lower revenues without comparable expense reduction increased promotional activities and higher product costs the 2007 operating margin was favorably impacted by 02 related to the gain on the sale of his ® trademarks and related intellectual property during that year 

 

jeanswear coalition operating margins were 166 in 2007 and 155 in 2006 the increase in 2007 operating margins resulted from i growth in our international jeans businesses where gross margins are higher than our domestic businesses ii improved operating efficiencies iii a 02 increase in 2007 due to the gain on the his ® sale and iv capacity and other cost reduction actions that negatively impacted margins by 03 in 2007 vs 05 in 2006 

 

imagewear 

 

the imagewear coalition includes vf’s occupational industrial career and safety apparel business as well as our licensed sports apparel business imagewear coalition revenues were flat in both our occupational and licensed sports apparel businesses in 2008 compared with 2007 imagewear coalition revenues increased in 2007 compared with 2006 due to the majestic acquisition 

 

occupational apparel revenues declined 3 in 2007 from 2006 this reduction included the impact of exiting our underperforming commodity fleece and tshirt business excluding this business revenues in our occupational apparel business increased slightly in 2007 over 2006 

 

revenues in the licensed apparel business increased 59 in 2007 over 2006 due to the acquisition of majestic this acquisition added 156 million to revenues in 2007 excluding the impact of the majestic acquisition licensed apparel revenues increased 6 in 2007 led by growth in the licensed national football league and major league baseball businesses 

 

imagewear coalition operating margins declined in 2008 to 133 from 144 in 2007 reflecting difficult market conditions in the fourth quarter of 2008 that especially affected consumer spending in our licensed sports apparel businesses in addition the 2008 operating results included a 20 million charge for cost reduction activities that negatively impacted the operating margin by 02 and additional investments in advertising that accounted for 04 of the margin decline 

 

operating margins for the imagewear coalition declined to 144 in 2007 from 162 in 2006 resulting from competitive factors impacting the pricing of new programs within the occupational apparel businesses and the impact of the 2007 majestic acquisition which had lower operating margins than imagewear coalition averages 

 

sportswear 

 

the sportswear coalition consists of our nautica ® lifestyle brand the john varvatos ® luxury collection for men and the kipling ® brand business in north america whereas the kipling ® brand is managed as part of the outdoor and action sports coalition internationally 

 

coalition revenues were down 7 in 2008 compared with 2007 with an 11 decrease in our nautica ® brand revenues partially offset by doubledigit revenue gains in our john varvatos ® and kipling ® brand businesses the decline in the nautica business resulted from difficult market conditions in the department store channel lower volumes in our retail outlet stores and the exit in early 2008 of our women’s wholesale business 

 

coalition revenues were flat in 2007 compared with 2006 with a 4 decrease in our nautica ® brand revenues offset by doubledigit revenue gains in our john varvatos ® and kipling ® brand businesses the overall decline in 

  nautica revenues resulted from lower menswear business due to challenging conditions in department stores and higher promotional activity in our nautica retail stores in the second half of 2007 

 

sportswear coalition operating margins declined to 63 in 2008 from 96 in 2007 due to lower nautica ® brand revenues without comparable expense reduction and increased markdown activity related to a highly promotional retail environment in addition the 2008 operating results included 58 million in charges for cost reduction activities including the exit of the nautica ® women’s wholesale sportswear business that negatively impacted the operating margin by 09 

 

sportswear coalition operating margins declined to 96 in 2007 from 133 in 2006 due to the impact of revenue decreases in the nautica ® brand without comparable expense reduction and increased promotional activity in our owned outlet stores and the department store channel in 2007 

 

contemporary brands 

 

this coalition was formed in august 2007 with two newly acquired businesses — seven for all mankind  7 for all mankind ® brand of premium denim jeanswear and related apparel and lucy activewear  lucy ® brand of women’s activewear this coalition in 2008 also includes the earnings since june 2008 from our onethird equity investment in mo industries the owner and marketer of the splendid ® and ella moss ® brands vf expects to acquire the remaining twothirds equity interest in mo industries in the first half of 2009 

 

the increase in coalition revenues in 2008 was due to a full year of ownership of the 7 for all mankind ® and lucy ® brands and additional vfoperated retail store openings 

 

the contemporary brands coalition operating margin decreased from 175 in 2007 to 139 in 2008 reflecting high levels of promotion and markdownrelated expenses as a result of the significant impact of the economic downturn on the more upscale department stores in addition the 2008 operating results included the impact of 17 for charges for an unremitted valueadded tax and duty matter and cost reduction initiatives 

 

other 

 

the other business segment includes the vf outlet business which is a group of companyoperated retail outlet stores in the united states that sell a broad selection of excess quantities of vf products and other branded products revenues and profits of vf products are reported as part of the operating results of the applicable coalitions while revenues and profits of nonvf products primarily women’s intimate apparel childrenswear hosiery underwear and accessories which provide a broader selection of merchandise to attract consumer traffic are reported in this business segment revenues in 2008 for the other business segment were flat with 2007 the increase in revenues in 2007 over 2006 was due to vf outlets’ sales of women’s intimate apparel products obtained from independent suppliers following vf’s exit of its intimate apparel business in april 2007 whereas such revenues prior to april 2007 were reported as part of discontinued operations 

 

reconciliation of coalition profit to consolidated income from continuing operations before income taxes 

 

there are two types of costs necessary to reconcile total coalition profit as discussed in the preceding paragraphs to income from continuing operations before income taxes these costs discussed below are interest and corporate and other expenses see also note r to the consolidated financial statements 

 

interest expense net was discussed in the previous “consolidated statements of income” section interest is excluded from coalition profit because substantially all of our financing costs are managed at the corporate office and are not under the control of coalition management 

  corporate and other expenses consists of corporate headquarters’ and similar costs that are not apportioned to the operating coalitions these expenses are summarized as follows 

 

 

 

information systems and shared services  — included are costs of our management information systems and our centralized shared services center which includes common financial supply chain human resources and customer management services that support our worldwide operations operating costs of information systems and shared services are charged to the coalitions based on utilization of those services such as minutes of computer processing time number of transactions or number of users costs to develop new computer applications that will be used across vf are not allocated to the coalitions the decrease in information systems and shared services costs in 2008 resulted primarily from information systems costs incurred in 2007 for transition services provided to the acquirer of our intimate apparel business that did not recur in 2008 the reimbursement of these costs from the acquirer in 2007 is separately presented above 

 

corporate headquarters’ costs  — headquarters’ costs include compensation and benefits of corporate management and staff certain legal and professional fees and administrative and general expenses which are not apportioned to the coalitions the decrease in corporate headquarters’ costs in 2008 from 2007 resulted primarily from lower management incentive compensation the increase in these costs from 2006 to 2007 was driven by higher incentive compensation and other costs 

 

trademark maintenance and enforcement  — legal and other costs of registering maintaining and enforcing the majority of vf’s trademarks plus related costs of licensing administration are controlled by a centralized trademark and licensing staff and are not allocated to the coalitions 

 

other  — this category includes i adjustments to convert the earnings of certain business units using the fifo inventory valuation method for internal reporting to the lifo method for consolidated financial reporting ii miscellaneous costs that result from corporate programs or corporatemanaged decisions that are not allocated to the business units for internal management reporting and iii other consolidating adjustments 

 

analysis of financial condition 

 

balance sheets 

 

accounts receivable decreased 12 in 2008 due in part to a 5 decrease in fourth quarter wholesale revenues compared with 2007 in addition collections on accounts receivable were higher in 2008 because that year included 53 weeks that is collections in the 53rd week ended january 3 2009 sharply exceeded credit sales during that week 

 

inventories increased 1 in 2008 reflecting our aggressive management of inventory levels during the economic downturn 

 

other current assets increased at december 2008 over 2007 due primarily to an increase in prepaid income taxes at the end of 2008 

 

property plant and equipment remained flat at the end of 2008 compared with 2007 with additions from 2008 capital spending being offset by depreciation and the effects of foreign currency translation capital spending in 2008 supported the growth of our businesses and specifically included an increased level of spending to support new retail stores 

  total intangible assets and goodwill decreased in 2008 due to the amortization of intangible assets and the impact of a stronger us dollar in translating balances of international businesses partially offset by the acquired lee spain balances 

 

other assets increased in 2008 as a result of our investment in mo industries and higher deferred income taxes the increase in deferred income taxes primarily related to the underfunded status of our defined benefit pension plans as discussed below these increases were partially offset by a decline in the value of our assets held for deferred compensation plans 

 

in october 2007 vf entered into a 10 billion domestic senior unsecured committed revolving bank credit agreement that supports issuance of up to 10 billion in commercial paper also in october 2007 certain international subsidiaries with vf as guarantor entered into a €2500 million us dollar equivalent of 3472 million senior unsecured committed revolving bank credit agreement there were no shortterm borrowings under these domestic or international credit agreements at december 2008 shortterm borrowings at december 2007 included 927 million outstanding under the international credit agreement shortterm borrowings under other international borrowing agreements were 536 million at december 2008 and 388 million at december 2007 

 

accounts payable decreased in 2008 compared with 2007 due to the timing of inventory purchases and the related vendor payments at our fiscal yearend accrued liabilities increased in 2008 due to the fourth quarter 2008 charge for cost reduction actions and increased income and other tax accruals partially offset by lower incentive compensation liabilities 

 

other liabilities increased due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit pension plans at the end of 2008 as discussed in the following paragraph this increase is partially offset by lower deferred compensation liabilities and deferred income taxes 

 

the global credit crisis and the related significant declines in global securities markets during 2008 resulted in a significant decline in the value of our defined benefit pension plan’s investment portfolio as a result our projected pension benefit obligations now exceed the value of our plan’s investment assets in accordance with fasb statement no 158 employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans the underfunded status of our pension plans was recognized as a 4149 million liability at december 2008 and a 2910 million aftertax charge in accumulated other comprehensive income loss net deferred actuarial losses in accumulated other comprehensive income loss will be amortized to pension expense over the next five years see note n to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of asset liability and equity balances related to defined benefit pension plans 

 

liquidity and cash flows 

 

the financial condition of vf is reflected in the following 

 

 

 

for the ratio of debt to total capital debt is defined as shortterm and longterm borrowings and total capital is defined as debt plus common stockholders’ equity our ratio of net debt to total capital with net debt defined as debt less cash and equivalents was 187 at the end of 2008 

 

vf’s primary source of liquidity is its strong cash flow provided by operating activities cash flow from operating activities of continuing operations which was 6795 million in 2008 8336 million in 2007 and 4541 million in 2006 is primarily dependent on the level of income from continuing operations and changes in investments in inventories and other working capital components income from continuing operations was 6027 million 6132 million and 5351 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively income from continuing operations in each year included noncash stockbased compensation expense of 316 million 624 million and 464 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively also we did not make a discretionary contribution to our qualified defined benefit pension plan in 2007 or 2008 because of the plan’s funded status at the beginning of each of those years operating cash flows in 2006 included a discretionary contribution to the pension plan of 750 million 

  the net change in operating asset and liability components was a cash usage of 1523 million in 2008 42 million in 2007 and 2006 million in 2006 cash flow in 2008 benefited from collections on accounts receivable in the 53rd week of the year that is collections in the 53rd week ended january 3 2009 sharply exceeded credit sales during that week cash flow in 2007 benefited because the timing of yearend payments resulted in an unusually large accounts payable balance at the end of 2007 which resulted in higher accounts payable disbursements in 2008 cash generated from operations was lower in 2006 due to i higher than normal accounts receivable at the end of 2006 resulting from very strong international sales near the end of the year to customers with longer payment terms ii unusually low accounts payable at the end of 2006 due to the timing of inventory receipts and iii unusually high accrued income taxes at the beginning of 2006 due to required tax payments for the prior year 

 

to finance ongoing operations and most unusual circumstances that may arise vf anticipates relying on continued future strong cash generation in addition vf has significant existing liquidity from its available cash balances and debt capacity supported by its strong credit rating at the end of 2008 9884 million was available for borrowing under vf’s 10 billion senior unsecured committed revolving bank credit facility with 116 million of standby letters of credit issued under the agreement this credit facility is used primarily to support our seasonal commercial paper borrowings also at the end of 2008 €2500 million us dollar equivalent of 3472 million was available for borrowing under vf’s senior unsecured committed international revolving bank credit facility 

 

as discussed in the previous balance sheets section our defined benefit pension plans were significantly underfunded at the end of 2008 vf is not required and does not intend to make a funding contribution to the plan during 2009 vf has adequate liquidity to meet future funding requirements we will continue to evaluate the funded status of our retirement plans and to evaluate future funding levels 

 

we paid cash of 934 million 10606 million and 393 million for acquisitions in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively net of cash balances in the acquired companies these acquisitions were funded with existing vf cash balances shortterm commercial paper borrowings and bank borrowings in addition we received 3487 million in proceeds from the sale of our intimate apparel business in 2007 

 

capital expenditures were 1242 million in 2008 compared with 1139 million and 1272 million in 2007 and 2006 respectively capital expenditures in each of these years primarily related to retail distribution and information systems as well as maintenance spending across our global manufacturing network we expect that capital spending could reach 110 million in 2009 capital spending will be funded by cash flow from operations 

 

during 2007 vf received 5928 million in proceeds from the issuance of 6000 million principal amount of 595 senior notes due in 2017 and 645 senior notes due in 2037 vf paid 781 million under the international bank credit agreement in 2007 and paid 330 million notes in each of 2007 and 2006 related to the nautica acquisition see notes j and l to the consolidated financial statements 

 

in october 2007 standard  poor’s ratings services affirmed its ‘a minus’ corporate credit rating ‘a2’ commercial paper rating and ‘stable’ outlook for vf standard  poor’s also assigned its ‘a minus’ senior unsecured debt rating to vf’s 6000 million unsecured senior notes issued in october 2007 in august 2007 moody’s investors service affirmed vf’s longterm debt rating of ‘a3’ commercial paper rating of ’prime2’ and ‘stable’ outlook existing longterm debt agreements do not contain acceleration of maturity clauses based solely on changes in credit ratings however for the 6000 million of senior notes issued in 2007 if there were a change in control of vf and as a result of the change in control  the notes were rated below investment grade by recognized rating agencies then vf would be obligated to repurchase the notes at 101 of the aggregate principal amount of notes repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest 

 

during 2008 vf purchased 20 million shares of its common stock in open market transactions at a cost of 1497 million average price of 7486 during 2007 vf purchased 41 million shares of its common stock at a cost of 3500 million average price of 8503 using the proceeds from the sale of our intimate apparel business in addition vf purchased 20 million shares of its common stock in 2006 at a cost of 1186 million average price of 5929 per share the primary objective of our share repurchase program is to offset on a longterm basis dilution caused by awards under equity compensation plans under its current authorization from the board of directors vf may purchase an additional 32 million shares we do not currently intend to repurchase any shares in 2009 we will continue to evaluate future share repurchases considering funding required for business acquisitions our common stock price and levels of stock option exercises 

  cash dividends totaled 233 per common share in 2008 compared with 223 in 2007 and 194 in 2006 our dividend payout rate was 430 in 2008 compared with payout rates of 427 in 2007 and 411 in 2006 going forward we expect to pay dividends of approximately 40 of our diluted earnings per share the current indicated annual dividend rate for 2009 is 236 per share 

 

following is a summary of vf’s contractual obligations and commercial commitments at the end of 2008 that will require the use of funds 

 

 

 

 

  

we have other financial commitments at the end of 2008 that are not included in the above table but may require the use of funds under certain circumstances

during 2008 vf met its obligations when due from i cash flows from operations ii issuance of commercial paper and iii on a limited basis shortterm borrowings under international bank facilities credit market conditions and the general contraction of liquidity in the united states and global capital markets during 2008 particularly during the last half of the year had a significant impact on the ability of many companies to access the commercial paper and other capital markets vf was able to issue commercial paper for seasonal working capital needs during this period although for generally shorter maturities and at higher spreads over us treasury interest rates than in prior years if the commercial paper markets were not available vf has 13 billion of liquidity available under its domestic and international committed revolving bank credit agreements these agreements expire in 2012 management believes that vf’s cash balances and funds provided by operating activities as well as unused committed bank credit lines additional borrowing capacity and access to equity markets taken as a whole provide i adequate liquidity to meet all of its current and longterm obligations when due ii adequate liquidity to fund capital expenditures and to maintain our dividend payout policy and iii flexibility to meet investment opportunities that may arise 

 

we do not participate in transactions with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships established to facilitate offbalance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes 

 

risk management 

 

vf is exposed to a variety of market risks in the ordinary course of business and we regularly assess these potential risks we manage our exposures to these risks through our operating and financing activities and when appropriate by taking advantage of naturally offsetting exposures within vf or by creating offsetting positions through the use of derivative financial instruments derivative financial instruments are contracts whose value is based on or “derived” from changes in the value of an underlying currency exchange rate interest rate or other financial asset or index we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

 

vf had 3818 million of cash and equivalents at the end of 2008 cash equivalents are highly liquid investments that mature within three months of their purchase these investments consist of deposits in highly rated us and foreign commercial banks and investments in institutional money market funds that invest only in obligations issued or guaranteed by the us government considering recent credit market conditions and the weakened financial condition of many banks and other financial institutions we continually monitor vf’s cash equivalents and the credit ratings of vf’s financial institutions similarly we monitor the credit quality of investments in our defined benefit pension plan to ensure that the plan’s exposure to investments affected or likely to be affected by the credit market crisis is not significant 

 

we limit the risk of interest rate fluctuations on net income and cash flows by managing our mix of fixed and variable interest rate debt in addition we may also use derivative financial instruments to minimize our interest rate risk since all of our longterm debt has fixed interest rates our primary interest rate exposure relates to changes in interest rates on variable rate shortterm borrowings which averaged approximately 308 million during 2008 however any change in interest rates would also affect interest income earned on vf’s cash equivalents based on average amounts of borrowings having variable interest rates and cash equivalents during 2008 the effect of a hypothetical 10 change in interest rates on reported net income would not be significant 

 

vf is a global enterprise subject to the risk of foreign currency fluctuations approximately 30 of our revenues in 2008 were generated in international markets substantially all of our foreign businesses operate in functional currencies other than the us dollar assets and liabilities in these foreign businesses are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates during 2007 we entered into an international bank credit agreement that provides for eurodenominated borrowings although there were no borrowings under this agreement at the end of 2008 borrowings under the agreement could be used to reduce the exposure to currency rate changes for our eurodenominated net assets net advances to and investments in our foreign businesses primarily in europe latin american and asia are considered to be longterm and accordingly foreign currency translation effects on those net assets are deferred as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 

  loss in common stockholders’ equity we do not hedge these net investments and do not hedge the translation of foreign currency operating results into the us dollar 

 

we monitor net foreign currency market exposures and may in the ordinary course of business enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge the effects of exchange rate fluctuations for specific foreign currency transactions or a portion of our anticipated foreign currency cash flows use of these financial instruments allows us to reduce the overall exposure to exchange rate movements on vf’s cash flows since gains and losses on these contracts will offset losses and gains on the transactions or cash flows being hedged our practice is to hedge a portion of our net foreign currency cash flows anticipated during the following 12 months relating to crossborder inventory purchases production costs product sales and intercompany royalty payments by buying or selling primarily us dollar contracts against various currencies although vf is exposed to risk of loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to these foreign exchange contracts we believe these counterparties are creditworthy financial institutions we continually monitor our hedging positions with each counterparty and the credit ratings of the counterparties we will adjust our positions if necessary 

 

if there were a hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates of 10 compared with rates at the end of 2008 the expected effect on the change in fair value of the hedging contracts outstanding would result in an unrealized loss of approximately 45 million based on changes in the timing and amount of foreign currency exchange rate movements the actual unrealized loss could differ however any such change in the fair value of the hedging contracts would also result in an offsetting change in the value of the underlying transactions or anticipated cash flows being hedged 

 

vf is exposed to market risks for the pricing of cotton and other fibers which indirectly impacts fabric prices we manage our fabric prices by obtaining fixed price commitments for denim and other fabrics in some cases for up to one year in advance vf has not historically managed nor do we currently intend to manage commodity price exposures by using derivative instruments 

 

vf has nonqualified deferred compensation plans in which liabilities accrued for the plans’ participants are based on market values of investment funds that are selected by the participants the risk of changes in the market values of the participants’ investment selections is hedged by vf’s investment in a portfolio of securities that substantially mirrors the investment selections underlying the deferred compensation liabilities increases and decreases in deferred compensation liabilities are substantially offset by corresponding increases and decreases in the market value of vf’s investments resulting in a negligible net exposure to our operating results and financial position 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

we have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to accurately and fairly report vf’s operating results and financial position in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states we apply these accounting policies in a consistent manner our significant accounting policies are summarized in note a to the consolidated financial statements 

 

the application of these accounting policies requires that we make estimates and assumptions about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses contingent assets and liabilities and related disclosures these estimates assumptions and judgments are based on historical experience current trends and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and may retain outside specialists to assist in our evaluation in areas such as determining the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities in a business acquisition impairment testing for goodwill and intangible assets equity compensation pension benefits and selfinsured liabilities because our business cycle is relatively short ie from the date that we place an order to manufacture or purchase inventory until that inventory is sold and the trade receivable is collected actual results related to most of these estimates are known within a few months after any balance sheet date if actual results ultimately differ from previous estimates the revisions are included in results of operations in the period in which the actual amounts become known 

 

we believe the following accounting policies involve the most significant estimates assumptions and management judgments used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements or are the most sensitive to change from outside factors we have discussed the application of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 

  inventories 

 

our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value cost includes all material labor and overhead costs incurred to manufacture or purchase the finished goods overhead allocated to manufactured product is based on the normal capacity of our plants and does not include amounts related to idle capacity or abnormal production inefficiencies market value is based on a detailed review in each business unit at least quarterly of all inventories on the basis of individual styles or individual stylesizecolor stockkeeping units “skus” to identify slow moving or excess products discontinued and tobediscontinued products and offquality merchandise this review matches inventory on hand plus current production and purchase commitments with current and expected future sales orders for those units in inventory that are identified as slowmoving or excess quantities we estimate their market value based on historical experience and current realization trends this evaluation performed using a systematic and consistent methodology requires forecasts of future demand market conditions and selling prices if the forecasted market value on an individual style or sku basis is less than cost we provide an allowance to reflect the lower value of that inventory this methodology recognizes inventory exposures on an individual style or sku basis at the time such losses are evident rather than at the time goods are actually sold historically these estimates of future demand and selling prices have not varied significantly from actual results due to our timely identification and rapid disposal of these reduced value inventories 

 

physical inventory counts are taken on a regular basis we provide for estimated inventory losses that have likely occurred since the last physical inventory date historically our physical inventory shrinkage has not been significant 

 

longlived assets 

 

we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to the underlying tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values with any excess purchase price recorded as goodwill the process of assigning fair values particularly to acquired intangible assets is highly subjective as the fair value assessments are based on forecasts of future cash flows we use the same assumptions of future cash flows for assigning fair values to these assets that we used for evaluation of the business acquisition 

 

our depreciation policies for property plant and equipment and our amortization policies for definitelived intangible assets reflect judgments on the estimated economic lives of these assets in evaluating the useful lives and expected benefits to be received for customerrelated intangible assets we review historical attrition patterns for various groups of customers for licenserelated intangible assets we review historical trends and anticipated license renewal periods and attrition rates we review these assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be fully recoverable in those circumstances we measure recoverability of the carrying value of these assets by comparison with estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset this review requires estimates and assumptions about the forecasted amount and duration of future cash flows and residual value if any attributable to the assets being tested 

 

we evaluate indefinitelived trademark intangible assets and goodwill in all business units at least annually or more frequently if there is an indication of possible impairment we measure recoverability of an indefinitelived trademark intangible asset by comparing its fair value estimated using the “relieffromroyalty” method with its carrying value under the “relieffromroyalty” method forecasted global revenues for a trademark are assigned a royalty rate that would be charged to license the trademark from an independent party those forecasted royalties are discounted to a present value and the discounted fair value is compared with the carrying value of the trademark intangible asset 

 

the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill of an acquired business is assessed by comparing the carrying value of the business unit including recorded goodwill to the fair value of the business unit fair value is estimated using forecasted cash flows of a business unit discounted to a present value these assessments of intangible asset and goodwill fair values require management’s assumptions and judgment regarding business strategies future revenues and profitability working capital changes capital spending income tax rates and a discount rate that reflects the risks inherent in the forecasted cash flows 

 

based on our evaluations other than the charges in 2006 and 2007 in connection with the sale of our intimate apparel businesses the indicated fair values of our amortized assets indefinitelived trademark assets and goodwill exceeded the respective carrying amounts of those assets in each of the last three years and accordingly no 

  impairment charges were recognized if the estimated fair value of an acquired business were to decline due to changes in forecasted business operations or if we were to decide to discontinue use of its trademark or otherwise exit the business we may be exposed to an impairment charge which could be material 

 

stock options 

 

we use a lattice optionpricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees and nonemployee members of the board of directors we believe that a lattice model provides a refined estimate of the fair value of options because it can incorporate i historical option exercise patterns and multiple assumptions about future option exercise patterns for each of several groups of option holders and ii inputs that vary over time such as assumptions for interest rates and volatility we performed a rigorous review of all assumptions and believe that the assumptions employed in each valuation are reflective of our outstanding options and underlying common stock and of our groups of option participants our lattice valuation is based on the assumptions listed in note p to the consolidated financial statements 

 

one of the critical assumptions in the valuation process is estimating the expected average life of the options before exercise in each year we based our estimates on evaluations of the historical and expected option exercise patterns for each of several groups of option holders that have historically exhibited different option exercise patterns these evaluations included i voluntary stock option exercise patterns based on a combination of changes in the price of vf common stock and periods of time that options are outstanding before exercise and ii involuntary exercise patterns resulting from turnover retirement and mortality 

 

volatility is another critical assumption requiring judgment in each year we based our estimate of future volatility on a combination of implied and historical volatility implied volatility was based on shortterm 6 to 9 months publicly traded nearthemoney options on vf common stock we measured historical volatility over a ten year period corresponding to the contractual term of the options using daily stock price observations our assumption for valuation purposes was that expected volatility starts at a level equal to the implied volatility and then transitions to the historical volatility over the remainder of the ten year option term 

 

pension obligations 

 

vf sponsors a qualified defined benefit pension plan as a key retirement benefit for most domestic employees employed on or before december 31 2004 for employees covered by this plan vf also sponsors an unfunded supplemental defined benefit plan that provides benefits that exceed limitations imposed by income tax regulations the selection of appropriate actuarial assumptions for determination of our projected pension benefit liabilities and of our annual pension expense is significant due to the long time period over which benefits are accrued and paid we annually update participant demographics and the expected amount and timing of benefit payments we review annually the principal economic actuarial assumptions summarized in note n to the consolidated financial statements and modify them based on current rates and trends we also periodically review and modify as necessary other plan assumptions such as rates of retirement termination disability and mortality we believe our assumptions are reflective of the participants in and benefits provided by the plans and result in the best estimate of the plans’ future experience actual results may vary from the actuarial assumptions used 

 

one of the critical assumptions used in the actuarial model is the discount rate the discount rate is used to estimate the present value of future cash outflows required to meet our projected benefit obligations at each measurement date the discount rate reflects the interest rate inherent in the price that vf could settle its projected benefit obligations at the valuation date our discount rate assumption at each yearend is based on current market interest rates we select our discount rate based on matching high quality corporate bond yields to the timing of projected benefit payments to be made to participants in our pension plans we use the population of us corporate bonds rated ‘aa’ by moody’s investors service over 300 such bonds with at least 50 million outstanding that are noncallablenonputtable unless with makewhole provisions and exclude the highest and lowest yielding bonds the plans’ projected benefit payments are matched to current market interest rates over the expected payment period and a present value is developed that produces a single equivalent discount rate that recognizes our plans’ distinct liability characteristics despite the unusual conditions prevailing in the corporate bond markets in late 2008 we concluded that those ‘aa’ rated issues meet the “high quality” intent of the applicable accounting standards we believe our 2008 discount rate of 650 appropriately reflects current market conditions and the longterm nature of projected benefit payments to participants in our pension plans the discount rate for our plans may be higher than rates used for plans at some other companies because of our plans’ longer duration of expected 

  benefit payments due to i a higher percentage of female participants with a longer life expectancy and ii a higher percentage of inactive participants who will not begin receiving vested benefits for many years 

 

another critical assumption of the actuarial model is the expected longterm rate of return on investment assets in our qualified plan’s pension trust our investment objective is to maximize the longterm return on a diversified portfolio of assets at an acceptable level of risk plan assets are comprised of a diversified portfolio of domestic and international equity corporate and governmental fixed income and real estate securities we develop a projected rate of return for each of our investment asset classes based on several factors including the estimated inflation rate the premium to be earned in excess of a riskfree return the premium for equity risk and the premium for longer duration fixed income securities the weighted average of the projected longterm rate of return for the various classes of assets held by the plan provides the basis for the expected longterm rate of return actuarial assumption our rate of return assumption was 800 in 2008 and 825 in 2007 and 2006 our actual compounded annual rate of return since 1981 has exceeded 9 although our actual rate of return was lower than the 800 assumption for the trailing 10 and 15 year periods and was negative in 2008 we will constantly challenge the plan’s asset allocation giving consideration to changes that will appropriately balance anticipated investment returns with risk 

 

the sensitivity of changes in actuarial assumptions on our annual pension expense and on our plans’ projected benefit obligations all other factors being equal is illustrated by the following 

 

 

 

during 2007 and 2006 actual pension plan investment returns varied favorably compared with their respective actuarial assumptions in 2008 however there was a significant decline in the market value of our pension plan investment assets due to the global credit and financial market crisis resulting in over 450 million of accumulated net unrecognized actuarial losses at the end of 2008 accordingly our qualified defined benefit pension plan was significantly underfunded at the end of 2008 the underfunded status of our pension plans at the end of 2008 resulted in recognition of a 2910 million aftertax charge in accumulated other comprehensive income loss along with recognition of related current and noncurrent liabilities of 94 million and 4055 million respectively the funded status of our plans recognized in our consolidated balance sheets could change significantly in future years depending on investment portfolio performance changes in interest rates and the level of vf contributions to the qualified plan 

 

differences between actual results and the respective actuarial assumptions ie actuarial gains and losses related to investment returns discount rates and other assumptions do not affect the current year’s pension expense but instead are deferred and amortized to pension expense over future periods our policy is to amortize unrecognized actuarial gains and losses to pension expense as follows amounts totaling less than 10 of the lower of investment assets or projected benefit obligations at the beginning of the year are not amortized amounts totaling 10 to 20 of projected benefit obligations are amortized over the expected average remaining service of active participants and amounts in excess of 20 of projected benefit obligations at the beginning of the year are amortized over five years 

 

the cost of pension benefits earned by our covered employees commonly called “service cost” was 165 million in 2008 and has averaged 201 million per year over the last three years pension expense recognized in our financial statements was 108 million in 2008 131 million in 2007 and 375 million in 2006 expense in 2006 was significantly higher than the average annual service cost because that year included a significant cost component for amortization of accumulated unrecognized actuarial losses as discussed in the preceding paragraph our pension expense for 2008 and 2007 decreased significantly from 2006 due to reduced amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses higher investment returns on a larger amount of plan assets arising from discretionary funding contributions totaling 2600 million over the period 2003 — 2006 and an increase in the discount 

  rate used to value our projected benefit liabilities because of the significant investment losses incurred in the plan’s investment portfolio in 2008 pension expense for 2009 will include a significant cost component for amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses this significant amortization cost component plus expected reduced investment portfolio earnings due to a lower amount of plan assets will cause our pension expense to increase to approximately 98 million for 2009 from 108 million in 2008 

 

vf is not required under applicable regulations and does not currently intend to make a contribution to the qualified pension plan during 2009 but does intend to make contributions totaling 94 million during 2009 to fund payments under the supplemental pension plan we believe that vf has sufficient liquidity to make contributions to the qualified plan as necessary in future years to return the plan to a fully or substantially fully funded status 

 

effective december 31 2004 vf’s domestic defined benefit plans were amended to close the plans to new entrants the amendments did not affect the benefits of plan participants at that date or their accrual of future benefits domestic employees hired after that date plus employees at certain acquired businesses not covered by those plans now participate in a new defined contribution arrangement with vf contributing amounts based on a percentage of eligible compensation funds contributed under this new benefit arrangement are invested as directed by the participants this defined contribution feature did not have a significant effect on our total retirement benefit expense over the last three years however on a longerterm basis the service cost component of our defined benefit plans’ expense is expected to decline as a percentage of our total retirement benefit expense and the yeartoyear variability of our retirement benefit expense should decrease 

 

income taxes 

 

as a global company vf is subject to income tax and files income tax returns in over 100 domestic and foreign jurisdictions each year the calculation of our income tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations which are subject to legal and factual interpretation and significant management judgment 

 

vf’s income tax returns are regularly examined by federal state and foreign tax authorities and those audits may result in proposed adjustments we have reviewed all issues raised upon examination as well as any exposure for issues that may be raised in future examinations we have evaluated these potential issues under the “morelikelythannot” standard of fasb interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of fasb statement no 109  a tax position is recognized if it meets this standard and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized such judgments and estimates may change based on audit settlements court cases and interpretation of tax laws and regulations our income tax expense could be materially affected to the extent we prevail in a tax position or when the statute of limitations expires for a tax position for which accruals have been established or to the extent we are required to pay amounts greater than established accruals we do not currently anticipate any material impact on earnings from the ultimate resolution of income tax uncertainties there are no accruals for general or unknown tax expenses 

 

we have recorded 1332 million of deferred income tax assets related to operating loss and capital loss carryforwards and we have recorded 934 million of valuation allowances against those assets realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income in specific jurisdictions the amount and timing of which are uncertain possible changes in tax laws and tax planning strategies if in our judgment it appears that we will not be able to generate sufficient taxable income or capital gains to offset losses during the carryforward periods we have recorded valuation allowances to reduce those deferred tax assets to amounts expected to be ultimately realized if in a future period we determine that the amount of deferred tax assets to be realized differs from the net recorded amount we would record an adjustment to income tax expense in that future period 

 

we have not provided us income taxes on a portion of our foreign subsidiaries’ undistributed earnings because we intend to invest those earnings indefinitely if we were to decide to remit those earnings to the united states in a future period our provision for income taxes could increase in that period

 item 1 business 

vf corporation organized in 1899 is a worldwide leader in branded lifestyle apparel and related products unless the context indicates otherwise the terms “vf” “we” “us” and “our” used herein refer to vf corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries our stated vision is vf will grow by building lifestyle brands that excite consumers around the world 

for over 100 years vf has grown by offering consumers high quality high value branded apparel and related products since 2004 we have been implementing a growth plan that is transforming vf’s mix of business to include more lifestyle brands lifestyle brands are those brands that connect closely with consumers because they are aspirational and inspirational they reflect consumers’ specific activities and interests lifestyle brands generally extend across multiple product categories and have high margins and strong revenue growth rates accordingly this transformation has included the acquisitions of several growing lifestyle brands such as vans Ò  reef Ò  kipling Ò  napapijri Ò  7 for all mankind Ò and lucy Ò  at the same time we have continued to make investments in our other businesses such as extension of the north face â brand to new product categories and new markets investments in our nautica â men’s and women’s sportswear and in nautica â brand equity expansion of lee â  wrangler â and other brands into asian and eastern european markets and acquisitions of the majestic â brand of athletic apparel and of a business having rights to market the licensed harleydavidson Ò brand for apparel 

  an important step in the continued transformation of vf was the sale in 2007 of our women’s intimate apparel business which had lower profit and growth prospects this business which had 2006 revenues in excess of 800 million included all of vf’s domestic and international women’s intimate apparel business units the women’s intimate apparel business is separately reported as discontinued operations in this annual report the remaining discussion of vf’s business unless otherwise stated is focused on vf’s continuing operations see additional discussion in note c to the consolidated financial statements included at item 8 of this report regarding our discontinued operations 

accordingly with acquisitions of growing lifestyle brands and the sale of our women’s intimate apparel business vf is a far different company today than it was four years ago and with the continuing execution of our growth plan vf is expected to be a different company five years from now 

vf is a highly diversified apparel company — across brands product categories channels of distribution and geographies vf owns a broad portfolio of brands in the jeanswear outerwear packs footwear sportswear and occupational apparel these products are marketed to consumers shopping in specialty stores upscale and traditional department stores national chains and mass merchants in addition many products are sold directly to consumers through vfoperated retail stores and internet sites as well as monobrand retail stores operated by independent parties a global company vf derives 28 of its revenues from outside the united states primarily in europe canada latin america and asia vf products are also sold in some geographic areas through licensees and distributors to provide many types of products across numerous channels of distribution in different geographic areas we have implemented a strategy that balances efficient and flexible internallyowned manufacturing with sourcing of finished goods from independent contractors an array of stateoftheart technologies enable us to get the right products to our customers at the right time 

vf’s businesses are organized primarily into product categories and by brands within those categories for both management and internal financial reporting purposes these groupings of businesses are called “coalitions” and consist of the following jeanswear outdoor imagewear sportswear and contemporary brands the contemporary brands coalition was formed in august 2007 with the acquisitions of seven for all mankind llc and lucy activewear inc these coalitions are treated as reportable segments for financial reporting purposes coalition management has responsibility to build their brands with certain financial administrative and systems support and disciplines provided by consolidated functions within vf 

we consider our outdoor sportswear and contemporary brands coalitions to be our lifestyle coalitions these are vf’s growth engines where we expect longterm revenue and profit growth at a midsingle digit to lowdouble digit rate our jeanswear and imagewear coalitions are our heritage businesses where our focus is on strong profitability and cash flows with revenue growth at a lowsingle digit rate 

the following table summarizes vf’s primary owned and licensed brands by coalition 

   

financial information regarding vf’s coalitions as well as geographic information and sales by product category are included in note r to the consolidated financial statements which are included at item 8 of this report 

jeanswear coalition 

the jeanswear coalition markets jeanswear and related casual products in the united states and in many international markets the largest of these brands the lee â   and wrangler â brands have longstanding traditions as authentic american jeans brands as they were established in 1889 and 1947 respectively and have strong market positions lee â   and wrangler â products are sold in nearly every developed country products also include shorts casual pants knit and woven tops and outerwear which are designed to complement the jeanswear products and have helped to extend our brands 

  in domestic markets lee â products are sold primarily through national chain stores and specialty stores wrangler â westernwear is marketed through western specialty stores the wrangler hero â  rustler â and riders â brands are marketed to mass merchant and regional discount stores overall vf’s jeans brands are sold in the us marketplace in channels where there is significant volume and less fashion risk despite significant competitive activity vf’s domestic jeanswear revenues have been stable in recent years including all of its jeanswear brands we believe that vf has the largest unit market share of jeans in the united states and is one of the largest marketers of jeans in the world we also market cotton casual pants under the lee casuals â  timber creek by wrangler â and wrangler â khakis brands 

we believe our vendor managed inventory and retail floor space management programs with several of our major retailer customers give us a competitive advantage in our domestic jeanswear business we receive pointofsale information from these customers on a daily basis on an individual store and stylesizecolor stockkeeping unit “sku” level we then ship products based on that data to ensure the customers’ selling floors are appropriately stocked with products that match their shoppers’ needs our systems capabilities allow us to analyze our retail customer’s sales demographic and geographic data to develop product assortment recommendations that maximize the productivity of their jeanswear selling space and minimize their investment in inventory 

jeanswear in most international markets is more fashionoriented and has a higher selling price than similar products in the united states the jeans market internationally is also more fragmented than in the united states with competitors ranging from global brands to a number of smaller national or regional brands 

vf’s largest international jeanswear business is located in western europe lee â and wrangler â jeanswear products are sold through department stores and specialty stores where we employ some of the same retail floor space management programs described above hero by wrangler â  maverick â and old axe â products are sold to hypermarket and discount stores we also market lee â and wrangler â products to mass market and specialty stores in canada and mexico as well as to department stores and specialty stores in asia and south america in many international markets we are expanding our reach through vfoperated retail stores an increasingly important vehicle for presenting our brands’ image and marketing message directly to consumers in addition lee â and wrangler â products are sold in over 400 independently operated monobrand retail stores primarily in eastern europe and south america 

lee â products are also manufactured and marketed in spain and portugal through a 50owned joint venture we are continuing to expand our jeanswear brands in emerging markets such as china and russia and in 2006 entered into a majorityowned joint venture to design and market vfbranded products in india including the lee â and wrangler â brands in foreign markets where vf does not have owned operations lee â and wrangler â jeanswear and related products are marketed through distributors agents or licensees 

in the united states we believe our jeanswear coalition brands can grow in the mass market and national chain channels of distribution and through extension into new product categories in our international businesses growth will be driven by i upgraded product positioning and marketing in europe ii expansion of our existing businesses in china russia and india and iii continued rollout of new retail stores

imagewear coalition 

the imagewear coalition consists of an occupational apparel division and an activewear division each representing approximately onehalf of coalition revenues 

occupational workwear career and safety apparel are sold by the imagewear coalition under the red kap â    bulwark â  the force â and chef designs ™ brands in north america approximately twothirds of these sales are to industrial laundries resellers and distributors that in turn supply work clothes to employers primarily on a rental basis for onthejob wear by production service and whitecollar personnel products include work pants slacks work and dress shirts overalls jackets and smocks  since industrial laundries maintain minimal inventories of work clothes a supplier’s ability to offer rapid delivery is an important factor in this market our commitment to customer service supported by an automated central distribution center with several satellite locations has enabled customer orders to be filled within 24 hours of receipt and has helped the red kap â brand obtain a significant share of the industrial laundry rental business 

the remaining part of the occupational apparel division is developing and managing corporate image uniform and casual apparel programs for selected national accounts primarily through over 70 catalog web sites maintained for major business customers eg fedex corporation air canada continental airlines and american airlines and governmental organizations eg us customs and border protection transportation security administration national park service fire department of new york city and new york city transit authority these web sites give more than 700000 employees of these customers the convenience of shopping for their work and career apparel via the internet

the imagewear coalition’s growth in recent years has been driven by i the 2007 acquisition of the majestic â brand and related assets ii expansion of the national football league contract to include additional apparel categories iii increased fan interest in both the national football league and major league baseball iv acquisition of a business having rights to market licensed harleydavidson â branded apparel and v use of vf’s retail floor space management and replenishment capabilities to put the right product assortment on the retailers’ sales floor in each geographic market 

looking forward we intend to drive occupational apparel and activewear growth by leveraging imagewear’s ability to manage a complex mix of products where speedtomarket product customization and superior service give us a competitive advantage 

  sportswear coalition 

the nautica â brand is the principal lifestyle brand of the sportswear coalition nautica â sportswear is marketed in the department store and specialty store channels of distribution in the united states the department store channel has undergone significant consolidation in the last three years resulting in numerous store closings and negatively impacting sales of nautica â brand products the principal nautica â product line is men’s sportswear noted for its classic styling nautica â is the number two men’s sportswear brand in department stores other men’s nautica â   product lines include men’s outerwear underwear swimwear and sleepwear the nautica jeans company â   line features fashionable jeanswear and related tops for younger male consumers a collection of nautica â women’s sportswear was launched in a limited number of department store doors in fall 2006 with additional doors added in 2007 nautica â women’s sportswear has not met our expectations but we are refining the product offerings and assortments to position this line for the future 

the sportswear coalition operates approximately 120 nautica â retail outlet stores in better outlet malls across the united states these stores also carry nautica â merchandise for men women boys and girls the product styles sold in the outlet stores are different from the nautica â styles sold to department and specialty store wholesale customers these outlet stores also carry nautica â merchandise from licensees to complete their product assortment in addition independent licensees operate over 200 nautica â brand retail stores across the world 

the nautica â   brand is licensed in the united states for apparel categories not produced by vf eg tailored clothing dress shirts neckwear women’s swimwear accessories such as fragrances watches eyewear and for nonapparel categories eg bedroom and bathroom linens nautica â products are licensed for sale in over 40 countries outside the united states wholesale sales of nautica â licensed products total approximately 500 million on an annual basis

the sportswear coalition also includes the kipling â business in north america  kipling â handbags and accessories are sold through specialty stores department stores and vfoperated retail stores about twothirds of products are the same as those sold in europe with the remainder designed specifically for the us market 

we believe there is growth potential in each of our sportswear brands

contemporary brands coalition 

contemporary brands our newest coalition is focused on upscale lifestyle brands formed in august 2007 it is currently composed of the 7 for all mankind â and lucy â brands 

7 for all mankind â is a los angelesbased brand of luxury denim jeans and related products — knit and woven tops sweaters jackets and accessories — for women and men products are noted for their fit and for innovation in design fabric and finish the 7 for all mankind â brand is the leading premium jeans brand in the united states with the premium segment defined as jeans retailing for 100 or more retail price points for the brand’s core jeans range from 149  199 for basics with higher price points for more fashionforward products with approximately threefourths of sales in the united states the brand is marketed 

  through upscale department stores such as bloomingdale’s macy’s neiman marcus nordstrom and saks and through specialty stores international sales primarily in europe are through department stores such as harrods and specialty stores we are pursuing growth opportunities in several areas — directtoconsumer expansion through companyoperated retail stores and ecommerce additional sportswear product offerings geographic expansion and licensing 

based in portland oregon the lucy â brand of women’s lifestyle apparel is marketed through approximately 60 lucy â branded retail stores across the united states and via the internet lucy â is an activewear brand designed for versatility comfort and fit for today’s active woman while other activewear brands are targeted primarily at serious athletes or male consumers lucy â is a functional and stylish brand that women can wear from workout to weekend currently approximately 85 of the products in the lucy â retail stores are lucy â branded with the balance of the offerings being complementary lines including reef â sandals looking forward we expect that substantially all of the products in the stores will be lucy â branded and we plan to significantly expand the number of retail stores 

we expect to grow the 7 for all mankind â brand through retail and international expansion and new product lines lucy â will grow through opening stores in new markets we also expect that there are opportunities to leverage vf’s supply chain capabilities for both brands for future profitability improvements 

directtoconsumer operations 

vfoperated retail stores are an integral part of our strategy for growing vf’s brands particularly our lifestyle brands our full price retail stores allow us to showcase a brand’s full line of current season products with fixturing and imagery that support the brand’s positioning these stores provide high visibility for our brands and products and enable us to stay close to the needs and preferences of consumers the proper presentation of products in our retail stores also helps to increase consumer purchases of vf products at our wholesale customers vfoperated retail stores provide strong operating profits and a good return on our investment in addition outlet stores serve an important role in our overall inventory management by allowing vf to effectively sell a significant portion of discontinued and outofseason products at better prices than are otherwise available from outside parties while maintaining the integrity of our brands 

our growing global retail operations include 560 stores that sell the north face â  vans â  napapijri â  kipling â  7 for all mankind â  lucy â  nautica â  lee â or wrangler â products most of these retail stores offer products at full price while some are in outlet locations offering products at discounted prices these stores are generally monobrand stores meaning that only one brand’s products are offered in each store in addition to these primarily monobrand retail and outlet stores we operate 76 vf outlet stores across the united states that sell a broad selection of excess quantities of first quality vf products plus women’s intimate apparel and childrenswear both product categories that vf has exited in recent years but which consumers expect to find in vf outlet stores 

  across the globe internet sales ie ecommerce comprise a small but growing portion of total retail apparel footwear and accessories sales ecommerce sales of apparel and footwear have become the second largest category of ecommerce purchases in the united states behind travel purchases at vf ecommerce is a growing portion of our revenues as we currently market the lee â  vans â  7 for all mankind â  lucy â and kipling â brands directly to consumers additional ecommerce sites including sites offering the north face â and nautica â products will be rolled out for consumers in 2008 

total retail store and ecommerce sales accounted for 14 of vf’s consolidated total revenues in both 2007 and 2006 we expect our directtoconsumer business to continue to grow at a faster pace than vf’s overall growth rate capital investments of approximately 60 million are planned for leasehold improvements fixtures and equipment for approximately 100 new retail locations during 2008 

in addition to the directtoconsumer venues operated by vf our licensees distributors and other independent parties currently sell several of our brands through over 900 independentlyoperated monobrand retail stores located primarily in eastern europe and asia 

licensing arrangements 

as part of our business strategy of expanding market penetration of owned brands we enter into licensing agreements for specific apparel and complementary product categories in identified geographic regions if such arrangements with independent parties can provide more effective manufacturing distribution and marketing of such products than could be achieved internally these licensing arrangements relate to a broad range of vf brands and are for fixed terms of generally five years with conditional renewal options each licensee pays royalties to vf based on its sales of licensed products with most agreements providing for a minimum royalty requirement royalties generally range from 5 to 7 of the licensing partners’ net sales of licensed products gross royalty income was approximately 78 million in each of 2007 and 2006 with the largest contribution from the nautica Ò brand 

in addition licensees are generally required to spend a specified amount to advertise vf’s products ranging from 1 to 5 of their net licensed product sales in some cases these advertising amounts are remitted to vf for advertising on behalf of the licensees we provide support to these business partners and ensure the integrity of our brand names by taking an active role in the design quality control advertising marketing and distribution of each licensed product 

vf has also entered into license agreements to use thirdparty trademarks apparel is marketed under licenses granted by major league baseball the national football league the national basketball association the national hockey league harleydavidson motor company inc nascar espn inc and major colleges most of which contain minimum annual licensing and advertising requirements 

we believe that the loss of any license with vf as either licensor or licensee would not have a material adverse effect on vf 

manufacturing sourcing and distribution 

  product design fit fabric finish and quality are important in all of our businesses these functions are performed by employees located within each of our branded businesses across the globe 

vf’s centralized global supply chain organization sources product and ultimately bears the responsibility to deliver product to our customers vf is highly skilled in managing the complexity associated with the supply chain — 600 million units and 600000 skus spread over 30 brands 40 vfoperated and 1400 contractor manufacturing facilities over 30 distribution centers and over 600 retail stores managing this complexity is made possible by our use of information systems technologies — with bestofbreed systems for product development forecasting order management warehouse management etc attached to our core enterprise resource management platform 

our domestic jeanswear and imagewear businesses operate owned manufacturing facilities primarily cutting sewing and finishing principally located in mexico and central america our international jeanswear businesses operate manufacturing facilities located in poland and turkey for these owned production plants we purchase raw materials from numerous domestic and international suppliers to meet scheduled production needs raw materials include fabrics made from cotton synthetics and blends of cotton and synthetic yarn as well as thread and trim product identification buttons zippers and snaps in some limited instances we contract the sewing of vfowned raw materials into finished product with independent contractors in the united states mexico and central america while we obtain fixed price commitments for denim and certain supplies for up to one year in advance specific purchase obligations with suppliers are typically limited to the succeeding two to six months our only longterm contract for the purchase of raw materials or finished products is a commitment in connection with the sale of vf’s childrenswear business in 2004 this agreement requires vf to purchase approximately 93 million of finished product for sale through our vf outlet stores with a minimum commitment of 15 million per year no single supplier represents more than 3 of our total cost of sales 

our current sourcing strategy for products sold in the united states includes a balance of vfowned production in the western hemisphere contracted production in the western hemisphere and contracted production from asia owned production generally has a lower cost than contracted production product obtained from contractors in the western hemisphere generally has higher cost but gives us greater flexibility and shorter lead times and allows for lower inventory levels as compared with production obtained from the far east and other more distant resources approximately 44 of units sold in the united states and 28 of the dollar value of domestic net sales in 2007 were manufactured in vfowned facilities primarily in mexico and central america with the balance obtained from contractors primarily in asia this combination of vfowned and contracted production along with different geographic regions and cost structures provides a balanced approach to product sourcing 

to an increasing extent we are using independent contractors who own the raw materials and ship only finished readyforsale products to vf these contractors are engaged through vf sourcing hubs in hong kong with several satellite offices across asia and miami these hubs are responsible for product procurement product quality assurance supplier management transportation and shipping functions in the eastern and western hemispheres respectively substantially all products in the outdoor and sportswear coalitions as well as a growing portion of product requirements for our jeanswear and imagewear coalitions are obtained through these sourcing hubs for most products in our contemporary brands coalition we currently contract the sewing and finishing of vfowned raw materials through a network of independent domestic and international contractors some of this volume will be shifted to the vf sourcing hubs during 2008 

today 26 of our total net sales relates to products manufactured in vfowned facilities in mexico europe and central america and 74 relates to products obtained from contractors primarily in asia where we manufacture in vfowned facilities our product costs are lower than any available on a global basis for like products we believe a combination of vfowned and contracted production from different geographic regions provides flexibility and a competitive advantage in our product sourcing 

management continually monitors new developments and risks related to duties tariffs and quotas we limit vf’s sourcing exposure through among other measures i extensive geographic diversification with a mix of vfoperated and contracted production ii shifts of production among countries and contractors iii allocation of production to merchandise categories where the free flow of product is available and iv sourcing from countries with tariff preference and free trade agreements we will continue to manage our supply chain from a global perspective and adjust as needed to changes in the global production environment 

all contracted production must meet vf’s high quality standards further each of the approximately 1400 independent contractor facilities that manufacture products for vf must be precertified prior to performance of any production on vf’s behalf this precertification includes passing a factory inspection and signing a vf terms of engagement agreement these requirements provide strict standards covering age of workers hours 

  of work health and safety conditions and conformity with local laws we also require our independent licensees and their contractors to comply with these standards we maintain an ongoing audit program to ensure compliance with these requirements by using dedicated internal and outsourced staff additional information about vf’s global compliance principles terms of engagement factory audit procedure and factory compliance guidelines along with a global compliance report are available on the vf website at wwwvfccom 

vf did not experience difficulty in filling its raw material and contracting production needs during 2007 we do not anticipate difficulties in meeting our raw materials and contracting production requirements during 2008 the loss of any one supplier or contractor would not have a significant adverse effect on our business 

product is shipped from our independent suppliers and vfoperated manufacturing plants to many distribution centers in the united states and international markets as well as directly to our customers product is inspected sorted and stored in our distribution centers until needed for packing and shipping to our wholesale customers or our retail stores most distribution centers support multiple brands our distribution centers use computercontrolled inventory management technology for efficient tracking and movement of products 

  seasonality 

with its diversified product offerings vf’s operating results are somewhat seasonal on a quarterly basis and excluding the effect of businesses acquired during 2007 consolidated total revenues for 2007 ranged from a low of approximately 21 of full year revenues in the second quarter to a high of 29 in the third quarter this disparity results primarily from the seasonal influences on revenues of our outdoor coalition approximately 19 of outdoor coalition revenues occurred in the second quarter and 34 in the third quarter of 2007 with recent acquisitions growth of our retail operations and other changes in our business historical quarterly revenue and expense trends may not be indicative of future trends and the portion of annual revenues occurring in the second half of the year is expected to increase 

working capital requirements vary throughout the year working capital increases during the first half of the year as inventory builds to support peak shipping periods and then decreases during the second half of the year as those inventories are sold cash provided by operating activities is substantially higher in the second half of the year due to higher net income and reduced working capital requirements during that period 

advertising and customer support 

we support vf’s brands through extensive advertising and promotional programs that promote specific products or convey a lifestyle image for a specific brand we advertise in consumer and trade publications on national and local radio and television and on the internet we also participate in cooperative advertising on a shared cost basis with major retailers in print media radio and television we sponsor various sporting music and other special events and sponsor a number of athletes and other personalities in addition we provide pointofsale fixtures and signage to our wholesale customers to enhance the presentation of our products in their retail locations this includes shopinshops which are separate retail sales areas for a specific vf brand within a department store or other retail customer location 

we also participate in various retail customer incentive programs these incentive programs with retailers include discounts cooperative advertising funds and margin support funds we also offer sales incentive programs directly to consumers in the form of rebate and coupon offers sales incentive offers with retailers and with consumers are recognized as sales discounts in arriving at reported net sales except that cooperative advertising reimbursements of retailer advertising costs which are documented and independently verified to support their fair value are reported as advertising expense 

during 2007 we spent 362 million on advertising and promoting our brands a 12 increase from the 2006 level we employ marketing sciences to optimize both the level and impact of advertising and promotional spending and to identify the types of spending that provide the greatest return on our marketing investments 

internet web sites are maintained for most of our brands some of them are businesstoconsumer ecommerce sites where consumers can order vf products other consumer web sites only provide information about our brands and products and in many cases direct consumers to our wholesale customers where they can purchase 

  our products we also operate several businesstobusiness sites where our retail customers can order vf products 

our jeanswear outdoor sportswear and contemporary brands coalitions employ a staff of instore marketing and merchandising coordinators located in major cities across the united states these individuals visit our customers’ retail locations to inform the customers’ sales force about our products and related promotions and to ensure that our products and those of our licensees are properly presented on the merchandise sales floor 

other matters

  employees 

vf employed approximately 54200 men and women at the end of 2007 of which approximately 20000 were located in the united states approximately 1000 employees in the united states are covered by a collective bargaining agreement in international markets a significant percentage of employees are covered by tradesponsored or governmental bargaining arrangements employee relations are considered to be good

 item 1a risk factors 

the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating vf’s business and the forwardlooking statements contained in this form 10k any of the following risks could materially adversely affect vf’s business its operating results and its financial condition 

  risks specific to vf corporation 

a substantial portion of vf’s revenues and gross profit is derived from a small number of large customers the loss of any of these customers could substantially reduce vf’s profits 

a few of vf’s customers account for a significant portion of revenues sales to vf’s ten largest customers were 27 of total revenues in fiscal 2007 with walmart stores inc accounting for 12 of revenues sales are generally on a purchase order basis and we do not have longterm agreements with any of our customers a decision by any of vf’s major customers to decrease significantly the number of products purchased from vf could substantially reduce revenues and have a material adverse effect on vf’s financial condition and results of operations moreover the retail industry has experienced consolidation and other ownership changes such as the merger of federated department stores inc and the may department stores company in 2005 and the merger of sears roebuck and company and kmart holding corporation in 2005 in the future retailers may further consolidate undergo restructurings or reorganizations realign their affiliations or reposition their stores’ target market these developments could reduce the number of stores that carry vf’s products or increase the ownership concentration within the retail industry these changes could both impact vf’s opportunities in the market and increase vf’s reliance on a smaller number of large customers 

vf’s business could be adversely affected by financial instability experienced by its customers 

during the past several years various retailers have experienced significant financial difficulties which in some cases have resulted in bankruptcies liquidations and store closings the financial difficulties of a customer could result in reduced business with that customer vf may also assume higher credit risk relating to receivables of a customer experiencing financial difficulty if these developments occur our inability to shift sales to other customers or to collect on vf’s trade accounts receivable from a major customer could substantially reduce vf’s income and have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations 

the apparel industry is highly competitive and vf’s success depends on its ability to respond to constantly changing fashion trends and consumer demand reduced sales or prices resulting from competition could have a material adverse effect on vf 

vf competes with numerous brands and manufacturers of apparel some of our competitors may be larger and have more resources than vf in certain product categories in addition vf competes directly with the private label brands of its wholesale customers vf’s ability to compete within the apparel and footwear industries depends on its ability to 

 

the failure to compete effectively or to keep pace with rapidly changing markets and trends could have a material adverse effect on vf’s business financial condition and results of operations in addition if we misjudge fashion trends and market conditions we could be faced with significant excess inventories for some products that we may have to sell at a loss or missed opportunities that may result in lost sales 

vf’s profitability may decline as a result of increasing pressure on margins 

  the apparel industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors including intense competition consolidation in the retail industry pressure from retailers to reduce the costs of products and changes in consumer demand these factors may cause us to reduce our sales prices to retailers and consumers which could cause vf’s gross margin to decline if we are unable to offset price reductions with comparable reductions in operating costs if vf’s sales prices decline and we fail to sufficiently reduce our product costs or operating expenses vf’s profitability will decline this could have a material adverse effect on vf’s results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

vf has entered into license agreements to use the trademarks of others loss of a license could have an adverse effect on vf’s operating results 

vf has entered into agreements to market products under licenses granted by third parties including major league baseball the national football league and harleydavidson motor company inc some of these licenses are for a short term and do not contain renewal options although we anticipate being able to renew those licenses before the agreements expire loss of a license which in certain cases could result in an impairment charge for related intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on vf’s operating results

vf may not succeed in implementing its growth strategy 

one of our key strategic objectives is growth we seek to grow through both organic growth and acquisitions building new growing lifestyle brands expanding our share with winning customers stretching vf’s brands and customers to new geographies fueling the growth by leveraging our supply chain and information technology capabilities across vf expanding our directtoconsumer business and building new growth enablers by identifying and developing high potential employees we may not be able to grow our existing businesses or achieve planned cost savings from ongoing businesses we may have difficulty identifying acquisition targets and we may not be able to successfully integrate a newly acquired business or achieve any expected cost savings or synergies from such integration we may not be able to expand our market share with winning customers expand our brands geographically or achieve the expected results from our supply chain initiatives we may also have difficulty recruiting or developing qualified managers the failure to implement its growth strategies may have a material adverse effect on vf’s business 

if vf encounters problems with its distribution system vf’s ability to deliver its products to the market would be adversely affected 

vf relies on its distribution facilities to warehouse and using its own employees or in some cases independent contractors to ship product to its customers vf’s distribution system includes computercontrolled and automated equipment which means its operations are complicated and may be subject to a number of risks related to security or computer viruses the proper operation of software and hardware electronic or power interruptions or other system failures because substantially all of vf’s products are distributed from a relatively small number of locations vf’s operations could also be interrupted by earthquakes floods fires or other natural disasters near its distribution centers we maintain business interruption insurance but it may not adequately protect vf from the adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in vf’s distribution facilities such as the longterm loss of customers or an erosion of brand image in addition vf’s distribution capacity is dependent on the timely performance of services by third parties including the transportation of product to and from its distribution facilities if we encounter problems with our distribution system our ability to meet customer expectations manage inventory complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies could be materially adversely affected 

vf relies significantly on information technology any inadequacy interruption integration failure or security failure of that technology could harm vf’s ability to effectively operate its business 

our ability to effectively manage and operate our business depends significantly on its information technology systems the failure of these systems to operate effectively problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems difficulty in integrating new systems or systems of acquired businesses or a breach in security of these systems could adversely impact the operations of vf’s business moreover vf and its customers could suffer harm if customer information were accessed by third parties due to a security failure in vf’s systems it could also require significant expenditures to remediate any such failure problem or breach 

vf uses foreign suppliers and manufacturing facilities for a substantial portion of its raw materials and finished products which poses risks to vf’s business operations 

during fiscal 2007 approximately 74 of vf’s products sold were produced by and purchased or procured from independent manufacturers primarily located in asia with substantially all of the remainder produced by vfowned and operated 

  manufacturing facilities located in eastern europe mexico and central america although no single supplier and no one country is critical to vf’s production needs any of the following could materially and adversely affect our ability to produce or deliver vf products and as a result have a material adverse effect on vf’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

if vf’s suppliers fail to use acceptable ethical business practices vf’s business could suffer 

we require third party suppliers to operate in compliance with applicable laws rules and regulations regarding working conditions employment practices and environmental compliance additionally we require all suppliers making vfbranded apparel whether directly for vf or for its licensees to comply with vf’s terms of engagement and global compliance principles our staff and third parties retained for such purposes periodically visit and audit the operations of vf’s owned and operated facilities and those of independent contractors manufacturing product for vf to determine compliance however we do not control independent manufacturers or their labor and other business practices if one of our independent contractors violates labor or other laws or implements labor or other business practices that are generally regarded as unethical in the united states the shipment of finished products to vf could be interrupted orders could be cancelled relationships could be terminated and vf’s reputation could be damaged any of these events could have a material adverse effect on vf’s revenues and consequently its results of operations 

vf’s results of operations could be materially harmed if vf is unable to accurately forecast demand for its products 

we often schedule internal production and place orders for products with independent manufacturers before our customers’ orders are firm therefore if we fail to accurately forecast customer demand we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of product to deliver to our customers factors that could affect our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products include 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory writedowns and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices which could have an adverse effect on vf’s results of operations and financial condition in addition if we underestimate demand for our products our manufacturing facilities or third party manufacturers may not be able to produce products to meet customer requirements and this could result in delays in the shipment of products and lost revenues as well as damage to vf’s reputation and customer relationships there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully manage inventory demand to meet future order and reorder requirements 

the loss of members of vf’s executive management and other key employees could have a material adverse effect on its business 

vf depends on the services and management experience of its executive officers and business leaders who have substantial experience and expertise in vf’s business vf also depends on other key employees involved in the operation of its business competition for qualified personnel in the apparel industry is intense the unexpected loss of services of one or more of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on vf 

vf may be unable to protect its trademarks and other intellectual property rights 

vf’s trademarks and other intellectual property rights are important to its success and its competitive position vf is susceptible to others imitating its products and infringing its intellectual property rights with the shift in product mix to higher priced brands vf is more susceptible to infringement of its intellectual property rights some of vf’s brands such as the north face â  jansport â  nautica â  wrangler â and lee â brands enjoy significant worldwide consumer recognition and the generally higher pricing of such products creates additional risk of counterfeiting and infringement 

infringement or counterfeiting of vf’s products or its other intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our brands or otherwise adversely affect vf revenues actions we have taken to establish and protect vf’s intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of its products by others or to prevent others from seeking to invalidate its trademarks or block sales of vf’s products as a violation of the trademarks and intellectual property rights of others in addition unilateral actions in the united states or other countries such as changes to or the repeal of laws recognizing trademark or other intellectual property rights could have an impact on vf’s ability to enforce those rights 

the value of vf’s intellectual property could diminish if others assert rights in or ownership of trademarks and other intellectual property rights of vf or in trademarks that are similar to vf’s trademarks or trademarks that vf licenses andor markets we may be unable to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction in some cases there may be trademark owners who have prior rights to vf’s trademarks because the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states in other cases there may be holders who have prior rights to similar trademarks vf is from time to time involved in opposition and cancellation proceedings with respect to some items of its intellectual property 

vf obtains licensing royalties and relies on its licensees to maintain the value of its brands 

only a relatively small portion of vf’s revenues 78 million or 11 was derived from licensing royalties in 2007 although vf generally has significant control over its licensee products and advertising we rely on them for among other things operational and financial controls over their businesses failure of our licensees to successfully market licensed products or our inability to replace existing licensees 

  could adversely affect vf’s revenues both directly from reduced royalties received and indirectly from reduced sales of our other products risks are also associated with a licensee’s ability to 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition vf relies on its licensees to help preserve the value of its brands although we make every attempt to protect vf’s brands through among other things approval rights over design production processes and quality packaging merchandising distribution advertising and promotion of its products we cannot completely control the use of licensed vf brands by our licensees the misuse of a brand by a licensee could have a material adverse effect on that brand 

vf’s balance sheet includes a significant amount of intangible assets and goodwill a decline in the estimated fair value of an intangible asset or of a business unit could result in an asset impairment charge which would be recorded as an operating loss in vf’s consolidated statement of income 

under current accounting standards we estimate the fair value of acquired assets including intangible assets and assumed liabilities arising from a business acquisition the excess if any of the cost of the acquired business over the fair value of net tangible assets acquired is goodwill the goodwill is then assigned to a business unit or “reporting unit” within vf which depends on whether the acquired business will be operated as a separate business unit or integrated into an existing vf business unit 

at december 2007 vf had approximately 10 billion of trademark intangible assets and 13 billion of goodwill on its balance sheet these assets are not required to be amortized under current accounting rules in addition vf had approximately 05 billion of intangible assets that are being amortized under current accounting rules the combined amounts represent 42 of vf’s total assets and 76 of common stockholders’ equity 

trademark intangible assets that are not amortized and goodwill must be tested for impairment at least annually the impairment test requires us to estimate the fair value of vf’s business units and related intangible assets primarily using discounted cash flow methodologies based on forecasted revenues and cash flows that will be derived from a business unit or trademark intangible assets that are being amortized must be tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value might not be recoverable 

if the carrying value of goodwill or of intangible assets were to exceed its fair value the asset would be written down to its fair value with the impairment loss recognized as a noncash charge in the consolidated statement of income we have not had any significant impairment charges however a future impairment loss could have a material adverse effect on vf’s results of operations and financial condition 

risks applicable to the apparel industry 

vf’s revenues and profits depend on the level of consumer spending for apparel which is sensitive to general economic conditions and other factors affecting consumer confidence 

the apparel industry has historically been subject to cyclical variations and is particularly affected by adverse trends in the general economy the success of vf’s operations depends on consumer spending consumer spending is influenced by a number of factors including actual and perceived economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as unemployment and wages business conditions interest rates energy prices availability of credit and tax rates in the international national regional and local markets where vf’s products are sold any significant deterioration in general economic conditions recession or increases in interest rates could reduce the level of consumer spending and inhibit consumers’ use of credit a significant decline in the securities markets could materially affect consumer confidence the financial condition of vf’s 

  customers and vf’s operating costs through higher contributions to its pension plan in addition natural disasters war terrorist activity or the threat of war or terrorist activity could adversely affect consumer spending and thereby have a material adverse effect on vf’s financial condition and results of operations 

fluctuations in the price availability and quality of raw materials could increase costs and cause service delays 

fluctuations in the price availability and quality of fabrics or other raw materials used by vf in its manufactured apparel could have a material adverse effect on vf’s cost of sales or its ability to meet its customers’ demands the prices for such fabrics depend on demand and market prices for the raw materials used to produce them particularly cotton the price and availability of such raw materials may fluctuate significantly depending on many factors including crop yields and weather patterns in the future vf may not be able to pass all or a portion of such higher raw materials prices on to its customers 

vf’s business is exposed to foreign currency fluctuations 

approximately 28 of vf’s total revenues is derived from international markets vf’s foreign businesses operate in functional currencies other than the us dollar assets liabilities revenues and expenses in these foreign businesses are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in addition vf sources and manufactures most of its products overseas as a result the cost of these products may be affected by changes in the value of the relevant currencies changes in currency exchange rates may also affect the us dollar value of the foreign currency denominated amounts at which vf’s international businesses purchase products incur costs or sell products furthermore vf’s international sales and licensing revenue are derived from sales in foreign currencies although we hedge some exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange rates arising in the ordinary course of business foreign currency fluctuations could have a material adverse impact on vf’s financial condition and results of operations 

vf’s ability to sell products in international markets may be affected by legal regulatory political and economic risks 

our ability to maintain the current level of operations in our existing international markets and to capitalize on growth in new international markets is subject to risks associated with international operations these include the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws and regulations unexpected changes in regulatory requirements new tariffs or other barriers to some international markets 

we cannot predict whether quotas duties taxes or other similar restrictions will be imposed by the united states the european union japan or other countries upon the import or export of our products in the future or what effect any of these actions would have on vf’s business financial condition or results of operations changes in regulatory geopolitical policies and other factors may adversely affect vf’s business or may require us to modify our current business practices

analysis of results of continuing operations consolidated statements of income 

the following table presents a summary of the changes in our total revenues during the last two years 

 

total revenues consist of net sales of products and royalty income from licensees revenues in most of our ongoing businesses increased in 2007 and 2006 due primarily to unit volume increases with the largest growth in our outdoor and jeanswear businesses additional details on revenues are provided in the section titled “information by business segment” 

in translating foreign currencies into the us dollar the weaker us dollar in relation to the functional currencies where vf conducts the majority of its business primarily the european euro countries benefited revenue by 130 million in 2007 relative to 2006 and by 11 million in 2006 relative to 2005 the weighted average translation rate for the euro was 136 per euro during 2007 compared with 125 during 2006 and 2005 with the weakening of the us dollar in recent months reported revenues in 2008 may be positively impacted compared with 2007 

the following table presents the percentage relationship to total revenues for components of our consolidated statements of income 

 

gross margins increased to 435 of revenues in 2007 compared with 434 in 2006 and 432 in 2005 gross margins benefited 03 in 2007 over 2006 from the mix impact of our higher margin lifestyle businesses representing a higher percentage of total revenues the 2007 

  comparison also benefited by 01 due to the special items in 2007 and 2006 higher expense in 2006 discussed in the operating margin section of longterm financial targets above these benefits to 2007 were partially offset by higher levels of distressed sales with lower gross margins in 2007 

gross margins also benefited 04 in 2006 over 2005 as a result of the mix impact resulting from our growing lifestyle businesses this increase was partially offset by the impact of an adjustment in 2005 to reduce certain postemployment benefit accruals in mexico which did not recur in 2006 

today 26 of our total net sales relates to products manufactured in vfowned facilities in mexico europe and central america and 74 relates to products obtained from contractors primarily in asia where we manufacture in vfowned facilities our product costs are lower than any available on a global basis for like products we believe a combination of vfowned and contracted production from different geographic regions provides flexibility and a competitive advantage in our product sourcing 

marketing administrative and general expenses as a percent of revenues were 301 of revenues in 2007 and 2006 and 297 in 2005 this ratio increased 04 in 2007 and 2006 due to a shift in the mix of our businesses toward those with higher expense percentages specifically toward our growing lifestyle branded businesses the 2007 ratio also increased 02 due to the impact of the 2007 acquisitions whose operations have not yet been fully integrated within vf in addition the specific actions discussed in the operating margin section of longterm financial targets above increased this ratio by 02 in 2007 and 01 in 2006 the increases in 2007 and 2006 over the respective prior years were offset by the impact of beneficial revenue growth in many of our businesses resulting in improved leverage of operating expenses 

we include costs of cooperative advertising licensing retail stores and shipping and handling in marketing administrative and general expenses as stated in our significant accounting policies in note a to the consolidated financial statements some other apparel companies classify cooperative advertising costs or licensing costs as a reduction of net sales or royalty income respectively while some classify retail store and shipping and handling costs in cost of goods sold accordingly our gross margins and operating expenses may not be directly comparable with other apparel companies 

interest income increased 33 million in 2007 due to an increase in interest rates and higher cash 

  levels resulting primarily from the timing of the sale of the global intimate apparel business and cash generated from operations interest expense including amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs net of amortization of the gain on an interest rate hedging contract increased 149 million in 2007 due to i higher borrowings needed to fund acquisition activity and ii higher interest rates on shortterm debt interest expense decreased 133 million in 2006 due to lower average interest rates and lower average debt outstanding average interestbearing debt outstanding totaled approximately 1080 million for 2007 900 million for 2006 and 1030 million for 2005 the weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt was 64 for 2007 61 for 2006 and 67 for 2005 

the effective income tax rate was 323 in 2007 compared with 312 in 2006 and 322 in 2005 during 2007 and 2006 we recorded tax benefits of 120 million and 169 million respectively for the favorable audit outcomes on certain tax matters and from expiration of statutes of limitations outside of the united states these benefits lowered our annual tax rates by 13 and 22 respectively the 2005 rate benefited from favorable settlements of prior years’ foreign and state tax returns 

income from continuing operations increased 15 to 6132 million 555 per share in 2007 and by 11 to 5351 million 483 per share in 2006 after considering the effects of discontinued operations and a cumulative effect charge for the change in accounting policy for stockbased compensation in 2005 vf reported net income of 5916 million 522 per share in 2007 5335 million 472 per share in 2006 and 5067 million 444 per share in 2005 in translating foreign currencies into the us dollar the weaker us dollar had a 011 favorable impact on earnings per share in 2007 compared with 2006 and a 002 favorable impact in 2006 compared with 2005 also the 2007 acquisitions added 009 per share to the 2007 results and the reef acquisition acquired in 2005 had a 003 favorable impact to earnings per share in 2006 compared with 2005 

information by business segment 

vf’s businesses are grouped into five product categories and by brands within those product categories for management and internal financial reporting purposes these groupings of businesses are referred to as “coalitions” both management and vf’s board of directors evaluate operating performance at the coalition level these coalitions represent vf’s reportable segments 

for business segment reporting purposes coalition revenues and coalition profit represent net 

  sales royalty income and operating expenses under the direct control of an individual coalition along with amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets and its share of centralized corporate expenses directly related to the coalition corporate expenses not apportioned to the coalitions and net interest expense are excluded from coalition profit importantly this basis of performance evaluation is consistent with that used for management incentive compensation 

see note r to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of our results of operations and other information by coalition along with a reconciliation of coalition profit to income from continuing operations before income taxes coalition results are not necessarily indicative of operating results that would have been reported had each business coalition been an independent standalone entity during the periods presented further vf’s presentation of coalition profit may not be comparable with similar measures used by other companies 

the following table presents a summary of the changes in our total revenues by coalition during the last two years 

 

  jeanswear 

the jeanswear coalition consists of our global jeanswear businesses led by the wrangler â and lee â brands overall jeanswear revenues were up 4 in 2007 and 3 in 2006 domestic jeanswear revenues were flat in 2007 compared with 2006 with a 3 increase in our mass market business offset by slight declines in our lee â and specialty businesses in 2006 domestic jeanswear revenues increased 3 led by the turnaround of the lee â brand which posted a 6 increase over 2005 also our domestic mass market revenues increased by 4 in 2006 these increases were partially offset by the exit of the earl jean business in early 2006 

  jeanswear revenues in international markets including europe canada mexico latin america and asia increased 13 in 2007 over 2006 foreign currency translation positively impacted 2007 jeanswear revenues by 57 million or 6 revenues from the joint venture in india established in september 2006 contributed 3 of the increase revenues increased in all geographic areas in 2007 with the exception of our latin america operations where revenues were flat international jeanswear revenues increased 3 in 2006 over 2005 approximately 2 of the 2006 increase resulted from our joint venture in india revenues increased in all geographic areas in 2006 compared with 2005 other than canada which was flat 

jeanswear coalition operating margins were 166 in 2007 and 155 in 2006 the operating margin improvement in 2007 was attributed to higher gross margins resulting from i growth in our international jeans businesses where gross margins are higher than our domestic businesses ii improved operating efficiencies and iii actions taken in the prior year to reduce product cost and improve product development capabilities jeanswear operating results include expenses of 80 million in 2007 and 145 million in 2006 related to these capacity reduction and other actions which negatively impacted operating margins in those years by 03 and 05 respectively in addition approximately 02 of the improvement in operating margin in 2007 was driven by the gain on the sale of his â trademarks and related intellectual property during 2007 

jeanswear coalition operating margins were 155 in 2006 compared with 168 in 2005 the reduction in margin percentage primarily resulted from the 05 negative impact in 2006 for the capacity reduction and other actions discussed above combined with the impact of reducing mexican postemployment benefit accruals in 2005 06 positive impact in 2005 which management had determined were greater than required under local laws the remaining decline in operating margins in 2006 resulted from increased domestic spending on advertising and investments in retail stores overseas 

  outdoor 

the outdoor coalition consists of vf’s outdoorrelated businesses including the north face â brand apparel footwear and equipment jansport â and eastpak â daypacks and apparel vans â performance and casual footwear and apparel kipling â bags and accessories napapijri â outdoorbased sportswear reef â beachinspired footwear and apparel and eagle creek â adventure travel gear revenues increased 28 in 2007 with 25 organic growth and the remainder from the eagle creek and the north face – china acquisitions the organic growth 

  was led by global unit volume increases and strong consumer demand for our the north face â  vans â  kipling â and napapijri â brands the growth in these brands particularly the north face â and vans â  included geographic expansion opening additional owned retail locations and entering new product categories 

revenues also increased 28 in 2006 primarily through organic growth led by unit volume increases for the north face â and vans â products in the united states and international markets the acquisition of reef also added 47 million to 2006 revenues for the period prior to its acquisition anniversary date revenues in 2007 and 2006 benefited from the favorable effects of foreign currency translation by 73 million and 8 million respectively 

coalition profit increased 31 in 2007 with operating margins increasing to 164 in 2007 from 160 in 2006 the increase was driven by strong revenue growth resulting in improved leverage of operating expenses including distribution and product development also revenue growth was more significant in our international and retail operations where operating margins are typically higher these items were offset by higher levels of distressed sales and additional investments in our retail operations 

coalition profit increased 28 in 2006 consistent with the revenue increase above the operating margins in both 2006 and 2005 for the outdoor coalition were 160 the 2005 acquisition of reef added approximately 5 million or 2 to coalition profit in 2006 

imagewear 

the imagewear coalition includes vf’s occupational industrial career and safety apparel business as well as our licensed apparel business revenues in the occupational apparel business declined 3 as many of our industrial customers continue to internalize their manufacturing this reduction included the impact of exiting our underperforming commodity fleece and tshirt business excluding this business revenues in our occupational apparel business increased slightly in 2007 over 2006 

revenues in the licensed apparel business increased 59 due to the acquisition of majestic which added 156 million to revenues in 2007 excluding the impact of the majestic acquisition licensed apparel revenues increased 6 led by growth in the licensed national football league and major league baseball businesses 

coalition revenues increased 3 in 2006 with occupational apparel revenues increasing 2 and 

  licensed apparel revenues increasing 4 excluding the impact of the phaseout of our underperforming commodity fleece and tshirt business occupational apparel revenues increased 6 in 2006 with increased revenues in industrial career and safety apparel licensed apparel revenues increased 4 in 2006 led by growth in the licensed national football league business 

coalition profit declined to 144 in 2007 from 162 in 2006 resulting from competitive factors impacting the pricing of our new programs within the occupational apparel businesses and the impact of the majestic acquisition which had lower operating margins than imagewear coalition averages 

coalition profit increased 6 in 2006 with substantially all of the growth in licensed sports apparel profits in the occupational apparel business were flat in 2006 compared with 2005 operating margin for the imagewear coalition increased from 157 in 2005 to a record 162 in 2006 resulting from lower advertising costs and lower increases in administrative and other fixed costs in relation to revenue growth 

sportswear 

the sportswear coalition consists of our nautica â lifestyle brand the john varvatos â luxury collection for men and the kipling â brand business in north america whereas the kipling Ò brand is managed as part of the outdoor coalition internationally coalition revenues were flat in 2007 compared with 2006 with a 4 decrease in our nautica â brand revenues offset by doubledigit gains in our john varvatos â and kipling Ò brand businesses the overall decline in nautica revenues resulted from lower menswear business due to challenging conditions in department stores and higher promotional activity in our nautica retail stores in the second half of 2007 this decrease was offset by increased revenues in our nautica â brand women’s sportswear 

coalition revenues increased 5 in 2006 including a 4 increase in our nautica â brand revenues and strong growth in our john varvatos â and kipling Ò brand businesses 

sportswear coalition operating margins declined to 96 in 2007 from 133 in 2006 due to the impact of revenue decreases in the nautica â brand without comparable expense reduction and increased promotional activity in our owned outlet stores and the department store channel in 2007 both 2007 and 2006 include significant investments in our nautica â brand women’s sportswear business operating losses resulting from the nautica â women’s initiative lowered the overall coalition operating 

  margins by approximately 2 in both years 

sportswear coalition operating margins were 133 in 2006 and 154 in 2005 coalition profit declined in 2006 from 2005 primarily due to the investments behind the fall 2006 introduction of the nautica â brand women’s sportswear collection 

contemporary brands 

this coalition was formed in august 2007 with two newly acquired businesses — seven for all mankind and its 7 for all mankind â brand of premium denim jeanswear and related apparel and lucy activewear and its lucy â brand of women’s activewear the contemporary brands coalition operating margin of 175 was driven by the high profitability of seven for all mankind a high gross margin business the lucy activewear business is not currently profitable due to startup costs for new stores and high promotional activity exceeding the earnings contribution of their retail locations with the rollout of additional stores profitability is expected in 2009 

other 

the other business segment includes the vf outlet business unit of companyoperated retail outlet stores in the united states that sell a broad selection of excess quantities of first quality vf products and other branded products revenues and profits of vf products are reported as part of the operating results of the applicable coalitions while revenues and profits of nonvf products primarily women’s intimate apparel childrenswear hosiery underwear and accessories which provide a broader selection of merchandise to attract consumer traffic are reported in this business segment the increase in revenues in 2007 was due to vf outlet’s sale of women’s intimate apparel products obtained from independent suppliers following vf’s sale of its intimate apparel business in april 2007 whereas such revenues prior to april 2007 were reported as part of discontinued operations 

reconciliation of coalition profit to consolidated income from continuing operations before income taxes 

there are two types of costs necessary to reconcile total coalition profit as discussed in the preceding paragraphs to income from continuing operations before income taxes these costs discussed below are interest and corporate and other expenses see also note r to the consolidated financial statements 

interest expense net was discussed in the previous “consolidated statements of income” section interest is excluded from coalition profit because substantially all of our financing costs are managed at the corporate office and are not under the control of coalition management 

  corporate and other expenses consists of corporate headquarters’ and similar costs that are not apportioned to the operating coalitions these expenses are summarized as follows 

 

information systems and shared services – included are costs of our management information systems and our centralized shared services center which includes common financial supply chain human resources and customer management services that support our worldwide operations operating costs of information systems and shared services are charged to the coalitions based on utilization of those services such as minutes of computer processing time number of transactions or number of users costs to develop new computer applications that will be used across vf are not allocated to the coalitions the growth in the information systems and shared services costs in 2007 and 2006 over the 2005 level is related to increased information systems development additions to information technology infrastructure and higher centralized supply and sales chain management costs also a greater proportion of management information systems and other costs were allocated to the coalitions in 2006 and 2007 primarily related to new information system implementations during those periods 

corporate headquarters’ costs – headquarters’ costs include compensation and benefits of corporate management and staff certain legal and professional fees and administrative and general expenses which are not apportioned to the coalitions the increase in these costs from 2006 to 2007 was driven by higher compensation and other costs 

trademark maintenance and enforcement – legal and other costs of registering maintaining and enforcing the majority of vf’s trademarks plus related costs of licensing administration are controlled by a centralized trademark and licensing staff and are not allocated to the coalitions 

  other – this category includes i adjustments to convert the earnings of certain business units using the fifo inventory valuation method for internal reporting to the lifo method for consolidated financial reporting ii miscellaneous costs that result from corporate programs or corporatemanaged decisions that are not allocated to the business units for internal management reporting and iii other consolidating adjustments 

analysis of financial condition 

balance sheets 

accounts receivable increased 20 in 2007 due to a 22 increase in fourth quarter revenues over 2006 and slight improvement in our days’ sales outstanding 

inventories increased by 19 in 2007 over the prior year inventories increased by i 13 due to the impact of the 2007 acquisitions ii 3 from the effects of a weaker us dollar and iii 3 due to higher levels of inventory in our organic businesses 

property plant and equipment increased in 2007 due to the 2007 acquisitions and capital spending in 2007 exceeding depreciation expense by 19 million capital spending in 2007 supported the growth of our businesses and specifically included an increased level of spending to support new retail store rollouts 

intangible assets and goodwill each increased in 2007 due to the 2007 acquisitions and the impact of foreign currency translation a weaker us dollar other assets increased in 2007 due to i the recognition of a 27 million pension asset for the overfunded status of our qualified defined benefit pension plan in accordance with fasb statement no 158 employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans “statement 158” and ii an increase in assets held under deferred compensation plans see notes b g h and i to the consolidated financial statements 

in october 2007 vf entered into a 10 billion domestic senior unsecured committed revolving bank credit agreement that supports issuance of up to 10 billion in commercial paper this agreement replaced a similar 750 million agreement also in october 2007 certain international subsidiaries with vf as guarantor entered into a € 2500 million us dollar equivalent of 3679 million international senior unsecured committed revolving bank credit agreement which also replaced a similar € 1750 million agreement 

  shortterm borrowings at december 2007 included 927 million outstanding under the international credit agreement shortterm borrowings at december 2007 were higher than december 2006 because a portion of the 2006 borrowings under the international credit agreement were classified as longterm debt because it was expected to remain outstanding for at least 12 months 

accounts payable increased in 2007 compared with 2006 due to higher inventory levels and the timing of inventory purchases and the related vendor payments at fiscal yearend accrued liabilities increased in 2007 due to the 2007 acquisitions and higher incentive compensation accruals 

longterm debt increased from 2006 to 2007 due to the issuance of 6000 million of senior notes in october 2007 see note o to the consolidated financial statements offset by payment of a note related to the nautica acquisition and payment of amounts classified in 2006 as longterm under the international credit agreement 

other liabilities increased due to an increase in deferred tax liabilities arising from foreign currency translation offset in part by an improvement in the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans in accordance with statement 158 this standard effective for december 2006 requires that the funded status of a defined benefit plan measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and projected benefit obligations be recorded in the balance sheet at the end of 2006 an unfunded pension liability of 1438 million was recorded in other liabilities this longterm liability decreased to 744 million at the end of 2007 due primarily to actuarial gains arising from an increase in the discount rate and favorable investment returns on plan assets 

see note n for a discussion of asset liability and equity balances related to defined benefit pension plans in vf’s 2007 and 2006 consolidated balance sheets 

liquidity and cash flows 

the financial condition of vf is reflected in the following 

   

for the ratio of debt to total capital debt is defined as shortterm and longterm borrowings and total capital is defined as debt plus common stockholders’ equity our ratio of net debt to total capital with net debt defined as debt less cash and equivalents was 211 at the end of 2007 

vf’s primary source of liquidity is its strong cash flow provided by operating activities cash flow from operating activities of continuing operations which was 8336 million in 2007 4541 million in 2006 and 5337 million in 2005 is primarily dependent on the level of income from continuing operations and changes in investments in inventories and other working capital components income from continuing operations was 6132 million 5351 million and 4826 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively income from continuing operations in each year included noncash stockbased compensation expense of 624 million 464 million and 405 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively also we did not make a discretionary contribution to our qualified defined benefit pension plan in 2007 because our qualified plan was fully funded based on projected benefit obligations while operating cash flows included discretionary contributions of 750 million in 2006 and 550 million in 2005 

the net change in operating asset and liability components was a cash usage of 42 million in 2007 compared with cash usage of 2006 million in 2006 and 1097 million in 2005 much of the improvement in this area was due to a specific focus on working capital leverage by management at the end of 2007 major reasons for changes in the yeartoyear cash impact from operating asset and liability accounts in 2007 compared with 2006 included i higher than normal accounts receivable at the end of 2006 resulting from very strong international sales near the end of the year to customers with longer payment terms ii unusually low accounts payable at the end of 2006 due to the timing of inventory receipts and iii unusually high accrued income taxes at the beginning of 2006 due to required tax payments for the prior year 

to finance its ongoing operations and most unusual circumstances that may arise vf anticipates 

  relying upon continued future strong cash generation in addition vf has significant existing liquidity from its available cash balances and debt capacity supported by its strong credit rating at the end of 2007 9899 million was available for borrowing under vf’s 10 billion senior unsecured committed revolving bank credit facility with 101 million of standby letters of credit issued under the agreement also at the end of 2007 2752 million was available for borrowing under vf’s € 2500 million us dollar equivalent of 3679 million senior unsecured committed international revolving bank credit facility 

we paid cash of 10606 million 393 million and 2118 million for acquisitions in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively net of cash balances in the acquired companies the 2007 acquisitions were funded with existing vf cash balances shortterm commercial paper borrowings and bank borrowings commercial paper borrowings were repaid from proceeds of the longterm notes issued in october 2007 and cash flows from operations in addition we received 3487 million in proceeds from the sale of our intimate apparel business in 2007 

capital expenditures were 1139 million in 2007 compared with 1272 million and 1030 million in 2006 and 2005 respectively capital expenditures in each of these years primarily related to retail and distribution as well as maintenance spending across our global manufacturing network we expect that capital spending could reach 145 million in 2008 with the increase related to higher retail store investments capital spending will be funded by cash flow from operations 

during 2007 vf received 5920 million in proceeds from the issuance of 595 senior notes due in 2017 and 645 senior notes due in 2037 vf repaid 781 million under the international bank credit agreements in 2007 and a 330 million note related to the nautica acquisition in each of 2007 and 2006 during 2005 vf repaid 4013 million of longterm debt at scheduled maturity dates see notes j and l to the consolidated financial statements 

in october 2007 standard  poor’s ratings services affirmed its ‘a minus’ corporate credit rating ‘a2’ commercial paper rating and ‘stable’ outlook for vf standard  poor’s also assigned its ‘a minus’ senior unsecured debt rating to vf’s 6000 million unsecured senior notes issued in october 2007 in august 2007 moody’s investors service affirmed vf’s longterm debt rating of ‘a3’ commercial paper rating of ‘prime2’ and ‘stable’ outlook existing longterm debt agreements do not contain acceleration of maturity clauses based solely on changes in credit ratings however for the 6000 million of senior notes issued in 2007 if there were a change in control of vf and as a result of the change in control  the notes were rated below investment 

  grade by recognized rating agencies then vf would be obligated to repurchase the notes at 101 of the aggregate principal amount of notes repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest 

during 2007 vf purchased 41 million shares of its common stock in open market transactions at a cost of 3500 million average price of 8503 using the proceeds from the sale of our intimate apparel business and in 2006 purchased 20 million shares at a cost of 1186 million average price of 5929 per share in addition vf purchased 40 million shares of its common stock in 2005 at a cost of 2290 million average price of 5725 per share the primary objective of our share repurchase program is to offset on a longterm basis dilution caused by awards under equity compensation plans under its current authorization from the board of directors vf may purchase an additional 52 million shares the company expects to repurchase 20 million shares in 2008 we will continue to evaluate future share repurchases considering funding required to support business acquisitions our common stock price and levels of stock option exercises 

cash dividends totaled 223 per common share in 2007 compared with 194 in 2006 and 110 in 2005 our dividend payout rate was 427 in 2007 compared with payout rates of 411 in 2006 and 242 in 2005 going forward we expect to pay dividends of approximately 40 of our diluted earnings per share the current indicated annual dividend rate for 2008 is 232 per share 

following is a summary of vf’s contractual obligations and commercial commitments at the end of 2008 that will require the use of funds 

 

   

 we have other financial commitments at the end of 2007 that are not included in the above table but may require the use of funds under certain circumstances 

 

   

during 2007 vf met its obligations when due by issuing commercial paper for operating activities borrowing under a shortterm bank facility issuing 6000 million principal amount of publicly traded notes and entering into new domestic and international credit agreements on terms substantially similar to its previous agreements credit market conditions and the general contraction of liquidity in the united states and global capital markets during the last half of 2007 caused by subprime mortgage risk exposures did not have a significant impact on vf management believes that vf’s cash balances and funds provided by operating activities as well as unused committed bank credit lines additional borrowing capacity and access to equity markets taken as a whole provide i adequate liquidity to meet all of its current and longterm obligations when due ii adequate liquidity to fund capital expenditures and to maintain our dividend payout policy and iii flexibility to meet investment opportunities that may arise 

we do not participate in transactions with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships established to facilitate offbalance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes 

risk management 

vf is exposed to a variety of market risks in the ordinary course of business and we regularly assess these potential risks we manage our exposures to these risks through our operating and financing activities and when appropriate by taking advantage of naturally offsetting exposures within vf or by creating offsetting positions through the use of derivative financial instruments derivative financial instruments are contracts whose value is based on or “derived” from changes in the value of an underlying currency exchange rate interest rate or other financial asset or index we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

we limit the risk of interest rate fluctuations on net income and cash flows by managing our mix of fixed and variable interest rate debt in addition we may also use derivative financial instruments to minimize our interest rate risk since all of our longterm debt has fixed interest rates our primary interest rate exposure relates to changes in interest rates on variable rate borrowings which averaged approximately 396 million during 2007 however any change in interest rates would also affect interest income earned on vf’s cash equivalents on deposit based on average amounts of borrowings having variable interest rates and cash on deposit during 2007 the effect of a hypothetical 10 change in interest rates on reported net income 

  would not be material 

vf is a global enterprise subject to the risk of foreign currency fluctuations approximately 28 of our revenues in 2007 were generated in international markets substantially all of our foreign businesses operate in functional currencies other than the us dollar assets and liabilities in these foreign businesses are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates during 2007 we entered into a new international bank credit agreement that provides for eurodenominated borrowings at the end of 2007 euro borrowings under this agreement totaled € 63 million 927 million which reduces exposure to currency rate changes for our eurodenominated net assets net advances to our foreign businesses primarily in europe latin american and asia are considered to be longterm and accordingly foreign currency translation effects on those net assets are deferred as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in common stockholders’ equity we do not hedge these net investments and do not hedge the translation of foreign currency operating results into the us dollar 

we monitor net foreign currency market exposures and may in the ordinary course of business enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge the effects of exchange rate fluctuations for specific foreign currency transactions or a portion of our anticipated foreign currency cash flows use of these financial instruments allows us to reduce the overall exposure to exchange rate movements on vf’s us dollar cash flows since gains and losses on these contracts will offset losses and gains on the transactions or cash flows being hedged our practice is to hedge a portion of our net foreign currency cash flows anticipated during the following 12 months relating to crossborder inventory purchases production costs product sales and intercompany royalty payments by buying or selling us dollar contracts against various currencies although vf is exposed to risk of loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to these foreign exchange contracts we believe these counterparties are creditworthy financial institutions and do not anticipate nonperformance 

if there were a hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates of 10 compared with rates at the end of 2007 the expected effect on the change in fair value of the hedging contracts outstanding would result in an unrealized loss of approximately 30 million based on changes in the timing and amount of foreign currency exchange rate movements the actual unrealized loss could differ however any such change in the fair value of the hedging contracts would also result in an offsetting change in the value of the underlying transactions or anticipated cash flows being hedged 

  vf is exposed to market risks for the pricing of cotton and other fibers which indirectly impacts fabric prices we manage our fabric prices by obtaining fixed price commitments for denim and other fabrics in some cases for up to one year in advance vf has not historically managed nor do we currently intend to manage commodity price exposures by using derivative instruments 

vf has nonqualified deferred compensation plans in which liabilities accrued for the plans’ participants are based on market values of investment funds that are selected by the participants the risk of changes in the market values of the participants’ investment selections is hedged by vf’s investment in a portfolio of securities that substantially mirrors the investment selections underlying the deferred compensation liabilities increases and decreases in deferred compensation liabilities are substantially offset by corresponding increases and decreases in the market value of vf’s investments resulting in a negligible net exposure to our operating results and financial position 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to accurately and fairly report vf’s operating results and financial position in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states we apply these accounting policies in a consistent manner our significant accounting policies are summarized in note a to the consolidated financial statements 

the application of these accounting policies requires that we make estimates and assumptions about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses contingent assets and liabilities and related disclosures these estimates assumptions and judgments are based on historical experience current trends and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances we evaluate these estimates and assumptions and may retain outside consultants to assist in our evaluation in areas such as allocation of the purchase price of acquired businesses equity compensation pension benefits and selfinsured liabilities because our business cycle is relatively short ie from the date that we place an order for inventory until that inventory is sold and the trade receivable is collected actual results related to most of these estimates are known within a few months after any balance sheet date if actual results ultimately differ from previous estimates the revisions are included in results of operations in the period in which the actual amounts become known 

we believe the following accounting policies involve the most significant estimates assumptions 

  and management judgments used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements or are the most sensitive to change from outside factors we have discussed the application of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 

inventories 

our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value cost includes all material labor and overhead costs incurred to manufacture or purchase the finished goods overhead allocated to manufactured product is based on the normal capacity of our plants and does not include amounts related to idle capacity or abnormal production inefficiencies market value is based on a detailed review in each business unit at least quarterly of all inventories on the basis of individual styles or individual stylesizecolor stockkeeping units “skus” to identify slow moving or excess products discontinued and tobediscontinued products and offquality merchandise this review matches inventory on hand plus current production and purchase commitments with current and expected future sales orders for those units in inventory that are identified as slowmoving or excess quantities we estimate their market value based on historical experience and current realization trends this evaluation performed using a systematic and consistent methodology requires forecasts of future demand market conditions and selling prices if the forecasted market value on an individual style or sku basis is less than cost we provide an allowance to reflect the lower value of that inventory this methodology recognizes inventory exposures on an individual style or sku basis at the time such losses are evident rather than at the time goods are actually sold historically these estimates of future demand and selling prices have not varied significantly from actual results due to our timely identification and rapid disposal of these reduced value inventories 

physical inventory counts are taken on a regular basis we provide for estimated inventory losses that have likely occurred since the last physical inventory date historically our physical inventory shrinkage has not been significant 

longlived assets 

we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to the underlying tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values with any excess purchase price recorded as goodwill the process of assigning fair values particularly to acquired intangible assets is highly subjective as the fair value assessments are based on forecasts of future cash flows we use the same assumptions of future cash flows for assigning fair values to these assets that we used for evaluation of the business acquisition 

  our depreciation policies for property plant and equipment and our amortization policies for definitelived intangible assets reflect judgments on the estimated economic lives of these assets specifically for customerrelated intangible assets we review historical attrition patterns for various groups of customers and for licenserelated intangible assets we review historical trends and expected license renewal rates we review these assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable we measure recoverability of the carrying value of these assets by comparison with estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets this review requires estimates and assumptions about the forecasted amount and duration of future cash flows and residual value if any attributable to the assets being tested these evaluations have not resulted in any significant impairment charges during the past three years 

we evaluate indefinitelived trademark intangible assets and goodwill in all business units at least annually or more frequently if there is an indication of possible impairment we measure recoverability of the carrying value of intangible assets by comparison with the fair value of the indefinitelived trademark the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill is assessed by comparing the book value of the underlying business to its fair value since fair value is generally based on discounted cash flows it requires management’s assumptions and judgment regarding business strategies future revenues and profitability and a discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in those future cash flows 

if the estimated fair value of a business reporting unit were to decline or if we were to decide to discontinue use of a trademark or to dispose of a business we may be exposed to an impairment charge which could be material related to intangible assets or goodwill for each of the last three years the indicated fair value of the indefinitelived trademark assets and goodwill in the business units exceeded the respective carrying amount of those assets for the reporting unit whose estimated fair value was closest in dollar terms to its carrying value the estimated fair value exceeded its respective carrying value by approximately 18 

stock options 

since our adoption of statement 123r in 2005 we have been using a lattice optionpricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees and nonemployee members of the board of directors we believe that a lattice model provides a refined estimate of the fair value of options because it can incorporate i historical patterns and future assumptions about the exercise of stock options for each of several groups of option holders in relation to changes in the price of vf common stock and ii inputs that vary over time such as 

  assumptions for interest rates and volatility we performed a rigorous review of all assumptions and believe that the assumptions employed in each valuation are reflective of our outstanding options and underlying common stock and of our groups of option participants our lattice valuation is based on the assumptions listed in note p to the consolidated financial statements 

one of the critical assumptions in the valuation process is estimating the expected average life of the options before exercise in each year we based our estimates on evaluations of the historical and expected option exercise patterns for each of several groups of option holders that have historically exhibited different option exercise patterns these evaluations included i voluntary stock option exercise patterns based on a combination of changes in the price of vf common stock and periods of time that options are outstanding before exercise and ii involuntary exercise patterns resulting from turnover retirement and mortality 

volatility is another critical assumption requiring judgment in each year we based our estimate of future volatility on a combination of implied and historical volatility implied volatility was based on shortterm up to 6 – 9 months publicly traded nearthemoney options on vf common stock we measured historical volatility over a ten year period corresponding to the contractual term of the options using daily stock price observations our assumption for valuation purposes was that expected volatility starts at a level equal to the implied volatility and then transitions to the historical volatility over the remainder of the ten year option term 

pension obligations 

vf sponsors defined benefit pension plans as a key retirement benefit for most domestic employees employed on or before december 31 2004 the selection of appropriate actuarial assumptions for determination of our accumulated and projected pension benefit liabilities and of our annual pension expense is significant due to the long time period over which benefits are accrued and paid we review annually the principal economic actuarial assumptions summarized in note n to the consolidated financial statements and modify them based on current rates and trends we update annually participant demographics and the amount and timing of benefit payments we also periodically review and modify as necessary other plan assumptions such as rates of retirement termination disability and mortality specifically during 2006 we updated the assumptions for future compensation increases retirement and turnover and during 2005 we updated the mortality assumption to a version of the rp 2000 mortality table that includes a provision for improvements in life expectancy through 2015 we believe these assumptions are reflective of the employee base covered by the plans and result in 

  the best estimate of the plans’ future experience actual results may vary from the actuarial assumptions used 

one of the critical assumptions used in the actuarial model is the discount rate the discount rate is used to estimate the present value of our accumulated and projected benefit obligations at each valuation date we adjust as necessary our discount rate assumption at each annual valuation date based on current market interest rates we select our discount rate based on matching high quality corporate bond yields to the projected benefit payments and duration of obligations for participants in our pension plans we use the population of us corporate bonds rated ‘aa’ by moody’s investors service approximately 500 such bonds that are noncallable or with makewhole provisions and exclude the highest and lowest yielding bonds the plans’ projected benefit payments are matched to spot interest rates over the expected payment period and a present value is developed that produces a single equivalent discount rate that recognizes our plans’ distinct liability characteristics we believe our 2007 discount rate of 640 appropriately reflects current market conditions and the longterm nature of projected benefit payments to participants in our pension plans the discount rate for our plans may be higher than rates used for plans at some other companies because of our plans’ higher percentage of female participants with a longer life expectancy and higher percentage of inactive participants who will not begin receiving vested benefits for many years 

another critical assumption of the actuarial model is the expected longterm rate of return on investment assets in our pension trust our investment objective is to maximize the longterm return on a diversified portfolio of assets at an acceptable level of risk the rate of return is the weighted average of expected longterm asset return assumptions for the various classes of assets held by the plan return assumptions are based on several factors including the mix of investment assets historic and projected market returns by asset class and current market conditions our rate of return assumption was 825 in 2007 and 2006 and 850 in 2005 which were less than our actual compounded annual return over the preceding 15 years during 2008 the target mix of investment assets will be altered with part of the change being to increase the portion of fixed income investments and to lengthen the average duration of those investments to more closely match expected benefit payments the purpose of this change in plan investments is to better match the effect of interest rate changes on the value of our plan’s investment assets with the benefit obligations they are intended to fund thereby reducing the yeartoyear variability of our plan’s funded status and resulting pension expense based on these planned 

  changes in investment mix an evaluation of market conditions and projected market returns we will be lowering the rate of return assumption to 800 for 2008 

the sensitivity of changes in valuation assumptions on our annual pension expense and on our plans’ projected benefit obligations “pbo” all other factors being equal is illustrated by the following 

 

differences between actual results and actuarial assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods during the last several years actual results have differed significantly from actuarial assumptions resulting in 872 of accumulated net unrecognized actuarial losses at our 2007 valuation date these accumulated losses arose primarily because i our pension plan liabilities increased substantially as a result of the overall decline in the discount rate from 75 in 2001 to 64 in 2007 and ii while our actual investment return on pension plan assets exceeded the actuarially assumed rate in the last three years significant investment losses were incurred in 2002 and 2001 due to the overall decline in the securities markets our policy is to amortize unrecognized actuarial gains and losses to pension expense as follows amounts in excess of 20 of pbo at the beginning of the year are amortized over five years amounts totaling 10 to 20 of pbo are amortized over the expected average remaining service of active participants and amounts totaling less than 10 of the lower of investment assets or pbo at the beginning of the year are not amortized 

the cost of pension benefits earned by our covered employees commonly called “service cost” has averaged 214 million per year over the last three years pension expense recognized in our financial statements was 131 million in 2007 375 million in 2006 and 351 million in 2005 expense in each of 2006 and 2005 was significantly higher than the average annual service cost because those years included a significant cost component for amortization of accumulated net 

  unrecognized actuarial losses as discussed in the preceding paragraph our pension expense for 2007 decreased significantly due to reduced amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses and increased plan investment assets arising from discretionary funding contributions of 750 million and 550 million in 2006 and 2005 respectively and improved investment performance our pension expense for 2008 is expected to be comparable to the 2007 level 

in our qualified defined benefit pension plan the fair value of plan assets exceeded projected benefit obligations which resulted in a 274 million pension asset at our most recent valuation date our unfunded supplemental defined benefit plan resulted in a 775 million pension liability the funded status of our plans recognized in our consolidated balance sheets could change significantly in future years depending on securities market fluctuations interest rates and the level of vf contributions to the qualified plan 

effective december 31 2004 vf’s domestic defined benefit plans were amended to close the existing plans to new entrants the amendments did not affect the benefits of current plan participants or their accrual of future benefits domestic employees hired after that date plus employees at certain acquired businesses not covered by those plans now participate in a new defined contribution arrangement with vf contributing amounts based on a percentage of eligible compensation funds contributed under this new benefit arrangement are invested as directed by the participants this defined contribution feature did not have a significant effect on our pension expense or total retirement benefit expense over the last three years however over a period of years the expense of our defined benefit plans is expected to decline as a percentage of our total retirement benefit expense and the yeartoyear variability of our retirement benefit expense should decrease 

income taxes 

vf’s income tax returns are regularly examined by federal state and foreign tax authorities these audits may result in proposed adjustments we have reviewed all issues raised upon examination as well as any exposure for issues that may be raised in future examinations we have evaluated these potential issues under the “morelikelythannot” standard of fasb interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes – an interpretation of fasb statement no 109  a tax position is recognized if it meets this standard and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized such judgments and estimates may change based on audit settlements court cases and interpretation of tax laws and regulations to the extent we prevail in a tax position or when the statute of limitations expires for a tax position for which accruals have been established or to the extent we are required to 

  pay amounts greater than established accruals our income tax expense could be materially affected in the period of resolution we do not currently anticipate any material impact on earnings from the ultimate resolution of income tax uncertainties there are no accruals for general or unknown tax expenses 

we have recorded deferred income tax assets related to operating loss and capital loss carryforwards realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income in specific jurisdictions the amount and timing of which are uncertain possible changes in tax laws and tax planning strategies if in our judgment it appears that we will not be able to generate sufficient taxable income or capital gains to offset losses during the carryforward periods we have recorded valuation allowances to reduce those deferred tax assets to amounts expected to be ultimately realized an adjustment to income tax expense would be required in a future period if we determine that the amount of deferred tax assets to be realized differs from the net recorded amount 

we have not provided us income taxes on a portion of our foreign subsidiaries’ undistributed earnings because we intend to invest those earnings indefinitely if we were to decide to remit those earnings to the united states in a future period our provision for income taxes could increase in that period 

the balance sheet classifications and amounts of accrued income taxes related to assets and liabilities of acquired companies were based on assumptions that could change depending on the ultimate resolution of certain tax matters since these income tax accruals were established in the allocation of the purchase price of acquired businesses future changes in these amounts could result in adjustments to goodwill

we generally target a vf brand to specific groups of consumers within specific channels of distribution vf’s diverse portfolio of brands and products serves consumers shopping in specialty stores department stores national chains and mass merchants in addition many products are sold directly to consumers through vfoperated retail stores as well as monobrand retail stores operated by independent parties a global company 

  vf derives 26 of its revenues from outside the united states primarily in europe canada latin america and the far east with vf products sold in certain geographic areas through our licensees and distributors to provide these products across numerous channels of distribution in different geographic areas we have implemented a strategy that combines efficient and flexible internallyowned manufacturing with sourcing of finished goods from independent contractors 

as part of our strategic plan to shift vf’s portfolio mix to higher growth higher margin lifestyle brands management and the board of directors decided in late 2006 to dispose of the women’s intimate apparel business on january 22 2007 vf entered into a definitive agreement to sell the business this business included all of vf’s domestic and international women’s intimate apparel business units which are being separately reported as discontinued operations in this annual report intimate apparel products include bras panties daywear shapewear and sleepwear in the united states intimate apparel products are sold in department and midtier stores under the vanity fair Ò and lily of france Ò brands and in discount stores under the vassarette Ò  bestform Ò  curvation Ò and licensed ilusion Ò brands certain of these brands are marketed in mexico and canada through joint ventures in which vf maintains a controlling interest in the european market women’s intimate apparel is marketed to department and specialty stores under the lou â  bolero â  gemma â  intima cherry â  vanity fair â and belcor â brands and in discount stores under the variance â  vassarette â and bestform â brands

the following table summarizes vf’s primary owned and licensed brands by coalition 

   

financial information regarding vf’s coalitions as well as geographic information and sales by product category are included in note r to the consolidated financial statements which are included as part of item 8 of this report 

jeanswear coalition 

jeanswear and related shirts and casual products are marketed in the united states and in many international markets the largest of these brands the lee â   and wrangler â brands have longstanding traditions as authentic american jeans brands as they were established in 1889 and 1947 respectively and have strong market positions lee â   and wrangler â products are sold in nearly every developed country in fact including all of its jeanswear brands vf sells more jeans than any other company in the world 

in addition to these brands vf markets the wrangler hero â  rustler â and riders â brands in the united states these brands have continued to grow despite significant competitive activity and retail consolidation in the discount channel of distribution knit and woven tops have helped to extend these brands we also market cotton casual pants under the lee casuals â  timber creek by wrangler â and wrangler â khakis brands 

in domestic markets lee â products are sold through department stores midtier stores and specialty stores wrangler â westernwear is marketed through western specialty stores the wrangler hero â  rustler â and 

  riders â brands are marketed to mass merchant and regional discount stores overall vf’s jeans brands are positioned in the us marketplace where there is significant volume and less fashion risk 

we believe our vendor managed inventory and retail floor space management initiatives with several of our major retailer customers give us a competitive advantage in our domestic jeanswear business we receive pointofsale information from these customers on a daily basis on an individual store and stylesizecolor stockkeeping unit “sku” level we then replenish their retail selling space based on that data to ensure their selling floors are well stocked our systems capabilities allow us to analyze sales data and work with our customers to maximize the assortment and stock inventory levels of our products on their selling floor for our retail customers this leads to higher sales of our products along with lower inventory levels and fewer outofstock skus 

jeanswear in most international markets is more fashionoriented and has a higher relative price than similar products in the united states the jeans market internationally is also more fragmented than in the us with competitors ranging from global brands to a number of smaller brands sold in single country or regional markets 

vf’s largest international jeanswear business is located in western europe lee â  wrangler â and his â jeanswear products are sold through department stores and specialty stores while the hero by wrangler â  maverick â and old axe â products are sold to hypermarket and discount stores we also market the lee â and wrangler â products to mass market and specialty stores in canada and mexico as well as to department stores and specialty stores in south america through businesses based in chile brazil argentina and peru in many international markets we are expanding our marketing of jeans products through vfoperated retail stores an increasingly important vehicle for presenting our brands’ image and marketing story directly to consumers 

lee â products are also manufactured and marketed in spain and portugal through a 50owned joint venture we are continuing to expand our jeanswear brands into emerging markets such as china and russia and in 2006 entered into a majorityowned joint venture to design and market vfbranded products in india including the lee â and wrangler â brands in foreign markets where vf does not have owned operations lee â and wrangler â jeanswear and related products are marketed through distributors agents or licensees 

we believe our jeanswear brands can continue to grow by extending into additional categories and geographies and by investing more heavily in marketing programs that enhance the brands’ equity and stimulate consumer buying

we expect continued healthy growth in our outdoor business as we acquire additional activitybased lifestyle brands acquire certain of our international licensees and distributors launch new product categories open additional retail stores and expand geographically 

  imagewear coalition

the imagewear coalition also markets corporate image uniforms and casual apparel to selected national accounts through the internet we operate over 30 catalog web sites for major business customers eg fedex corporation air canada continental airlines and american airlines and governmental organizations eg us customs and border protection transportation security administration national park service new york city fire department and new york city transit authority these secure web sites give more than 600000 employees of these customers the convenience of shopping and paying for their work and career apparel via the internet

we believe that imagewear’s ability to manage a complex mix of products with very short lead times and at superior service levels can be leveraged to support continued growth in both existing and new businesses 

sportswear coalition 

the nautica â brand is the principal lifestyle brand of the sportswear coalition nautica â sportswear is marketed in the department store and specialty store channels of distribution with approximately onehalf of wholesale sales to federated department stores inc 

the principal nautica â product line is men’s sportswear noted for its classic styling the nautica jeans company â   line features fashionable jeanswear and related tops for younger male consumers other product lines sold under the nautica â   brand include men’s outerwear underwear swimwear and sleepwear and women’s sleepwear and panties a collection of women’s sportswear was launched in a limited number of department store doors in fall 2006 with an expanded rollout planned for 2007 

  vf sportswear operates more than 125 nautica â retail outlet stores in better outlet malls across the united states these stores carry nautica â merchandise for men boys and girls the product styles sold in the outlet stores are different from the nautica â styles sold to department and specialty store wholesale customers in addition these outlet stores carry nautica â merchandise from licensees to complete their product assortment 

the john varvatos â brand is a luxury apparel and accessories collection for men including tailored clothing sportswear leather accessories and footwear these products are sold through upscale department and specialty stores as well as through five showcase john varvatos â retail locations this business is 80 owned by vf with the balance owned by mr john varvatos 

the sportswear coalition also includes the kipling â business in north america  kipling â bags and accessories are marketed to department stores and through vfoperated retail stores 

we believe there is growth potential in the nautica Ò brand particularly in the women’s sportswear category and in retail expansion and significant growth potential in the john varvatos Ò and kipling Ò brands 

directtoconsumer operations 

vfoperated retail stores are an integral part of our strategy for building vf’s brands our full price retail stores allow us to showcase a brand’s full line of current season products with fixturing and imagery that support the brand’s positioning these stores provide high visibility for our brands and products and enable us to stay close to the needs and preferences of consumers we believe the proper presentation of these products in our retail stores enhances our business with our wholesale customers in addition outlet stores serve an important role in our overall inventory management by allowing vf to effectively sell a significant portion of discontinued and outofseason products at better prices than are otherwise available from outside parties while maintaining the integrity of our brands 

our global retail operations comprise approximately 460 stores that sell specific brands such as the north face â  vans â  napapijri â  kipling â  nautica â  lee â or wrangler â  some of these retail stores offer products at full price with the remainder being outlets offering products at discounted prices we plan to open 75  100 new retail stores during 2007 in addition to these monobrand retail and outlet operations we operate 78 vf outlet stores across the united states that sell a broad selection of vf products sales and profits of vf products sold through vf outlet stores are reported as part of the operating results of the respective coalitions 

certain of our brands such as lee â jeanswear and vans â footwear are sold directly to consumers via the internet in many of our other web sites we provide information about our brands and products and visitors are directed to vf’s wholesale customers for purchase of our products in addition our imagewear coalition operates a number of catalog web sites where employees of several national corporate and governmental accounts can purchase their uniforms and other casual apparel these internet sales represented approximately 2 of consolidated total revenues in 2006 total retail and internet sales directly to consumers accounted for approximately 16 and 14 of vf’s consolidated total revenues in 2006 and 2005 respectively we expect our retail business to continue to grow and are planning a capital investment of approximately 45 million for improvements fixtures and equipment in new retail space during 2007 

in addition to our direct to consumer venues we have granted the right to sell several of our brands through over 200 independentlyoperated monobrand retail stores located primarily in europe and asia our products are also sold through concession stores or shops in europe and asia where dedicated retail space is owned or leased by a department store or other independent party but the inventory is owned by vf 

  licensing arrangements 

as part of our business strategy of expanding market penetration of owned brands we enter into licensing agreements for certain apparel and complementary product categories in specific geographic regions if such arrangements with independent parties can provide more effective manufacturing distribution and marketing of such products than could be achieved internally these licensing arrangements relate to a broad range of vf brands and are for fixed terms that may include renewal options in addition certain licensees and distributors have been granted the right to open retail stores under the licensed brand name and sell only licensed branded products in these stores each licensee pays royalties to vf based on its sales of branded products with most agreements providing for a minimum royalty these payments generally range from 5 to 7 of the licensing partners’ net sales of the licensed products gross royalty income was 78 million and 72 million in 2006 and 2005 respectively 

in addition licensees are generally required to spend a specified amount ranging from 1 to 5 of their sales to advertise vf’s products in some cases these advertising amounts are remitted to vf for advertising on behalf of the licensees we provide support to these business partners and seek to preserve the integrity of brand names by taking an active role in the design quality control advertising marketing and distribution of each licensed product most of which are subject to our prior approval and continuing oversight 

licensing activities exist in all coalitions the nautica Ò brand is the largest contributor to licensing revenue representing approximately 45 of gross royalty income the nautica â   brand is licensed in the united states for apparel categories not produced by vf eg tailored clothing dress shirts neckwear women’s swimwear accessories such as fragrances watches eyewear and for nonapparel categories eg furniture bedroom and bathroom linens in addition nautica â apparel and certain nonapparel products are licensed for sale in over 60 countries outside the us wholesale sales of such nautica â licensed products total approximately 475 million annually 

vf has also entered into license agreements to use thirdparty trademarks apparel is marketed under licenses granted by the national football league major league baseball the national hockey league nascar and harleydavidson motor company inc some of these license arrangements contain minimum annual licensing and advertising requirements some are for a short term and may not contain specific renewal options 

we believe that the loss of any license with vf as either licensor or licensee would not have a material adverse affect on vf 

manufacturing and sourcing 

product design and merchandising functions are carried out by a skilled staff located at each of the operating coalitions 

our domestic jeanswear and imagewear businesses operate owned manufacturing facilities primarily cutting sewing and finishing principally located in mexico and central america our international jeanswear businesses operate manufacturing facilities located in poland turkey and malta for these owned production plants we purchase raw materials from numerous domestic and international suppliers for scheduled production raw materials include fabrics made from cotton synthetics and blends of cotton and synthetic yarn as well as thread and trim product identification buttons zippers and snaps in most cases purchased fabric is cut and sewn into finished apparel and in limited cases we contract the sewing of vfowned raw materials into finished product to independent contractors in mexico and central america while in some cases we have obtained fixed price commitments for up to one year specific purchase obligations with suppliers are typically limited to the succeeding two to six months we do not have any longterm supplier contracts for the purchase of raw materials or finished products except for a commitment in connection with the sale of vf’s childrenswear business in 2004 to purchase a remaining total of approximately 111 million of finished product for sale through our vf outlet stores with a minimum of 15 million per year no single supplier represents more than 4 of our total cost of sales 

  over the last several years vf has shifted production from the united states to lower cost locations as a result of this shift in sourcing approximately 32 of our domestic net sales in 2006 were manufactured in vfowned facilities primarily in mexico and central america and 67 were obtained from contractors primarily in asia similarly european jeanswear sourcing has been shifting from owned plants in western europe to lower cost owned production outside of western europe and contracted production in the middle east africa and asia 

to an increasing extent we are using independent contractors who own the raw materials and ship only finished readyforsale products to vf these contractors are engaged through vf sourcing hubs in hong kong and miami these hubs are responsible for product procurement product quality assurance and supplier management and handling functions in the eastern and western hemispheres respectively all products in the outdoor and sportswear coalitions as well as a growing portion of product requirements for our other coalitions are obtained through these sourcing hubs 

all contracted production must meet vf’s high quality standards further each of the over 1500 independent contractors that manufacture apparel products for vf must be precertified and sign a terms of engagement agreement prior to performance of any production on vf’s behalf these requirements provide strict standards covering hours of work age of workers health and safety conditions and conformity with local laws we also require our independent licensees and their contractors to comply with these standards we maintain an ongoing audit program to ensure compliance with these requirements by using dedicated internal and outsourced staff 

the current sourcing strategy for products sold in the united states allows us to balance our needs with a mix of vfowned and contracted production in the western hemisphere combined with contracted production primarily from asia owned production generally has a lower cost than contracted production overall product obtained from the western hemisphere has somewhat higher cost but gives us greater flexibility shorter lead times and lower inventory levels as compared with production obtained from the far east and other more distant resources this combination of vfowned and contracted production along with different geographic regions and cost structures provides a balanced approach to product sourcing 

vf did not experience difficulty in filling its raw material and contracting production needs during 2006 management does not anticipate difficulties in obtaining its raw materials and contracting production requirements during 2007 the loss of any one supplier or contractor would not have a significant adverse effect on our business 

imports and import restrictions 

vf is exposed to certain risks of doing business outside of the united states we import goods from vfowned manufacturing facilities in mexico and central america and from suppliers in those areas as well as suppliers in asia europe africa and the middle east these import transactions had been subject to the constraints imposed by bilateral agreements between the united states and a number of governments these agreements were negotiated either under the framework established by the world trade organization “wto” or other applicable statutes which imposed quotas that limited the amount of certain categories of merchandise from these countries that could be imported into the united states and the european union all restrictions under these agreements had ended as of december 31 2004 

pursuant to a 1995 agreement on textiles and clothing under the wto effective january 1 2005 the united states and other wto member countries were required with few exceptions to remove quotas on goods from wto member countries the complete removal of quotas may benefit vf as well as other apparel companies in the long run by allowing them to source products without quantitative limitation from any country the 

  only significant exceptions to the removal of quota that could affect vf are vietnam and china vietnam is a wto member as of january 11 2007 but with restraints on vietnam production that would allow the united states to impose antidumping duties in certain circumstances safeguard quotas pursuant to the terms of china’s accession agreement to the wto have been imposed against chinese exports and will last through 2008 these new restraints include products that vf imports and sells however we are well aware of developments with regards to safeguards and have made sourcing decisions accordingly any effect of the imposition of safeguards is not expected to be material to vf 

management continually monitors new developments and risks related to duties tariffs and quotas in response to the changing import environment resulting from the elimination of quotas management has chosen to continue its balanced approach to manufacturing and sourcing we limit vf’s sourcing exposure through among other measures i extensive geographic diversification with a mix of vfoperated and contracted production ii shifts of production among countries and contractors iii allocation of production to merchandise categories where the free flow of product is available and iv sourcing from countries with tariff preference and free trade agreements we will continue to manage our supply chain from a global perspective and adjust as needed to changes in the global production environment 

seasonality 

the apparel industry in the united states has four primary retail selling seasons — spring summer backtoschool and holiday while international markets typically have spring and fall selling seasons sales to retail customers generally precede the retail selling seasons although demand peaks have been reduced as more products are being sold to retailers on a replenishment basis 

overall with its diversified product offerings vf’s operating results are somewhat seasonal on a quarterly basis consolidated total revenues for 2006 ranged from a low of approximately 22 of full year revenues in the second quarter to a high of 29 in the third quarter this disparity results primarily from revenues of the outdoor coalition which are more seasonal in nature approximately 20 of outdoor coalition revenues occurred in the second quarter and 35 in the third quarter 

working capital requirements vary throughout the year working capital increases during the first half of the year as inventory builds to support peak shipping periods and accordingly decreases during the second half cash provided by operating activities is substantially higher in the second half of the year due to higher net income and reduced working capital requirements during that period 

advertising and customer support 

we support vf’s brands through extensive advertising and promotional programs we advertise on national and local radio and television and in consumer and trade publications and participate in cooperative advertising on a shared cost basis with major retailers in radio television and print media we sponsor various sporting music and other special events and sponsor a number of athletes and other personalities in addition we provide pointofsale fixtures and signage to our wholesale customers to enhance the presentation of our products at retail locations we spent 322 million advertising and promoting our products in 2006 an increase of 6 from the 2005 level 

we also participate in various retail customer incentive programs these incentive programs with retailers include discounts cooperative advertising funds and margin support funds we also offer sales incentive programs directly to consumers in the form of rebate and coupon offers these sales incentive offers with retailers and with consumers are recognized as sales discounts in arriving at reported net sales except that cooperative advertising reimbursements of documented and independently verified retailer costs are reported as advertising expense

internet web sites are maintained for most of our brands the web sites provide information about our products and in many cases direct consumers to our wholesale customers where they can purchase our products 

our jeanswear outdoor and sportswear coalitions employ a staff of instore marketing and merchandising coordinators located in major cities across the united states these individuals visit our customers’ retail locations to inform the customers’ sales force about our products and related promotions and to ensure that our products and those of our licensees are properly presented on the merchandise sales floor 

  other matters 

  competitive factors 

our business depends on our ability to stimulate consumer demand for vf’s brands and products vf is wellpositioned to compete in the apparel industry by developing consumerconnected and innovative products at competitive prices producing high quality merchandise providing high levels of service ensuring product availability to the retail sales floor and enhancing recognition of its brands we continually strive to improve on each of these areas many of vf’s brands have long histories and enjoy high recognition within their respective consumer segments 

  trademarks 

trademarks and trade names and their related logos designs and graphics have substantial value in the marketing of vf’s products we have registered these trademarks in the united states and with governmental agencies in other countries where our products are manufactured andor sold we vigorously monitor and protect these trademarks against infringement and dilution where legally feasible and appropriate in addition we grant licenses to other parties to manufacture and sell products using our trademarks in product categories and in geographic areas in which vf does not operate 

  customers 

vf products are primarily sold through our sales force and independent sales agents and distributors vf’s customers are specialty stores department stores national chains and mass merchants in the united states and in international markets primarily in europe sales to vf’s ten largest customers all of which are retailers based in the united states amounted to 30 of total revenues in 2006 31 in 2005 and 35 in 2004 these larger customers included in alphabetical order federated department stores inc kohl’s corporation jc penney company inc sears holding corporation target corporation and walmart stores inc sales to the five largest customers amounted to approximately 24 of total revenues in 2006 25 in 2005 and 28 in 2004 sales to vf’s largest customer walmart stores inc totaled 132 of total revenues in 2006 140 in 2005 and 135 in 2004 substantially all of which were in the jeanswear coalition 

  employees 

vf employed approximately 45500 men and women in its continuing operations at the end of 2006 of which 17300 were located in the united states excluded are approximately 8700 employees of the intimate apparel businesses accounted for as discontinued operations at the end of 2006 approximately 300 employees in the united states are covered by a collective bargaining agreement in international markets a significant percentage of employees are covered by tradesponsored or governmental bargaining arrangements employee relations are considered to be good 

  backlog 

the dollar amount of vf’s order backlog as of any date is not meaningful and may not be indicative of actual future shipments and accordingly is not material for an understanding of the business of vf taken as a whole

 item 1a risk factors 

the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating vf’s business and the forwardlooking statements contained in this form 10k any of the following risks could materially adversely affect vf’s business its operating results and its financial condition 

risks specific to vf corporation 

a substantial portion of vf’s revenues and gross profit is derived from a small number of large customers the loss of any of these customers could substantially reduce vf’s profits 

  a few of vf’s customers account for a significant portion of revenues sales to vf’s ten largest customers were 30 of total revenues in fiscal 2006 with walmart stores inc accounting for 132 of revenues sales are generally on a purchase order basis and we do not have longterm agreements with any of our customers a decision by any of vf’s major customers to decrease significantly the number of products purchased from vf could substantially reduce revenues and have a material adverse effect on vf’s financial condition and results of operations moreover the retail industry has experienced consolidation and other ownership changes such as the merger of federated department stores inc and the may department stores company in 2005 and the merger of sears roebuck and company and kmart holding corporation in 2005 in the future retailers may further consolidate undergo restructurings or reorganizations realign their affiliations or reposition their stores’ target market these developments could decrease the number of stores that carry vf’s products or increase the ownership concentration within the retail industry these changes could both impact vf’s opportunities in the market and increase vf’s reliance on a smaller number of large customers 

vf’s business could be adversely affected by financial instability experienced by its customers 

during the past several years various retailers have experienced significant financial difficulties which in some cases have resulted in bankruptcies liquidations and store closings vf sells a large portion of its products on open account to national and regional department midtier and mass market stores in the united states the financial difficulties of a customer could result in reduced business with that customer vf may also assume higher credit risk relating to receivables of a customer experiencing financial difficulty if these developments occur our inability to shift sales to other customers or to collect on vf’s trade accounts receivable from a major customer could substantially reduce vf’s income and have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations 

the apparel industry is highly competitive and vf’s success depends on its ability to respond to constantly changing fashion trends and consumer demand reduced sales or prices resulting from competition could have a material adverse effect on vf 

vf competes with numerous domestic and foreign brands and manufacturers of apparel in addition vf competes directly with the private label brands of its wholesale customers vf’s ability to compete within the apparel and footwear industries depends on its ability to 

 

we attempt to minimize risks associated with competition including risks related to changing style trends and product acceptance by studying consumer and retail sales trends the failure however to compete effectively or to keep pace with rapidly changing markets and trends could have a material adverse effect on vf’s business financial condition and results of operations in addition if we misjudge fashion trends and market conditions we could be faced with significant excess inventories for some products that we may have to sell at a loss or missed opportunities with other products that may result in lost sales 

vf’s profitability may decline as a result of increasing pressure on margins 

the apparel industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors including intense competition consolidation in the retail industry pressure from retailers to reduce the costs of products and changes in consumer demand these factors may cause us to reduce our sales prices to retailers and consumers which could cause vf’s gross margin to decline if we are unable to offset price reductions with comparable 

  reductions in its operating costs if vf’s sales prices decline and we fail to sufficiently reduce our product costs or operating expenses vf’s profitability will decline this could have a material adverse effect on vf’s results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

vf may not succeed in implementing its growth strategy 

one of our key strategic objectives is growth we seek to grow through both organic growth and acquisitions building new growing lifestyle brands expanding our share with winning customers stretching vf’s brands and customers to new geographies fueling the growth by leveraging our supply chain and information technology capabilities across vf expanding our directtoconsumer business and building new growth enablers by identifying and developing high potential employees we may not be able to grow our existing businesses or achieve planned cost savings from ongoing businesses we may have difficulty identifying acquisition targets and we may not be able to successfully integrate a newly acquired business or achieve any expected cost savings or synergies from such integration we may not be able to expand our market share with winning customers expand our brands geographically or achieve the expected results from our supply chain initiatives we may also have difficulty recruiting or developing qualified managers the failure to implement its growth strategies may have a material adverse effect on vf’s business 

if vf encounters problems with its distribution system vf’s ability to deliver its products to the market would be adversely affected 

vf relies on its distribution facilities to warehouse and using its own employees or in some cases independent contractors to ship product to its customers vf’s distribution system includes computercontrolled and automated equipment which means its operations are complicated and may be subject to a number of risks related to security or computer viruses the proper operation of software and hardware electronic or power interruptions or other system failures because substantially all of vf’s products are distributed from a relatively small number of locations vf’s operations could also be interrupted by earthquakes floods fires or other natural disasters near its distribution centers we maintain business interruption insurance but it may not adequately protect vf from the adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in vf’s distribution facilities such as the longterm loss of customers or an erosion of brand image in addition vf’s distribution capacity is dependent on the timely performance of services by third parties including the transportation of product to and from its distribution facilities if we encounter problems with our distribution system our ability to meet customer expectations manage inventory complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies could be materially adversely affected 

vf relies significantly on information technology any inadequacy interruption integration failure or security failure of that technology could harm vf’s ability to effectively operate its business 

our ability to effectively manage and operate our business depends significantly on its information technology systems the failure of these systems to operate effectively problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems difficulty in integrating new systems or systems of acquired businesses or a breach in security of these systems could adversely impact the operations of vf’s business it could also require significant expenditures to remediate any such failure problem or breach 

vf uses foreign suppliers and manufacturing facilities for a substantial portion of its finished products and raw materials which poses risks to vf’s business operations 

during fiscal 2006 in excess of 65 of vf’s products sold were produced by and purchased or procured from independent manufacturers primarily located in asia and more than 30 were produced by vfowned and operated manufacturing facilities primarily located in europe mexico and central america although no single supplier and no one country is critical to vf’s production needs any of the following could materially and adversely affect our ability to produce or deliver vf products and as a result have a material adverse effect on vf’s business financial condition and results of operations 

   

 

 

 

 

 

if vf’s suppliers fail to use acceptable ethical business practices vf’s business could suffer 

we require third party suppliers to operate in compliance with applicable laws rules and regulations regarding working conditions employment practices and environmental compliance additionally we require all suppliers making vfbranded apparel whether directly for vf or for its licensees to comply with vf’s terms of engagement and global compliance principles our staff and third parties retained for such purposes periodically visit and audit the operations of vf’s owned and operated facilities and of independent contractors manufacturing product for vf to determine compliance however we do not control independent manufacturers or their labor and other business practices if one of our independent contractors violates labor or other laws or implements labor or other business practices that are generally regarded as unethical in the united states the shipment of finished products to vf could be interrupted orders could be cancelled relationships could be terminated and vf’s reputation could be damaged any of these events could have a material adverse effect on vf’s revenues and consequently its results of operations 

vf’s results of operations could be materially harmed if vf is unable to accurately forecast demand for its products 

we often schedule internal production and place orders for products with independent manufacturers before our customers’ orders are firm therefore if we fail to accurately forecast customer demand we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of product to deliver to our customers factors that could affect our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory writedowns and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices which would have an adverse effect on vf’s results of operations and financial condition in addition if we underestimate demand for our products our manufacturing facilities or third party manufacturers may not be able to produce products to meet customer requirements and this could result in delays in the shipment of products and lost revenues as well as damage to vf’s reputation and customer relationships there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully manage inventory demand to meet future order and reorder requirements 

the loss of members of vf’s executive management and other key employees could have a material adverse effect on its business 

vf depends on the services and management experience of its executive officers who have substantial experience and expertise in vf’s business vf also depends on other key employees involved in the operation of its business competition for qualified personnel in the apparel industry is intense the unexpected loss of services of one or more of these individuals could materially adversely affect vf 

vf may be unable to protect its trademarks and other intellectual property rights 

vf’s trademarks and other intellectual property rights are important to its success and its competitive position vf is susceptible to others imitating its products and infringing its intellectual property rights with the shift in product mix to higher priced brands vf is more susceptible to infringement of its intellectual property rights some of vf’s brands such as the north face â  jansport â  nautica â  wrangler â and lee â brands enjoy significant worldwide consumer recognition and the generally higher pricing of such branded products creates additional risk of counterfeiting and infringement 

imitation or counterfeiting of vf’s products or infringement of its intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our brands or otherwise adversely affect vf revenues actions we have taken to establish and protect vf’s trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of its products by others or to prevent others from seeking to invalidate its trademarks or block sales of vf’s products as a violation of the trademarks and intellectual property rights of others 

the value of vf’s intellectual property could diminish if others assert rights in or ownership of trademarks and other intellectual property rights of vf or in trademarks that are similar to vf’s trademarks or trademarks that vf licenses andor markets we may be unable to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction in some cases there may be trademark owners who have prior rights to vf’s trademarks because the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states in other cases there may be holders who have prior rights to similar trademarks vf is from time to time involved in opposition and cancellation proceedings with respect to some items of its intellectual property 

vf obtains licensing royalties and relies on its licensees to maintain the value of its brands 

although only a relatively small portion of vf’s revenues 78 million or 13 was derived from licensing royalties in 2006 and although vf generally has significant control over its licensee’s products and advertising we rely on our licensees for among other things operational and financial controls over their businesses failure of our licensees to successfully market licensed products or our inability to replace existing licensees could adversely affect vf’s revenues both directly from reduced royalties received and indirectly from reduced sales of its other products risks are also associated with a licensee’s ability to 

 

 

 

   

 

 

in addition vf relies on its licensees to help preserve the value of its brands although we make every attempt to protect vf’s brands through among other things approval rights over design production processes and quality packaging merchandising distribution advertising and promotion of its products we cannot completely control the use by our licensees of licensed vf brands the misuse of a brand by a licensee could have a material adverse effect on that brand 

risks applicable to the apparel industry 

vf’s revenues and profits depend on the level of consumer spending for apparel which is sensitive to general economic conditions and other factors affecting consumer confidence 

the apparel industry has historically been subject to substantial cyclical variations and is particularly affected by adverse trends in the general economy the success of vf’s operations depends on consumer spending consumer spending is influenced by a number of factors including actual and perceived economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as unemployment and wages business conditions interest rates energy prices availability of credit and tax rates in the international national regional and local markets where vf’s products are sold any significant deterioration in general economic conditions recession or increases in interest rates could reduce the level of consumer spending and inhibit consumers’ use of credit a significant decline in the securities markets could materially affect consumer confidence the financial condition of vf’s customers and vf’s operating costs through higher contributions to its pension plan in addition natural disasters war terrorist activity or the threat of war or terrorist activity could adversely affect consumer spending and thereby have a material adverse effect on vf’s financial condition and results of operations 

fluctuations in the price availability and quality of raw materials could increase costs and cause delay 

fluctuations in the price availability and quality of the fabrics or other raw materials used by vf in its manufactured apparel could have a material adverse effect on vf’s cost of sales or its ability to meet its customers’ demands the prices for such fabrics depend on demand and market prices for the raw materials used to produce them particularly cotton the price and availability of such raw materials may fluctuate significantly depending on many factors including crop yields and weather patterns in the future vf may not be able to pass all or a portion of such higher raw materials prices on to its customers 

vf’s business is exposed to foreign currency fluctuations 

approximately 26 of vf’s total revenues is derived from international markets vf’s foreign businesses operate in functional currencies other than the united states dollar assets liabilities revenues and expenses in these foreign businesses are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in addition vf sources and manufactures most of its products overseas as a result the cost of these products may be affected by changes in the value of the relevant currencies changes in currency exchange rates may also affect the us dollar value of the foreign currency denominated amounts at which vf’s international businesses purchase products incur costs or sell products furthermore vf’s international sales and licensing revenue are derived from sales in foreign currencies although we hedge some exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange rates arising in the ordinary course of business foreign currency fluctuations could have a material adverse impact on vf’s financial condition and results of operations 

vf’s ability to sell products in international markets may be affected by legal regulatory political and economic risks 

  our ability to maintain the current level of operations in our existing international markets and to capitalize on growth in new international markets is subject to risks associated with international operations these include the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws and regulations unexpected changes in regulatory requirements new tariffs or other barriers to some international markets 

we cannot predict whether quotas duties taxes or other similar restrictions will be imposed by the united states the european union japan or other countries upon the import or export of its products in the future or what effect any of these actions would have on vf’s business financial condition or results of operations changes in regulatory geopolitical policies and other factors may adversely affect vf’s business or may require us to modify our current business practices

overview 

vf corporation is a leading marketer of branded lifestyle apparel and related products in the united states and in many international markets unless the context indicates otherwise the terms “vf” “we” “us” and “our” used herein refer to vf corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries management’s vision is to grow vf by building leading lifestyle brands that excite consumers around the world lifestyle brands representative of the activities that consumers aspire to will generally extend across multiple product categories and therefore have greater opportunities for growth vf owns a diverse portfolio of brands with strong market positions in several consumer product categories in addition we market occupational apparel to distributors and major employers vf has a broad customer base with products distributed through leading specialty stores department stores national chains and mass merchants plus vfoperated retail stores 

we are organized around our principal product categories and major brands within those categories these groupings of businesses referred to as “coalitions” are summarized as follows 

  

 

  discontinued operations 

as part of our strategic plan to shift vf’s portfolio mix to higher growth higher margin lifestyle brands management and the board of directors decided in late 2006 to dispose of the women’s intimate apparel business vf’s intimate apparel business includes such leading brands as vanity fair â  lily of france â  vassarette â  bestform â and curvation â in the us and lou â  gemma â and belcor â in europe on january 22 2007 we entered into a definitive agreement to sell the business for 350 million in cash the agreement is subject to government approvals and customary closing conditions and is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2007 

because vf has decided to exit this business the operating results assets liabilities and cash flows of the global intimate apparel business were separately presented in 2006 as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements and amounts for prior periods were similarly reclassified

during 2006 2005 and 2004 the operations of the global intimate apparel business contributed 353 million 359 million and 758 million to net income respectively a primary factor in the strong performance in 2004 was a new program with a major private label customer this private label program declined significantly in 2005 the decline in profits in 2006 and 2005 was driven by lower sales levels and the resulting impact from unused manufacturing capacity and lower overhead cost absorption in addition to the 353 million income from operations in 2006 we recorded a charge of 368 million net of an income tax benefit of 109 million for the estimated loss on disposal of the intimate apparel business the financial impact of the global intimate apparel business on vf will not be significant in 2007 

see note c to the consolidated financial statements for further details about the discontinued operations unless otherwise stated the remaining sections of this discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition relate only to continuing operations 

longterm financial targets 

we have established several longterm financial targets that guide us in our strategic decisions we expect attainment of these targets to drive increases in total shareholder return these targets are summarized below 

 

   

 

many of our businesses currently exceed the 14 benchmark and all of our coalitions report double digit margins we constantly pursue cost reduction opportunities in product distribution and administrative areas we will continue to evaluate our existing businesses to ensure that they meet our strategic and financial objectives as demonstrated by our decision to exit the global intimate apparel business in 2006 

 

 

average common stockholders’ equity plus average short and longterm debt 

vf earned a 147 return on invested capital in 2006 and a 142 return in 2005 our return in recent years has been impacted by acquisition activity during those periods as it often takes a period of years to achieve the targeted 17 rate of return for acquired businesses nevertheless we will continue to pursue this ambitious target 

 

   

 

strategic objectives 

we have developed a growth plan that we believe will enable vf to achieve its longterm revenue and earnings targets our growth strategy consists of six drivers 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

highlights of 2006 

there were several notable actions and achievements in 2006 

 

analysis of results of continuing operations 

acquisitions 

vf acquired a 60 interest in a newly formed joint venture to design market and distribute vfbranded products in india for a total cost of approximately 33 million this acquisition added 13 million to revenues and was neutral to earnings per share in 2006 this business is expected to contribute at least 30 million in incremental revenues in 2007 

subsequent to the end of 2006 we announced the acquisition of eagle creek inc seller of eagle creek â brand packs luggage accessories and adventure travel gear which is expected to add approximately 30 million to revenues in 2007 

see note b to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our acquisitions over the last three years 

stockbased compensation 

as discussed in note a to the consolidated financial statements we adopted financial accounting standards board “fasb” statement no 123revised sharebased payment 

  “statement 123r” effective as of the beginning of 2005 this statement requires the recognition of compensation cost for grants of stock options and also modifies the accounting of other forms of stockbased compensation vf recorded in the 2005 consolidated statement of income a noncash charge of 118 million net of income taxes of 79 million as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting policy for periods prior to january 2005 financial statements for 2004 were not restated as a result of adopting this statement stockbased compensation increased from 100 million in 2004 to 400 million in 2005 and 460 million in 2006 

consolidated statements of income 

the following table presents a summary of the changes in our total revenues in the last two years 

 

total revenues consist of net sales of products and royalty income from licensees revenues in all of our ongoing businesses increased in 2006 due primarily to unit volume increases with the largest growth in our outdoor and jeanswear businesses revenues also increased in 2005 over 2004 due to growth in the outdoor businesses royalty income increased significantly in 2006 and 2005 from 2004 due to higher levels of licensing activity related to the nautica â brand additional details on revenues are provided in the section titled “information by business segment” 

the reef acquisition in 2005 added 47 million to revenues in 2006 prior to the 2006 anniversary date of its acquisition and 60 million to revenues in 2005 in january 2005 we acquired holoubek a business having rights to manufacture and market tshirts and fleece under the licensed harleydavidson â brand which added 40 million to 2005 sales the reef and holoubek acquisitions are collectively referred to as the “2005 acquisitions” 

  in translating foreign currencies into the us dollar the weaker us dollar in relation to the functional currencies where vf conducts the majority of its business primarily the european euro countries improved revenue comparisons by 11 million in 2006 relative to 2005 for 2005 revenue comparisons benefited by 32 million relative to 2004 the weighted average translation rate for the euro was 125 per euro during 2006 compared with 125 during 2005 and 123 during 2004 if the weakening of the us dollar that has occurred in recent months continues throughout 2007 reported revenues in 2007 will be positively impacted compared with 2006 

the following table presents the percentage relationship to total revenues for components of our consolidated statements of income 

 

gross margins increased to 434 of revenues in 2006 compared with 432 in 2005 and 412 in 2004 the increases in 2006 and 2005 primarily result from the revenue growth in our higher margin businesses this change in the mix of our business accounted for an increase in gross margin of 04 in 2006 over 2005 offset by the net impact of special items recorded in both 2006 and 2005 discussed in the longterm financial targets section above gross margins as a percent of total revenues increased 20 in 2005 over 2004 driven primarily by margin improvement in our outdoor and sportswear businesses resulting from lower sourced product costs 

today of net sales to customers in the united states 32 relates to products manufactured in vfowned facilities in mexico and central america and 67 relates to products obtained from contractors primarily in asia where we manufacture it is management’s belief that our product costs are generally lower in vfowned facilities than any available on a global basis for like products we believe a combination of vfowned and contracted production from different geographic regions provides flexibility and a competitive advantage in our product sourcing 

marketing administrative and general expenses increased as a percent of revenues to 301 in 2006 compared with 297 in 2005 and 285 in 2004 the 2006 increase in percent of 

  revenues resulted from additional spending on advertising in our jeanswear coalition and a shift in the mix of our businesses toward those with higher expense percentages specifically toward our growing lifestyle branded businesses our outdoor businesses including the more recently acquired brands such as reef vans kipling and napapijri have higher expense percentages than other vf businesses approximately 05 of the increase in 2005 over 2004 was due to stock option expense recognized under the new accounting policy adopted in 2005 with the remainder of the increase primarily related to changes in the mix of our businesses similar to those discussed above 

we include costs of cooperative advertising licensing retail stores and shipping and handling in marketing administrative and general expenses as stated in our significant accounting policies in note a to the consolidated financial statements some other companies classify cooperative advertising costs or licensing costs as a reduction of net sales or royalty income respectively while some classify retail store and shipping and handling costs in cost of goods sold accordingly our gross margins and operating expenses may not be directly comparable with other companies 

interest expense including amortization of debt discount debt issuance costs and the gain on an interest rate hedging contract decreased by 133 million in 2006 and 54 million in 2005 the decreases in both 2006 and 2005 were due to lower average interest rates and lower average debt outstanding average interestbearing debt outstanding totaled approximately 900 million for 2006 1030 million for 2005 and 1050 million for 2004 the weighted average interest rate was 61 for 2006 67 for 2005 and 70 for 2004 

the effective income tax rate was 312 in 2006 compared with 322 in 2005 and 330 in 2004 during 2006 we recorded a 169 million tax benefit 22 tax rate benefit from the favorable audit outcome on certain tax matters outside of the united states the effective income tax rate declined in 2005 relative to 2004 due to increased income in international jurisdictions that was taxed at lower rates and favorable settlements of prior years’ foreign and state income tax returns partially offset by additional taxes resulting from the repatriation of earnings from foreign subsidiaries under the american jobs creation act of 2004 

income from continuing operations increased 11 to 5351 million in 2006 and by 21 to 4826 million in 2005 from 3989 million in 2004 after considering the operating results of our discontinued global intimate apparel business and the expected loss on the sale of this business of 368 million vf reported net income of 5335 million 472 per share in 2006 32 

  

this represented an increase of 5 over reported net income of 5067 million 444 per share in 2005 which included an 118 million cumulative effect charge 010 per share for the change in accounting policy for stockbased compensation net income in 2004 was 4747 million 421 per share in translating foreign currencies into the us dollar the weaker us dollar had a 002 favorable impact on earnings per share in 2006 compared with 2005 and a 004 favorable impact in 2005 compared with 2004 in comparing 2006 to 2005 the reef acquisition had a 003 favorable impact to earnings per share 

information by business segment 

vf’s businesses are grouped into four product categories and by brands within those product categories for management and internal financial reporting purposes these groupings of businesses are referred to as “coalitions” both management and vf’s board of directors evaluate operating performance at the coalition level these coalitions represent vf’s reportable segments 

for business segment reporting purposes coalition revenues and coalition profit represent net sales royalty income and operating expenses under the direct control of an individual coalition along with amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets and its share of centralized corporate expenses directly related to the coalition corporate expenses not apportioned to the coalitions and net interest expense are excluded from coalition profit importantly this basis of performance evaluation is consistent with that used for management incentive compensation 

see note r to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of our results of operations and other information by coalition along with a reconciliation of coalition profit to income from continuing operations before income taxes coalition results are not necessarily indicative of operating results that would have been reported had each business coalition been an independent standalone entity during the periods presented further vf’s presentation of coalition profit may not be comparable with similar measures used by other companies 

the following table presents a summary of the changes in our total revenues by coalition during the last two years 

   

  jeanswear 

the jeanswear coalition consists of our global jeanswear businesses led by the wrangler â and lee â brands overall jeanswear revenues were up 3 in 2006 over 2005 revenues for 2005 versus 2004 were flat a 3 increase in domestic jeanswear revenues was led by the turnaround of the lee â brand which posted a 6 increase over 2005 this improvement resulted from more effective increased marketing investments as well as new products targeted at our core consumer our domestic mass market revenues increased by 4 in 2006 these increases were partially offset by the exit of the earl jean business in early 2006 in 2005 domestic jeanswear revenues declined 2 with gains in mass market and western specialty products more than offset by a decline in the lee â brand business approximately onehalf of the sales decrease at lee was due to the significant consolidation taking place in the midtier channel of distribution in the us the remainder of the decline was largely due to lack of performance of new products at retail particularly in the lee â brand’s traditionally strong women’s business 

jeanswear revenues in international markets — europe canada mexico latin america and asia — also increased 3 in 2006 over 2005 approximately 2 of the increase resulted from our newly established joint venture in india revenues increased in all foreign jurisdictions other than canada which was flat jeanswear revenues in international markets increased by 5 in 2005 with twothirds of the increase due to a 25 million benefit from favorable foreign currency translation 

  jeanswear coalition operating margins were 168 in 2005 and 155 in 2006 the reduction in margin percentage in 2006 primarily resulted from special items included in both the 2006 and 2005 periods during 2006 actions were taken within our jeanswear business to reduce product costs and improve product development processes that cost jeanswear 145 million and negatively impacted 2006 operating margins by 05 during 2005 profits benefited from a 147 million reduction in mexican postemployment benefit accruals which management had determined were greater than required under local laws this item positively impacted 2005 operating margins by 06 the remaining decline in operating margins in 2006 resulted from increased domestic spending on advertising and investments in retail stores overseas jeanswear coalition profit increased 2 in 2005 over 2004 with comparable increases in both domestic and international businesses in the united states profits increased in our mass market business which more than offset declines in our lee â brand and our earl jean â business which was sold in early 2006 in addition profits in 2005 benefited from the 147 million reduction in mexican postemployment benefit accruals mentioned above 

  outdoor 

the outdoor coalition consists of vf’s outdoorrelated businesses including the north face â brand apparel footwear and equipment jansport â and eastpak â daypacks and apparel vans â performance and casual footwear and apparel kipling â bags and accessories napapijri â outdoorbased sportswear and reef â beachinspired footwear and apparel revenues increased 28 in 2006 primarily through organic growth led by unit volume increases from strong consumer demand for the north face â and vans â products in the united states and internationally the acquisition of reef also added 47 million to 2006 revenues for the period prior to its acquisition anniversary date revenues increased 44 in 2005 with the reef acquisition adding 60 million and the 2004 outdoor coalition acquisitions adding 264 million for the period prior to their respective acquisition anniversary dates revenues in both years benefited from the favorable effects of foreign currency translation — 8 million in 2006 and 6 million in 2005 relative to the respective prior years 

coalition profit increased 28 in 2006 consistent with the revenue increase above the operating margin in both 2006 and 2005 for the outdoor coalition was 160 the 2005 acquisition of reef added approximately 5 million or 2 to coalition profit in 2006 coalition profit increased 49 in 2005 over 2004 over onehalf of the increase in 2005 was due to higher profits resulting from a full year of operations in the vans napapijri and kipling businesses acquired during 2004 because reef was acquired in april 2005 late in its seasonally strong sales season its contribution to coalition profit was minimal in 2005 the remainder of the 2005 increase was due primarily to unit volume increases at the north face 

    imagewear 

the imagewear coalition includes vf’s occupational industrial career and safety apparel business as well as our licensed apparel business coalition revenues increased 3 in 2006 occupational apparel revenues were up 2 led by growth in the public services and governmental sector offset by the exit of our underperforming commodity fleece and tshirt business licensed apparel revenues increased 4 in 2006 led by growth in the licensed national football league business coalition revenues increased 5 in 2005 primarily from the acquisition of holoubek in early 2005 occupational apparel revenues increased 3 in 2005 primarily in industrial workwear sales of industrial workwear were up in 2005 with increased industrial employment in the us revenues of the licensed business increased in 2005 with the acquisition of holoubek and increases in sales of products under license from the national football league and major league baseball 

coalition profit increased 6 in 2006 with substantially all of the growth in licensed sports apparel profits in the uniformoccupational apparel business were flat in 2006 compared with 2005 operating margin for the imagewear coalition increased from 157 in 2005 to a record 162 in 2006 resulting from lower advertising costs and lower increases in administrative and other fixed costs in relation to revenue growth coalition profit increased 8 in 2005 due to lower product costs improved operating efficiencies and the impact of the holoubek acquisition 

  sportswear 

the sportswear coalition consists of our nautica â lifestyle brand and the john varvatos â luxury collection for men the coalition also includes the kipling â brand business in north america whereas the kipling ® brand is managed as part of the outdoor coalition in europe coalition revenues increased 5 in 2006 including a 4 increase in our nautica â brand revenues and strong growth in our john varvatos and kipling businesses coalition revenues increased 5 during 2005 including a 3 increase in our nautica â brand revenues and the benefit of a full year of kipling â brand revenues 

sportswear coalition operating margins were 133 in 2006 and 154 in 2005 coalition profit declined in 2006 from 2005 primarily due to the investments behind the fall 2006 introduction of a nautica â brand women’s sportswear collection coalition profit for the nautica â brand increased significantly in 2005 over 2004 due to i improved product performance at our wholesale customers resulting in fewer markdowns and returns ii cost reductions and iii other operating efficiencies the kipling business has been profitable in 

  each of the last three years while the john varvatos business incurred losses as planned in each year 

  other 

the other business segment includes the vf outlet business unit of companyoperated retail outlet stores in the united states that primarily sell excess quantities of first quality vf apparel products revenues and profits of vf products are reported as part of the operating results of the respective coalitions while revenues and profits of nonvf products primarily childrenswear hosiery underwear and accessories which provide a broader selection of merchandise to attract consumer traffic are reported in this business segment 

the other business segment also includes the results of vf playwear for 2005 and 2004 trademarks and certain operating assets of this business were sold in may 2004 with inventories and other assets liquidated over the remainder of 2004 and in 2005 the segment loss in 2004 included net charges of 95 million related to the disposal of this business see note c to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of vf playwear’s revenues and losses for 2005 and 2004

  reconciliation of coalition profit to consolidated income before income taxes 

there are two types of costs necessary to reconcile total coalition profit as discussed in the preceding paragraphs to income before income taxes these costs discussed below are interest and corporate and other expenses see also note r to the consolidated financial statements 

interest expense net was discussed in the previous “consolidated statements of income” section interest is excluded from coalition profit because substantially all of our financing costs are managed at the corporate office and are not under the control of coalition management 

corporate and other expenses consists of corporate headquarters’ and similar costs that are not apportioned to the operating coalitions these expenses are summarized as follows  

   

information systems and shared services  included are costs of our management information systems and of our centralized shared services center which includes common financial supply chain human resources and customer management services that support our worldwide operations operating costs of information systems and shared services are charged to the coalitions based on utilization of those services such as minutes of computer processing time number of transactions or number of users costs to develop new computer applications that will be used across vf are not allocated to the coalitions approximately onehalf of the increase in gross information systems and shared services costs in 2006 related to information systems development and information technology infrastructure costs the remainder of the increase resulted from increased spending in our supply chain and customer management groups a greater proportion of management information systems and other costs was allocated to the coalitions in 2006 primarily related to information systems activations across vf 

about twothirds of the increase in 2005 net of amounts apportioned to the coalitions related to additional information systems costs for common systems implementation and additional consulting costs with the balance related to startup costs for centralization of sourcing distribution and other efforts to improve efficiency and drive cost reduction 

corporate headquarters’ costs  headquarters’ costs include compensation and benefits of corporate management and staff certain legal and professional fees and administrative and general expenses which are not apportioned to the coalitions the decrease in these costs from 2005 to 2006 resulted primarily from a reduction in severance costs from 2005 approximately 88 million of the increase from 2004 to 2005 was driven by the initial recognition of stock option expense for corporate management upon adoption of a new accounting standard in 

  addition costs increased in 2005 over 2004 due to recruiting relocation and compensation of additional corporate staff positions to drive growth for vf and due to severancerelated costs 

trademark maintenance and enforcement  legal and other costs of registering maintaining and enforcing the majority of vf’s trademarks plus related costs of licensing administration are controlled by a centralized trademark and licensing staff and are not allocated to the coalitions the increase in these costs in 2006 is consistent with the growth in our business and expansion of our brand portfolio costs were higher in 2004 due to foreign currency hedging losses incurred on licensing transactions 

other  this category includes i adjustments to convert the earnings of certain business units using the fifo inventory valuation method for internal reporting to the lifo method for consolidated financial reporting ii miscellaneous costs that result from corporate programs or corporatemanaged decisions that are not allocated to the business units for internal management reporting and iii other consolidating adjustments 

analysis of financial condition 

balance sheets 

accounts receivable increased in 2006 due to a 9 increase in fourth quarter revenues over 2005 and an 8 increase in the number of days’ sales outstanding there was 20 sales growth during the fourth quarter in our europe and asia businesses where payment terms are substantially longer than those of the us businesses this accounted for nearly all of the increase in the number of days’ sales outstanding finally a weaker us dollar accounted for 3 of the increase in the 2006 accounts receivable balance over 2005 

inventories increased by 6 in 2006 which was lower than the percentage increase of sales in the fourth quarter of 2006 and the anticipated increase in the first quarter of 2007 resulting in a decline in days’ sales in inventory in addition the increase in 2006 included a 2 impact from translating foreign inventories into us dollars considering the weaker dollar used in translation at the end of 2006 and a 1 impact from the inclusion of the acquired inventory in the joint venture in india 

other current assets included an increase in valueadded taxes arising in slower paying jurisdictions the additional amounts will be recoverable over the next year 

  property plant and equipment increased in 2006 capital spending in 2006 exceeded depreciation expense in addition the 2006 balance increased due to the inclusion of a 43 million leased facility for a new outdoor coalition distribution center recorded as a capital lease the increase in property plant and equipment spending was due to expenditures to support the growth of our businesses including a heavier spend to support new retail store rollouts intangible assets and goodwill each increased in 2006 due to the impact of foreign currency translation weaker us dollar and the acquisition in india in 2006 other assets decreased in 2006 due to the elimination of a 42 million intangible asset recognized under previous pension accounting rules this decrease was offset in part by additional assets held under deferred compensation plans see notes b f g h and i to the consolidated financial statements 

accounts payable was relatively flat in 2006 compared with 2005 despite higher overall inventory levels accrued liabilities declined in 2006 due to the 2005 balance including a 750 million minimum pension liability accrued under prior accounting standards for defined benefit pension plans 

during 2005 we entered into a new international bank credit agreement consisting of i a eurodenominated five year revolving credit agreement for a us dollar equivalent amount of 2300 million ii a eurodenominated two year term loan for a us dollar equivalent of 526 million and iii a us dollardenominated two year term loan for 400 million at the end of 2005 there was 2202 million outstanding under the agreement of which 1001 million was classified as shortterm borrowings because of our intent to repay that amount during 2006 and 1201 million was classified as longterm debt under the revolving credit agreement because of our intent to continue that amount outstanding through 2006 during 2006 we repaid the us dollardenominated term loan of 400 million and 218 million of the eurodenominated term loan as of the end of 2006 there was 1708 million outstanding under the international bank credit agreement of which 394 million was classified as shortterm borrowings and 328 million as current portion of longterm debt because of our intent to repay those amounts during 2007 we have no intention of paying down the remaining 986 million outstanding under the revolving credit agreement in 2007 and accordingly that amount is classified as longterm debt 

the current portion of longterm debt is 689 million at the end of 2006 including the 328 million borrowing under the international credit facility discussed above and the discounted amount of a 330 million principal installment due in connection with the 2003 nautica 

  acquisition the longterm debt balance declined from 2005 to 2006 as a result of reclassifying 328 million of the revolving credit borrowings under the international facility and the remaining installment under the nautica acquisition to current these declines were offset by a capital lease obligation for an outdoor coalition distribution center 

in september 2006 the fasb issued fasb statement no 158 employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans “statement 158” statement 158 effective for december 2006 requires that the funded status of a defined benefit plan measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and projected benefit obligations be recorded in the balance sheet statement 158 also requires that gains and losses for differences between actuarial assumptions and actual results and that unrecognized prior service costs be recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 

statement 158 results in changes in the balance sheet recognition of defined benefit plans but does not change the measurement of plan assets and obligations or the measurement of benefit expense in the statement of income in accordance with statement 158 prior period financial statements were not restated see note n for a discussion of assets and liabilities related to defined benefit plans in vf’s 2006 consolidated balance sheet compared with their recognition in the 2005 consolidated balance sheet under the prior rules 

under the newly adopted statement 158 at the end of 2006 1438 million of the total 1468 million unfunded pension liability based on projected benefit obligations was recorded in other liabilities with the balance classified in current liabilities also in accordance with statement 158 we recorded a pretax charge of 2154 million in accumulated other comprehensive income loss at the end of 2006 this represented the sum of deferred actuarial losses and deferred prior service costs at that date at the end of 2005 under the prior accounting rules the excess of accumulated benefit obligations over the sum of the fair value of plan assets and previously accrued pension liabilities termed the “minimum pension liability” was 1719 million this minimum pension liability resulted in a charge to accumulated other comprehensive income loss in 2005 in addition 750 million of the minimum pension liability was classified as a current liability because vf contributed that amount to the pension plan in early 2006 

  liquidity and cash flows 

the financial condition of vf is reflected in the following 

 

for the ratio of debt to total capital debt is defined as shortterm and longterm borrowings and total capital is defined as debt plus common stockholders’ equity our ratio of net debt to total capital with net debt defined as debt less cash and equivalents was 121 at the end of 2006 

vf’s primary source of liquidity is its strong cash flow provided by operating activities cash flow from operating activities of continuing operations which was 4541 million in 2006 5337 million in 2005 and 6464 million in 2004 is primarily dependent on the level of income from continuing operations and changes in investments in inventories and other working capital components income from continuing operations was 5351 million 4826 million and 3989 million in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively income from continuing operations in each year included noncash stockbased compensation expense of 460 million 400 million and 100 million in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively the significant increase in 2005 was due to the adoption of statement 123r requiring recognition of stock option expense on a fair value basis in the financial statements the net change in working capital components during 2006 was a cash usage of 2092 million compared with cash usage of 946 million in 2005 and cash provided of 560 million in 2004 major reasons for changes in the yeartoyear cash impact from working capital over this three year period related to i an increase in accounts receivable at the end of 2006 as discussed in the “balance sheets” section above ii increases in inventory in 2005 and 2006 due to the growth in our businesses that are not offset by related changes in accounts payable iii increases in accrued incentive compensation as amounts earned in a year are paid early in the following year iv increases in accrued income taxes due to higher net income and v in 2004 approximately 40 million of cash provided by the liquidation of vf playwear’s working capital note c to the consolidated financial statements 

to finance its ongoing operations and most unusual circumstances that may arise vf anticipates continued future strong cash generation in addition vf has significant existing liquidity from its available cash balance and debt capacity supported by its strong credit rating vf has a 42 

  

7500 million unsecured committed bank facility that expires in september 2008 this bank facility supports a 7500 million commercial paper program any issuance of commercial paper would reduce the amount available under the bank facility at the end of 2006 7405 million was available for borrowing under this credit agreement with 95 million of standby letters of credit issued under the agreement vf also has a 2300 million us dollar equivalent unsecured committed revolving facility under an international bank credit agreement at the end of 2006 854 million was available for borrowing under this credit agreement further under a registration statement filed in 1994 with the securities and exchange commission vf has the ability to offer on a delayed or continuous basis up to 3000 million of additional debt equity or other securities 

the principal investing activity over the last three years related to business acquisitions we paid cash of 698 million 2118 million and 6491 million for acquisitions in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively net of cash balances in the acquired companies cash paid in 2006 included the discounted amount of a 330 million installment note payment related to the nautica acquisition in 2003 the acquisitions were funded with existing vf cash balances and shortterm commercial paper borrowings all commercial paper borrowings plus debt of the acquired companies of 288 million in 2004 were repaid in the year of acquisition 

capital expenditures were 1272 million in 2006 compared with 1030 million and 741 million in 2005 and 2004 respectively capital expenditures in each of these years generally related to retail and distribution as well as maintenance spending in our worldwide manufacturing facilities we expect that capital spending could reach 145 million in 2007 with the increase related to distribution projects and to higher retail store investments capital spending will be funded by cash flow from operations in addition during 2006 vf entered into a capital lease of a distribution center with the present value of lease payments totaling approximately 43 million 

during 2005 vf repaid 4013 million of longterm debt at scheduled maturity dates also during 2005 vf borrowed a total of 2202 million under a new international bank credit agreement during 2006 vf repaid 618 million of our borrowings under the international bank credit agreement see notes j and l to the consolidated financial statements 

in addition statement 123r requires that income tax benefits related to stock option exercises be reported in the financing activities section of the statements of cash flows accordingly 241 million and 177 million of such tax benefits for 2006 and 2005 respectively 

  were classified in the financing activities section compared with 131 million classified in the operating activities section under the prior rules in 2004 

in january 2007 standard  poor’s ratings services affirmed its ‘a minus’ longterm corporate credit and senior unsecured debt rating ‘a2’ commercial paper rating and ‘stable’ outlook for vf standard  poor’s also stated that the ratings and outlook would not be affected by the decision to sell the global intimate apparel business in june 2006 moody’s investors service affirmed vf’s longterm debt rating of ‘a3’ and commercial paper rating of ‘prime2’ and amended the ratings outlook to ‘stable’ from ‘negative’ in january 2007 moody’s investors service affirmed its longterm debt rating of ‘a3’ and ratings outlook of ‘stable’ and stated that the ratings and outlook would not be affected by the decision to sell the global intimate apparel business existing debt agreements do not contain acceleration of maturity clauses based on changes in credit ratings 

during 2006 vf purchased 20 million shares of its common stock in open market transactions at a cost of 1186 million average price of 5929 per share in addition vf purchased 40 million shares of its common stock in 2005 at a cost of 2290 million average price of 5725 per share the primary objective of our share repurchase program is to reduce the impact of dilution caused by exercises of stock options under its current authorization from the board of directors vf may purchase an additional 93 million shares we currently plan to use the 350 million estimated proceeds from the sale of our intimate apparel business to repurchase shares during 2007 however the actual number purchased during 2007 may vary from current expectations depending on funding required to support business acquisitions and other opportunities 

cash dividends totaled 194 per common share in 2006 compared with 110 in 2005 and 105 in 2004 prior to 2006 our target was to pay dividends representing 30 of our diluted earnings per share on a longterm basis in may 2006 we increased our quarterly dividend by 90 from 029 to 055 per share with the first payment under the new rate beginning with the june 2006 payment date this resulted in a dividend payout rate of 411 in 2006 compared with payout rates of 242 in 2005 and 249 in 2004 we now expect to pay dividends of at least 40 of our diluted earnings per share on a longterm basis the current indicated annual dividend rate for 2007 is 220 per share 

following is a summary of vf’s contractual obligations and commercial commitments at the end of 2006 that will require the use of funds 

   

 

 we have other financial commitments at the end of 2006 that are not included in the above table but may require the use of funds under certain circumstances 

 

   

 

 

management believes that vf’s cash balances and funds provided by operating activities as well as unused committed bank credit lines additional borrowing capacity and access to equity markets taken as a whole provide i adequate liquidity to meet all of its current and longterm obligations when due ii adequate liquidity to fund capital expenditures and to maintain our dividend payout policy and iii flexibility to meet investment opportunities that may arise 

we do not participate in transactions with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships established to facilitate offbalance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes 

risk management 

vf is exposed to a variety of market risks in the ordinary course of business we regularly assess these potential risks and manage our exposures to these risks through our operating and financing activities and when appropriate by utilizing natural hedges or by creating offsetting positions through the use of derivative financial instruments derivative financial instruments are contracts in which the value is linked to changes in currency exchange rates interest rates or other financial measures we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

we limit the risk of interest rate fluctuations on net income and cash flows by managing our mix of fixed and variable interest rate debt in addition we may also use derivative financial instruments to minimize our interest rate risk since 81 of our total longterm debt has fixed interest rates our primary interest rate exposure relates to changes in interest rates on shortterm borrowings including shortterm notes classified as longterm under the international revolving credit agreement which averaged approximately 329 million during 2006 however any change in interest rates would also affect interest income earned on vf’s cash equivalents on deposit based on average amounts of borrowings having variable interest rates and of cash on deposit during 2006 the effect of a hypothetical 10 change in interest rates on reported net income would not be material 

approximately 26 of our business in 2006 was conducted in international markets 

  substantially all of our foreign businesses operate in functional currencies other than the united states dollar assets and liabilities in these foreign businesses are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates during 2005 we entered into an international bank credit agreement that provides for eurodenominated borrowings at the end of 2006 euro borrowings under this agreement totaled € 130 million approximately 1708 million which reduces exposure to currency rate changes for our net eurodenominated assets net investments in our primarily european and latin american international businesses are considered to be longterm investments and accordingly foreign currency translation effects on those net assets are included in a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in common stockholders’ equity we do not hedge these net investments and do not hedge the translation of foreign currency operating results into the united states dollar 

a majority of our total product needs to support our businesses are manufactured in our plants in foreign countries or by independent foreign contractors we monitor net foreign currency market exposures and may in the ordinary course of business enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge specific foreign currency transactions or anticipated cash flows use of these financial instruments allows us to reduce vf’s overall exposure to exchange rate movements since gains and losses on these contracts will offset losses and gains on the transactions being hedged our practice is to hedge a portion of our net foreign currency cash flows relating to crossborder inventory purchases and production costs product sales and intercompany royalty payments anticipated during the following 12 months by buying or selling united states dollar contracts against various currencies 

we monitor vf’s foreign currency exposures and may enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge against the effects of exchange rate fluctuations for a portion of our anticipated foreign currency cash flows if there were a hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates of 10 compared with the end of 2006 the expected effect on the change in fair value of the hedging contracts outstanding would result in an unrealized loss of approximately 29 million based on changes in the timing and amount of foreign currency exchange rate movements the actual unrealized loss could differ however any such change in the fair value of the hedging contracts would also result in an offsetting change in the value of the transactions or anticipated cash flows being hedged 

vf is exposed to market risks for the pricing of cotton and other fibers which indirectly affects fabric prices we manage our fabric prices by ordering denim and other fabrics several months in advance but we have not historically managed commodity price exposures by using derivative instruments 

  vf has nonqualified deferred compensation plans in which liabilities accrued for the plans’ participants are based on market values of investment funds that are selected by the participants the risk of changes in the market values of the participants’ underlying investment selections is hedged by vf’s investment in a portfolio of securities that substantially mirrors the investment selections underlying the deferred compensation liabilities these vfowned investment securities are held in irrevocable trusts increases and decreases in deferred compensation liabilities are substantially offset by corresponding increases and decreases in the market value of vf’s investments resulting in a negligible net exposure to our operating results and financial position 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to accurately and fairly report vf’s operating results and financial position in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states we apply these accounting policies in a consistent manner our significant accounting policies are summarized in note a to the consolidated financial statements 

the application of these accounting policies requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses contingent assets and liabilities and related disclosures these estimates and assumptions are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances we evaluate these estimates and assumptions and may retain outside consultants to assist in our evaluation in areas such as allocation of purchase price of acquired businesses equity compensation or retirement benefits if actual results ultimately differ from previous estimates the revisions are included in results of operations in the period in which the actual amounts become known 

we believe the following accounting policies involve the most significant management judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements or are the most sensitive to change from outside factors we have discussed the application of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 

  inventories 

our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value cost includes all material labor and overhead costs incurred to manufacture or purchase the finished goods overhead allocated to manufactured product is based on the normal capacity of our plants and does not include amounts related to idle capacity or abnormal production inefficiencies market value is based on a detailed review at least quarterly of all inventories on the basis of individual stylesizecolor stockkeeping units “skus” to identify slow moving or excess products discontinued and tobediscontinued products and offquality merchandise this review matches inventory on hand plus current production and purchase commitments with current and expected future sales orders for those units in inventory that are identified as slowmoving or in excess we estimate their market value based on historical experience and current realization trends this evaluation performed using a systematic and consistent methodology requires forecasts of future demand market conditions and selling prices if the forecasted market value on an individual sku basis is less than cost we provide an allowance to reflect the lower value of that inventory this methodology recognizes inventory exposures on an individual sku basis at the time such losses are evident rather than at the time goods are actually sold historically these estimates of future demand and selling prices have not varied significantly from actual results due to our timely identification and rapid disposal of these reduced value inventories 

longlived assets 

our depreciation policies for property plant and equipment and our amortization policies for definitelived intangible assets reflect judgments on the estimated economic lives of these assets we review these assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable we measure recoverability of the carrying value of these assets by comparison with estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets this review requires estimates and assumptions about the forecasted amount and duration of future cash flows and residual value if any attributable to the assets being tested these evaluations have not resulted in any significant impairment charges during the past three years 

we evaluate indefinitelived trademark intangible assets and goodwill in all business units at least annually or more frequently if there is an indication of possible impairment we measure recoverability of the carrying value of these assets by comparison with estimated discounted cash flows attributable to the trademark or the business to which the goodwill relates for each of the last three years the indicated fair value of the indefinitelived trademark assets and goodwill in the business units exceeded the respective carrying amount of those assets 

  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions or if we were to decide to discontinue use of a trademark or to dispose of a business we may be exposed to an impairment charge related to certain assets or goodwill 

we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to the underlying tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values with any excess recorded as goodwill the process of assigning fair values particularly to acquired intangible assets is highly subjective as several of the fair value assessments are based on forecasts of future cash flows we use the same assumptions for assigning fair values to these assets that we used for evaluation of the business acquisition 

stock options 

in connection with the adoption of statement 123r in 2005 we began using a lattice optionpricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees and nonemployee members of the board of directors we believe that a lattice model provides a more refined estimate of the fair value of options than the blackscholes model used in prior years more specifically a lattice model can better incorporate i historical patterns and future assumptions about the exercise of stock options done separately by groups of options holders in relation to changes in the price of vf common stock and ii inputs that vary over time such as assumptions for interest rates and volatility we performed a rigorous review of all assumptions and believe that the assumptions employed in our 2006 valuation are reflective of our outstanding options and underlying common stock and of our groups of option participants our lattice valuation is based on the assumptions listed in note p to the consolidated financial statements 

one of the critical assumptions in the valuation process is estimating the expected average life of the options before exercise in 2006 and 2005 we based our estimates on evaluations of the historical and expected option exercise patterns for each of several groups of option holders that have historically exhibited different option exercise patterns these evaluations included i voluntary stock option exercise patterns based on a combination of changes in the price of vf common stock and periods of time that options are outstanding before exercise and ii involuntary exercise patterns resulting from turnover retirement and mortality the average life of stock options was less in 2004 due to different employee exercise behaviors caused primarily by higher employee turnover related to restructuring actions taken 

  volatility is another critical assumption requiring judgment in 2006 and 2005 we based our estimate of future volatility on a combination of implied and historical volatility implied volatility was based on publicly traded atthemoney options on vf common stock we measured historical volatility over a ten year period corresponding to the contractual term of the options using daily stock price observations our assumption for valuation purposes was that volatility will start at a level equal to the implied volatility and gradually increase to the historical volatility over the ten year option term the assumption for volatility was higher in 2004 because the assumption in that year was based only on historical volatility 

pension obligations 

vf sponsors defined benefit pension plans as a key retirement benefit for most domestic employees employed on or before december 31 2004 the selection of appropriate actuarial assumptions for determination of our accumulated and projected pension benefit liabilities and of our annual pension expense is significant due to the long time period over which benefits are accrued and paid we review annually the principal economic actuarial assumptions summarized in note n to the consolidated financial statements and modify them based on current rates and trends we update annually participant demographics and the amount and timing of benefit payments we also periodically review and modify as necessary other plan assumptions such as rates of retirement termination death and disability specifically during 2006 we updated the assumptions for future compensation increases retirement and turnover and during 2005 we updated the mortality assumption to a version of the rp 2000 mortality table that includes a provision for improvements in life expectancy through 2015 we believe these assumptions are reflective of the employee base covered by the plans and represent the best estimate of the plans’ future experience actual results may vary from the actuarial assumptions used 

one of the critical assumptions used in the actuarial model is the discount rate the discount rate is used to estimate the present value of our accumulated and projected benefit obligations at each valuation date we evaluate our discount rate assumption at each annual valuation date and adjust it as necessary based on current market interest rates we select our discount rate based on matching high quality corporate bond yields to the projected benefit payments and duration of obligations for participants in our pension plans we use the population of us corporate bonds rated ‘aa’ by moody’s investors service over 500 such bonds and exclude the highest and lowest yielding bonds the plans’ projected benefit payments are matched to spot interest rates 

  over the expected payment period and a present value is developed that produces a single equivalent discount rate that recognizes our plans’ distinct liability characteristics we believe our 2006 discount rate of 60 appropriately reflects current market conditions and the longterm nature of projected benefit payments to participants in our pension plans the discount rate for our plans may be higher than rates used for plans at some other companies because of our plans’ higher percentage of female participants with a longer life expectancy and higher percentage of inactive participants with vested benefits who will not begin receiving benefits for many years 

another critical assumption of the actuarial model is the expected longterm rate of return on investment assets in our pension trust because the rate of return is a longterm assumption it generally does not change significantly each year this rate is based on several factors including the mix of investment assets historic and projected market returns on those assets and current market conditions our rate of return assumption was 825 in 2006 and 850 in 2005 and 2004 which were all less than our actual compounded annual return over the preceding 15 years the rate of return assumption was lowered in 2006 based on a current evaluation of market conditions and projected market returns 

the sensitivity of changes in valuation assumptions on our annual pension expense and on our plans’ projected benefit obligations “pbo” all other factors being equal is illustrated by the following 

 

differences between actual results and actuarial assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods during the last several years actual results have differed significantly from actuarial assumptions resulting in 1953 million of accumulated net unrecognized actuarial 52 

  

losses at our 2006 valuation date these accumulated losses arose primarily because i our pension plan liabilities increased substantially as a result of the overall decline in the discount rate from 75 in 2001 to 60 in 2006 and ii although our actual investment return on pension plan assets exceeded the actuarially assumed rate in the last three years significant investment losses were incurred in 2002 and 2001 due to the overall decline in the securities markets our policy is to amortize unrecognized actuarial gains and losses to pension expense as follows amounts in excess of 20 of pbo at the beginning of the year are amortized over five years amounts totaling 10 to 20 of pbo are amortized over 10 years and amounts totaling less than 10 of the lower of investment assets or pbo at the beginning of the year are not amortized 

the cost of pension benefits earned by our employees commonly called “service cost” has averaged 217 million per year over the last three years however pension expense recognized in our financial statements over that period has significantly exceeded the average annual service cost our recorded pension expense was 375 million in 2006 351 million in 2005 and 496 million including a partial plan curtailment charge of 71 million in 2004 expense in each of the last three years was higher than the average annual service cost because those years included a significant cost component for amortization of accumulated net unrecognized actuarial losses as discussed in the preceding paragraph however our pension expense for 2007 is expected to decrease to approximately 13 million due to significant discretionary funding contributions of 75 million and 55 million in january 2006 and 2005 respectively and improved investment performance 

our projected benefit obligations exceeded the fair value of plan assets at our most recent valuation date accordingly under the provisions of statement 158 which was effective at the end of 2006 we recorded a pension liability of 1468 million representing the underfunded status of our two defined benefit pension plans the amount of the liability could change significantly in future years depending on securities market fluctuations interest rates and the level of vf contributions to the plan 

effective december 31 2004 vf’s domestic defined benefit plans were amended to close the existing plans to new entrants the amendments did not affect the benefits of current plan participants or their accrual of future benefits domestic employees hired after that date plus employees at certain acquired businesses not covered by those plans now participate in a new defined contribution arrangement with vf contributing amounts based on a percentage of eligible compensation funds contributed under this new benefit arrangement are invested as 

  directed by the participants this defined contribution feature did not have a significant effect on the 2006 expense for our defined benefit pension plans over a period of years however the expense of our defined benefit plans is expected to decline as a percentage of our total retirement benefit expense in addition the yeartoyear variability of our retirement benefit expense should also decrease 

income taxes 

vf’s income tax returns are regularly examined by federal state and foreign tax authorities these audits may result in proposed adjustments we have reviewed all issues raised upon examination as well as any exposure for issues that may be raised in future examinations and have recorded amounts that reflect our best estimates of the probable outcomes related to any such matters such judgments and estimates may change based on audit settlements court cases and interpretation of tax laws and regulations adjustments are recorded when these events occur we do not anticipate any material impact on earnings from the ultimate resolution of income tax uncertainties there are no accruals for general or unknown tax expenses 

we have recorded deferred income tax assets related to operating loss and capital loss carryforwards if in our judgment it appears that we will not be able to generate sufficient taxable income or capital gains to offset losses during the carryforward periods we have recorded valuation allowances to reduce those deferred tax assets to amounts expected to be ultimately realized an adjustment to income tax expense would be required in a future period if we determine that the amount of deferred tax assets to be realized differs from the net recorded amount 

we have not provided united states income taxes on a portion of our foreign subsidiaries’ undistributed earnings because we intend to invest those earnings indefinitely if we were to decide to remit those earnings to the united states in a future period our provision for income taxes could increase in that period during 2005 we repatriated certain foreign undistributed earnings pursuant to the american jobs creation act of 2004 which contained provisions for a temporary incentive for repatriation of foreign earnings and accordingly recorded the incremental income tax expense related to the repatriation in our 2005 financial statements 

the balance sheet classifications and amounts of accrued income taxes related to assets and liabilities of acquired companies were based on assumptions that could change depending on the ultimate resolution of certain tax matters since these income tax accruals were established in the allocation of the purchase price of acquired businesses future changes in these amounts could result in adjustments to goodwill 

in june 2006 the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of fasb statement no 109 “fin 48” which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income tax positions fin 48 prescribes the recognition threshold an income tax provision is required to meet before being recorded in the financial statements and provides guidance on classification and disclosures of tax positions the provisions of fin 48 are effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 vf is currently evaluating the impact of fin 48 on its financial statements when fin 48 is adopted in the first quarter of 2007 the adjustment to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and to beginning retained earnings is not expected to be material

the sportswear coalition also includes the kipling â brand business in north america acquired in late 2004 as part of the kipling acquisition in europe 

retail operations 

vfoperated retail stores are an integral part of vf’s strategy for building its brands providing visibility for its products and brands and enabling vf to stay close to the needs of core consumers in addition outlet stores serve an important role in vf’s overall inventory management by allowing vf to effectively sell a significant portion of discontinued and outofseason products at better prices than are otherwise available 

vf currently operates approximately 305 fullprice stores and 110 outlet stores around the world that sell specific brands including the north face â  vans â  napapijri â  kipling â  nautica â  lee â and wrangler â  also vf has granted the right to licensees and distributors to sell the jansport â  eastpak â  the north face â  vans â  napapijri â and kipling â brands through over 200 independentlyoperated stores located primarily in europe and asia 

in addition to the monobrand retail outlet operations discussed above vf operates approximately 110 outlet stores across the united states and europe that sell a broad selection of vf products sales and profits of vf products sold through these outlet stores are reported as part of the operating results of the respective coalitions 

retail sales accounted for approximately 12 and 10 of vf’s consolidated total revenues in 2005 and 2004 respectively vf management expects the retail business to continue to grow and is planning a 

capital investment of approximately 35 million in retail space during 2006 

in addition vf offers products directly to the consumer via the internet products sold through the internet include uniforms imagewear coalition and vans â footwear outdoor coalition internet sales in 2005 were approximately 1 of vf’s consolidated total revenues 

licensing arrangements 

in connection with vf’s business strategy of expanding market penetration of its owned brands vf enters into licensing agreements for certain products and geographic regions if such arrangements provide more effective manufacturing distribution and marketing of such products than could be achieved internally these licensing arrangements relate to a broad range of vf brands and are for fixed terms that may include renewal options in addition certain foreign licensees and distributors have been granted the right to open retail stores under the licensed brand name and sell only licensed branded products in these stores each licensee pays royalties to vf based upon its sales of branded products with most agreements providing for a minimum royalty these payments generally range from 3 to 7 of the licensing partners’ net sales of the licensed products 

in addition licensees are generally required to spend an amount between 1 and 5 of their sales to advertise vf’s products in some cases these advertising amounts are remitted to vf for advertising on behalf of the licensees vf provides support to these business partners and seeks to preserve the integrity of brand names by taking an active role in the design quality control advertising marketing and distribution of each licensed product most of which are subject to vf’s prior approval and continuing oversight gross royalty income was 74 million and 70 million in 2005 and 2004 respectively 

while licensing activities exist for all coalitions the largest component of this business approximately 43 of gross royalty income is in the sportswear coalition the nautica â   brand is licensed in the united states for apparel categories not produced by vf eg tailored clothing dress shirts neckwear accessories women’s swimwear and for nonapparel categories eg home furnishings fragrances watches eyewear in addition nautica â apparel and certain nonapparel products are licensed for sale in over 100 countries outside the us wholesale sales of nautica â branded products by licensees are in excess of 420 million annually 

vf has also entered into license agreements to use the trademarks of others apparel is marketed under licenses granted by the national football league major league baseball the national basketball association the national hockey league nascar nike inc and harleydavidson motor company inc some of these license arrangements contain minimum annual licensing and advertising requirements some are for a short term and may not contain specific renewal options management believes that the loss of any license would not have a material adverse effect on vf 

raw materials and sourcing 

raw materials include fabrics made from cotton synthetics and blends of cotton and synthetic yarn as well as thread and trim product identification buttons zippers snaps and lace these raw materials are purchased from numerous suppliers while in some cases vf has obtained fixed price commitments for up to one year specific purchase obligations with suppliers are typically limited to the succeeding two to six months vf does not have any longterm supplier contracts for the purchase of raw materials however in connection with the sale of vf’s childrenswear business in 2004 vf has committed to purchase a total of approximately 130 million of finished product for sale through its owned outlet stores with a minimum of 15 million per year through 2013 

for most domestic operations vf purchases fabric from several domestic and international suppliers in conjunction with scheduled production purchased fabric is cut and sewn into finished garments in vfowned domestic and offshore manufacturing facilities located in mexico and the caribbean basin in addition vf contracts the sewing of vfowned raw materials into finished product to independent contractors primarily in mexico and the caribbean basin 

to an increasing extent vf is using independent contractors in asia and the caribbean basin who own the raw materials and provide only finished readyforsale products to vf these contractors are engaged through sourcing hubs in asia and miami the miami location handles the majority of the sourcing for the western hemisphere these hubs are responsible for the product procurement product quality assurance and supplier management and handling functions all products in the outdoor and sportswear coalitions as well as many items in vf’s other operating units are sourced through these operations 

all contracted production must meet vf’s high quality standards further all independent contractors who manufacture apparel products for vf must be precertified and sign a terms of engagement agreement prior to performance of any production on vf’s behalf these requirements provide strict standards covering hours of work age of workers health and safety conditions and conformity with local laws vf maintains an ongoing program to audit compliance with dedicated and outsourced staff 

the current sourcing strategy for products sold in the united states allows vf to balance its needs with a mix of vfowned and contracted production in the western hemisphere combined with contracted production primarily from asia product obtained from western hemisphere contractors has somewhat higher cost but gives vf greater flexibility shorter lead times and lower inventory levels as compared with production obtained from the far east and other more distant resources this combination of vfowned and contracted production along with different geographic regions and cost structures provides a balanced approach to product sourcing 

over the last five years vf closed a significant number of manufacturing facilities in the united states and shifted production to lower cost locations as a result of this shift in sourcing the amount of sales in the united states derived from products manufactured in lower cost locations outside the united states has increased each year over the last three years during 2005 only 1 of domestic net sales were manufactured in vfowned plants in the united states in contrast at the end of 2000 approximately onethird of vf’s products sold in the united states were manufactured in vfowned plants in the united states today of the total products supporting sales to customers in the united states 31 were manufactured in vfowned facilities in mexico and the caribbean basin and 68 were obtained from contractors primarily in asia 

for vf’s international businesses fabric thread and trim are purchased from several international suppliers in the european jeanswear operations fabric is cut and sewn into finished garments in owned plants located in malta poland and turkey with the balance sourced from independent contractors in the middle east africa and the far east in the international intimate apparel businesses fabric is sewn into finished garments in owned plants in spain and tunisia with the remainder manufactured by independent contractors to obtain a more balanced sourcing mix european jeanswear and intimate apparel sourcing has been shifting from owned plants in western europe to lower cost owned and contracted production outside of western europe for the european outdoor coalition businesses nearly all products are sourced from contractors located in asia 

vf did not experience difficulty in obtaining its raw material and contracting production needs during 2005 management does not anticipate difficulties in obtaining its raw materials and contracting 

production requirements during 2006 the loss of any one supplier or contractor would not have a significant adverse effect on vf’s business 

imports and import restrictions 

vf is exposed to certain risks of doing business outside of the united states vf imports goods from vfowned facilities in mexico and the caribbean basin and from suppliers in those areas and in asia europe africa and the middle east these import transactions had been subject to the constraints imposed by bilateral agreements between the united states and a number of governments these agreements were negotiated either under the framework established by the world trade organization “wto” or other applicable statutes and they imposed quotas that limited the amount of certain categories of merchandise from these countries that could be imported into the united states and the european union all restrictions under these agreements had ended as of december 31 2004 

pursuant to a 1995 agreement on textiles and clothing under the wto effective january 1 2005 the united states and other wto member countries were required with few exceptions to remove quotas on goods from wto member countries the complete removal of quotas may benefit vf as well as other apparel companies in the long run by allowing them to source products without quantitative limitation from any country the only significant exceptions to the removal of quota that could affect vf are vietnam and china vietnam is not a wto member and is therefore still subject to quota on certain products to various countries safeguard quotas pursuant to the terms of china’s accession agreement to the wto have been imposed against chinese exports and will last through 2008 these new restraints include products that vf imports and sells however vf management was well aware of developments with regards to safeguards and made sourcing decisions accordingly any effect of the imposition of safeguards is not expected to be material to vf 

management continually monitors new developments and risks related to duties tariffs and quotas in response to the changing import environment resulting from the elimination of quotas management has chosen to continue its balanced approach to manufacturing and sourcing vf limits its sourcing exposure through among other measures 1 extensive geographic diversification with a mix of vfoperated and contracted production 2 utilization of tariff preference and free trade agreements to lower customs duties 3 allocation of production to merchandise categories where the free flow of product is available and 4 shifts of production among countries and contractors vf will continue to manage its supply chain from a global perspective and adjust as needed to changes in the global production environment 

seasonality 

the apparel industry in the united states has four primary retail selling seasons — spring summer backtoschool and holiday while international markets typically have spring and fall selling seasons sales to retail customers generally precede the retail selling seasons although demand peaks have been reduced as more products are being sold directly to consumers or to retailers on a replenishment basis 

overall with its diversified product offerings vf’s operating results are somewhat seasonal on a quarterly basis consolidated total revenues for 2005 ranged from a low of approximately 22 of full year revenues in the second quarter to a high of 28 in the third quarter this disparity results primarily from the sales of outdoor apparel and equipment which are more seasonal in nature approximately 36 of outdoor apparel and equipment sales occurred in the third quarter 

working capital requirements vary throughout the year working capital increases during the first half of the year as inventory builds to support peak shipping periods and accordingly decreases during the second half cash provided by operating activities is substantially higher in the second half of the year 

due to higher net income and reduced working capital requirements during that period 

advertising 

vf supports its brands through extensive advertising and promotional programs vf advertises on national and local radio and television and in consumer and trade publications and participates in cooperative advertising on a shared cost basis with major retailers in radio television and various print media vf sponsors various sporting music and other special events in addition pointofsale fixtures and signage are used to promote products at the retail level vf spent 337 million advertising and promoting its products in 2005 an increase of 7 from the 2004 level 

vf also participates in various retail customer incentive programs these incentive programs with retailers include stated discounts discounts based on the retailer agreeing to advertise or promote the products or margin support funds vf also offers sales incentive programs directly to consumers in the form of rebate and coupon offers these sales incentive offers with retailers and with consumers are recognized as sales discounts in arriving at reported net sales

 item 1a risk factors 

the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating vf’s business and the forwardlooking statements contained in this form 10k any of the following risks could materially adversely affect vf’s business its operating results and its financial condition 

risks specific to vf corporation 

a substantial portion of vf’s revenues and gross profit is derived from a small number of large customers the loss of any of these customers could substantially reduce vf’s profits 

a few of vf’s customers account for a significant portion of revenues sales to vf’s ten largest customers were 34 of revenues in fiscal 2005 with walmart accounting for 16 of revenues sales are generally on a purchase order basis and vf does not have longterm agreements with any of its customers a decision by any of vf’s major customers to decrease significantly the number of products purchased from vf could substantially reduce revenues and have a material adverse effect on vf’s financial condition and results of operations moreover the retail industry has experienced consolidation and other ownership changes such as the merger of federated department stores inc and the may department stores company and the merger of sears roebuck and company and kmart holding corporation in 2005 in the future retailers may further consolidate undergo restructurings or reorganizations realign their affiliations or reposition their stores’ target market these developments could decrease the number of stores that carry vf’s products or increase the ownership concentration within the retail industry these changes could both impact vf’s opportunities in the market and increase vf’s reliance on a smaller number of large customers 

vf’s business could be adversely affected by financial instability experienced by its customers 

during the past several years various retailers have experienced significant financial difficulties which in some cases have resulted in bankruptcies liquidations and store closings vf sells a large portion of its products on open account to national and regional department midtier and mass market stores in the united states the financial difficulties of a customer could result in reduced business with that customer vf may also assume higher credit risk relating to receivables of a customer experiencing financial difficulty if these developments occur vf’s inability to shift sales to other customers or to collect on its trade accounts receivable from one of its major customers could substantially reduce vf’s income and have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations 

the apparel industry is highly competitive and vf’s success depends on its ability to respond to constantly changing fashion trends and consumer demand reduced sales or prices resulting from competition could have a material adverse effect on vf 

vf competes with numerous domestic and foreign brands and manufacturers of apparel in addition vf competes directly with the private label brands of its wholesale customers vf’s ability to compete within the apparel and footwear industries depends on its ability to 

 

 

vf attempts to minimize risks associated with competition including risks related to changing style trends and product acceptance by studying retail sales trends the failure however to compete effectively or to keep pace with rapidly changing markets and trends could have a material adverse effect on vf’s business financial condition and results of operations in addition if vf misjudges fashion trends and market conditions vf could be faced with significant excess inventories for some products that it may have to sell at a loss and missed opportunities with others that may result in lost sales 

vf’s profitability may decline as a result of increasing pressure on margins 

vf’s industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors including intense competition consolidation in the retail industry pressure from retailers to reduce the costs of products and changes in consumer demand these factors may cause vf to reduce its sales prices to retailers and consumers which could cause vf’s gross margin to decline if vf is unable to offset price reductions with comparable reductions in its operating costs if vf’s sales prices decline and vf fails to sufficiently reduce its product costs or operating expenses or increase its selling prices vf’s profitability will decline this could have a material adverse effect on vf’s results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

vf may not succeed in implementing its growth strategy 

one of vf’s key strategic objectives is growth vf seeks to grow through organic growth and acquisitions building new growing lifestyle brands expanding its share with winning customers stretching its brands and customers to new geographies fueling the growth by leveraging its supply chain and information technology capabilities across vf expanding its directtoconsumer business and building new growth enablers by identifying and developing high potential employees vf may have difficulty identifying acquisition targets and it may not be able to successfully integrate a newly acquired business or achieve any expected cost savings or synergies from such integration vf may not be able to achieve planned cost savings from its ongoing businesses vf may not be able to expand its share with winning customers expand its brands geographically or achieve the expected results from its supply chain initiatives vf may also have difficulty recruiting or developing qualified managers the failure to implement its growth strategies may have a material adverse effect on vf’s business 

if vf encounters problems with its distribution system vf’s ability to deliver its products to the market would be adversely affected 

vf relies on its distribution facilities to warehouse and using its own employees or in some cases independent contractors to ship product to its customers vf’s distribution system includes computer controlled and automated equipment which means its operations are complicated and may be subject to a number of risks related to security or computer viruses the proper operation of software and hardware electronic or power interruptions or other system failures because substantially all of vf’s products are distributed from a relatively small number of locations vf’s operations could also be interrupted by earthquakes floods fires or other natural disasters near its distribution centers vf maintains business interruption insurance but it may not adequately protect vf from the adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in vf’s distribution facilities such as the longterm loss of customers or an erosion of brand image in addition vf’s distribution capacity is dependent on the timely performance of services by third parties including the transportation of product to and from its distribution facilities if vf encounters problems with its distribution system vf’s ability to meet customer expectations manage inventory complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies could be materially adversely affected 

vf relies significantly on information technology any inadequacy interruption integration failure or security failure of that technology could harm vf’s ability to effectively operate its business 

vf’s ability to effectively manage and operate its business depends significantly on its information technology systems the failure of these systems to operate effectively problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems difficulty in integrating new systems or systems of acquired businesses or a breach in security of these systems could adversely impact the operations of vf’s business it could also require significant expenditures to remediate any such failure problem or breach 

vf uses foreign suppliers and manufacturing facilities for a substantial portion of its finished products and raw materials which poses risks to vf’s business operations 

during fiscal 2005 in excess of 65 of vf’s products sold were produced by and purchased or procured from independent manufacturers located in countries in the far east indian subcontinent caribbean and central america and more than 30 were produced by vfowned and operated manufacturing facilities located in europe mexico and the caribbean although no single supplier and no one country is critical to vf’s production needs any of the following could materially and adversely affect vf’s ability to produce or deliver its products and as a result have a material adverse effect on vf’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

if vf’s suppliers fail to use acceptable ethical business practices vf’s business could suffer 

vf requires third party suppliers to operate in compliance with applicable laws rules and regulations regarding working conditions employment practices and environmental compliance additionally vf requires all suppliers making vfbranded apparel whether directly for vf or for its licensees to comply with its terms of engagement and global compliance principles vf’s staff and third parties retained for such purposes periodically visit and audit the operations of vf’s independent manufacturers and owned and operated facilities to determine compliance however vf does not control its independent manufacturers or their labor and other business practices if one of vf’s manufacturers violates labor or other laws or implements labor or other business practices that are generally regarded as unethical in the united states the shipment of finished products to vf could be interrupted orders could be cancelled relationships could be terminated and vf’s reputation could be damaged any of these events could have a material adverse effect on vf’s revenues and consequently its results of operations 

vf’s results of operations could be materially harmed if vf is unable to accurately forecast demand for its products 

vf often places orders for products with its manufacturers before its customers’ orders are firm therefore if vf fails to accurately forecast customer demand vf may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of product to deliver to its customers factors that could affect vf’s ability to accurately forecast demand for its products include 

 

inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory writedowns and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices which would have an adverse effect on vf’s results of operations and financial condition in addition if vf underestimates the demand for its products its manufacturing facilities or third party manufacturers may not be able to produce products to meet vf’s customer requirements and this could result in delays in the shipment of its products and its ability to recognize revenue as well as damage to its reputation and customer relationships there can be no assurance that vf will be able to successfully manage inventory demand to meet future order and reorder requirements 

the loss of members of vf’s executive management and other key employees could have a material adverse effect on its business 

vf depends on the services and management experience of its executive officers who have substantial experience and expertise in vf’s business vf also depends on other key employees involved in the operation of its business competition for qualified personnel in the apparel industry is intense the unexpected loss of services of one or more of these individuals could materially adversely affect vf 

vf may be unable to protect its trademarks and other intellectual property rights 

vf’s trademarks and other intellectual property rights are important to its success and its competitive position vf is susceptible to others imitating its products and infringing its intellectual property rights with the shift in product mix to higher priced brands vf is more susceptible to infringement of its intellectual property rights some of vf’s brands such as the north face â  jansport â  nautica â  wrangler â and lee â brands enjoy significant worldwide consumer recognition and the generally higher pricing of such branded products creates additional risk of counterfeiting and infringement 

imitation or counterfeiting of vf’s products or infringement of its intellectual property rights could diminish the value of its brands or otherwise adversely affect vf revenues actions vf has taken to establish and protect its trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of its products by others or to prevent others from seeking to invalidate its trademarks or block sales of vf’s products as a violation of the trademarks and intellectual property rights of others 

the value of vf’s intellectual property could diminish if others assert rights in or ownership of trademarks and other intellectual property rights of vf’s or in trademarks that are similar to vf’s or trademarks that vf licenses andor markets vf may be unable to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to its satisfaction in some cases there may be trademark owners who have prior rights to vf’s trademarks because the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states in other cases there may be holders who have prior rights to similar trademarks vf is from time to time involved in opposition and cancellation proceedings with respect to some items of its intellectual property 

vf obtains licensing royalties and relies on its licensees to maintain the value of its brands 

although only a relatively small portion of vf’s revenues 74 million or 11 were derived from licensing royalties in 2005 and although vf generally has significant control over its licensee’s products and advertising vf relies on its licensees for among other things operational and financial controls over their businesses failure of its licensees to successfully market licensed products or vf’s inability to replace its existing licensees could adversely affect vf’s revenues both directly from reduced royalties received and indirectly from reduced sales of its other products risks are also associated with a licensee’s ability to 

 

in addition vf relies on its licensees to help preserve the value of its brands although vf makes every attempt to protect its brands through among other things approval rights over design production processes and quality packaging merchandising distribution advertising and promotion of its products vf cannot completely control the use by its licensees of each of its licensed brands the misuse of a brand by a licensee could have a material adverse effect on that brand 

risks applicable to the apparel industry 

vf’s revenues and profits depend on the level of consumer spending for apparel which is sensitive to general economic conditions and other factors affecting consumer confidence 

the apparel industry has historically been subject to substantial cyclical variations and is particularly affected by adverse trends in the general economy the success of vf’s operations depends on consumer spending consumer spending is influenced by a number of factors including actual and perceived economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as unemployment and wages business conditions interest rates energy prices availability of credit and tax rates in the international national regional and local markets where vf’s products are sold any significant deterioration in general economic conditions recession or increases in interest rates could reduce the level of consumer spending and inhibit consumers’ use of credit a significant decline in the securities markets could materially affect consumer confidence the financial condition of vf’s customers and its operating costs through higher contributions to its pension plan in addition natural disasters war terrorist activity or the threat of war or terrorist activity could adversely affect consumer spending and thereby have a material adverse effect on vf’s financial condition and results of operations 

fluctuations in the price availability and quality of raw materials could increase costs and cause delay 

fluctuations in the price availability and quality of the fabrics or other raw materials used by vf in its manufactured apparel could have a material adverse effect on vf’s cost of sales or its ability to meet its customers’ demands the prices for such fabrics depend on demand and market prices for the raw materials used to produce them particularly cotton the price and availability of such raw materials may fluctuate significantly depending on many factors including crop yields and weather patterns in the future vf may not be able to pass all or a portion of such higher raw materials prices on to its customers 

vf’s business is exposed to foreign currency fluctuations 

approximately 25 of vf’s total revenues is derived from international markets vf’s foreign businesses operate in functional currencies other than the united states dollar assets and liabilities in these foreign businesses are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in addition vf sources and manufactures much of its products overseas as a result the cost of these products may be affected by changes in the value of the relevant currencies changes in currency exchange rates may also affect the us dollar value of the foreign currency denominated prices at which vf’s international businesses sell products furthermore vf’s international sales and licensing revenue are derived from sales in foreign currencies although vf hedges some exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange rates arising in the ordinary course of business foreign currency fluctuations could have a material adverse impact on its financial condition and results of operations 

vf’s ability to sell products in international markets may be affected by legal regulatory political and economic risks 

vf’s ability to capitalize on growth in new international markets and to maintain the current level of operations in its existing international markets is subject to risks associated with international operations these include the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws and regulations unexpected changes in regulatory requirements new tariffs or other barriers to some international markets 

vf cannot predict whether quotas duties taxes or other similar restrictions will be imposed by the united states the european union japan or other countries upon the import or export of its products in the future or what effect any of these actions would have on vf’s business financial condition or results of operations changes in regulatory geopolitical policies and other factors may adversely affect vf’s business or may require vf to modify its current business practices

  raw materials and sourcing raw materials include fabrics made from cotton synthetics and blends of cotton and synthetic yarn as well as thread and trim product identification buttons zippers snaps and lace these raw materials are purchased from numerous suppliers while in some cases vf has obtained fixed price commitments for up to one year specific purchase obligations with suppliers are typically limited to the succeeding two to six months vf does not have any longterm supplier contracts for the purchase of raw materials however in connection with the sale of vf’s childrenswear business in 2004 vf has committed to purchase 15 million of finished goods per year through 2013 for most domestic operations vf purchases fabric from several domestic and international suppliers in conjunction with scheduled production purchased fabric is cut and sewn into finished garments in vfowned domestic and offshore manufacturing facilities located in mexico and the caribbean basin in addition vf contracts the sewing of vfowned raw materials to independent contractors primarily in mexico and the caribbean basin to an increasing extent vf is using contractors in asia and the caribbean basin who own the raw materials and provide only finished readyforsale products to vf over the last five years vf closed a significant number of manufacturing facilities in the united states and shifted production to lower cost locations as a result of this shift in sourcing the amount of sales in the united states derived from products manufactured in lower cost locations outside the united states has increased each year over the last three years during 2004 3 of the units vf sold in the united states were manufactured in vfowned plants in the united states in contrast at the end of 2000 approximately onethird of vf’s products sold in the united states were manufactured in vfowned plants in the united states today of the total products supporting sales to customers in the united states 38 were manufactured in vfowned facilities in mexico and the caribbean basin and 59 were obtained from contractors primarily in asia the current sourcing strategy for products sold in the united states allows vf to balance its needs with a mix of vfowned and contracted production in the western hemisphere combined with contracted production primarily from asia product obtained from the western hemisphere has somewhat higher cost but gives vf greater flexibility shorter lead times and lower inventory levels as compared with production obtained from the far east and other more distant resources this combination of vfowned and contracted production along with different geographic regions and cost structures provides a balanced approach to product sourcing in 2005 a new sourcing hub will be opening in miami this facility is expected to handle all of the sourcing for the western hemisphere for vf’s international businesses fabric thread and trim are purchased from several international suppliers in the european jeanswear operations fabric is cut and sewn into finished garments in owned plants located in malta poland and turkey with the balance sourced from independent contractors in the middle east africa and the far east in the international intimate apparel businesses fabric is sewn into finished garments in owned plants in spain france and tunisia with the remainder manufactured by independent contractors to obtain a more balanced sourcing mix european jeanswear and intimate apparel sourcing has been shifting from owned plants in western europe to lower cost owned and contracted production outside of western europe for the european outdoor coalition businesses nearly all products are sourced from contractors located in asia all contracted production must meet vf’s high quality standards further all independent contractors who manufacture products for vf must be precertified and adhere to the vf contractor terms of engagement these requirements provide strict standards covering hours of work age of 10 

  workers health and safety conditions and conformity with local laws each new contractor must be inspected and sign a terms of engagement agreement prior to performance of any production on vf’s behalf vf periodically audits compliance with these standards vf did not experience difficulty in obtaining its raw material and contracting production needs during 2004 management does not anticipate difficulties in obtaining its raw materials and contracting production requirements during 2005 the loss of any one supplier or contractor would not have a significant adverse effect on vf’s business imports and import restrictions vf is exposed to certain risks of doing business outside of the united states vf imports goods from vfowned facilities in mexico and the caribbean basin and from suppliers in those areas and in asia europe and africa these import transactions had been subject to the constraints imposed by bilateral agreements between the united states and a number of governments these agreements were negotiated either under the framework established by the world trade organization “wto” or other applicable statutes and they imposed quotas that limited the amount of certain categories of merchandise from these countries that could be imported into the united states and the european union restrictions under these agreements ended on december 31 2004 pursuant to a 1995 agreement on textiles and clothing under the wto effective january 1 2005 the united states and other wto member countries were required with few exceptions to remove quotas on goods from wto member countries the complete removal of quotas would benefit vf as well as other apparel companies by allowing them to source products without quantitative limitation from any countries the only significant exceptions to the removal of quota that could affect vf are vietnam and china vietnam is not a wto member and is therefore still subject to quota on certain products to various countries it is possible for countries to restrict china with safeguard quotas pursuant to the terms of china’s accession agreement to the wto the united states is expected to use the safeguard quota mechanisms on certain products sometime during 2005 any of these actions could impact vf’s ability to import products but are monitored closely by our management to evaluate the possible business impact any effect of the imposition of safeguards is not expected to have a material impact on vf management continually monitors new developments and risks related to duties tariffs and quotas in response to the changing import environment resulting from the elimination of quotas management has chosen to continue its balanced approach to manufacturing and sourcing vf limits its sourcing exposure through among other measures 1 extensive geographic diversification with a mix of vfowned and contracted production 2 allocation of production to merchandise categories where the free flow of product is available and 3 shifts of production among countries and contractors vf will continue to manage its supply chain from a global perspective and adjust as needed to changes in the global production environment seasonality the apparel industry in the united states has four primary retail selling seasons — spring summer backtoschool and holiday while international markets typically have spring and fall selling seasons sales to retail customers generally precede the retail selling seasons although demand peaks have been reduced as more products are being sold on a replenishment basis overall with its diversified product offerings vf’s operating results are somewhat seasonal on a quarterly basis consolidated net sales for 2004 ranged from a low of approximately 21 of full year 11 

  sales in the second quarter to a high of 30 in the third quarter this disparity results primarily from the sales of outdoor apparel and equipment which are more seasonal in nature assuming we had owned vans napapijri and kipling for the full year in 2004 approximately 37 of outdoor apparel and equipment sales would have occurred in the third quarter in addition consolidated net sales for 2004 would have ranged from a low of approximately 22 in the second quarter to a high of 29 in the third quarter these percentages are relatively consistent with prior years working capital requirements vary throughout the year working capital increases during the first half of the year as inventory builds to support peak shipping periods and accordingly decreases during the second half cash provided by operations is substantially higher in the second half of the year due to higher net income and reduced working capital requirements during that period advertising vf supports its brands through extensive advertising and promotional programs vf advertises on national and local radio and television and in consumer and trade publications and participates in cooperative advertising on a shared cost basis with major retailers in radio television and various print media vf sponsors various sporting music and other special events in addition pointofsale fixtures and signage are used to promote products at the retail level vf spent 3141 million advertising and promoting its products in 2004 an increase of 21 from the 2003 level vf also participates in various retail customer incentive programs these incentive programs with retailers include stated discounts discounts based on the retailer agreeing to advertise or promote the products or margin support funds vf also offers sales incentive programs directly to consumers in the form of rebate and coupon offers these sales incentive offers with retailers and with consumers are recognized as sales discounts in arriving at reported net sales other matters   competitive factors vf’s business depends on its ability to stimulate consumer demand for its brands and products vf is wellpositioned to compete in the apparel industry by developing consumerdriven and innovative products at competitive prices producing high quality merchandise providing high levels of service ensuring product availability to the retail sales floor and enhancing recognition of its brands vf continually strives to improve on each of these areas many of vf’s brands have long histories and enjoy high recognition within their respective consumer segments although vf is one of the largest apparel companies in the world the apparel industry is highly competitive and consists of a number of domestic and foreign companies in most product categories there are numerous competing branded products and in many product categories there are competing specialty retailer branded products and private label products in certain product categories and geographic areas in which vf operates there may be several competitors that have more sales and assets than vf in those specific categories or geographic areas   trademarks trademarks have substantial value in the marketing of vf’s products vf has registered these trademarks in the united states and with governmental agencies in other countries where vf’s products are manufactured andor sold vf vigorously monitors and protects these trademarks against infringement and dilution where legally feasible and appropriate in addition vf grants 12

occupational apparel segment the company produces workwear career and safety apparel sold under the red kap ® horace small apparel company ® penn state textile ® and bulwark protective apparel ® labels in the united states over onehalf of these sales are to industrial laundries that in turn supply work clothes to employers primarily on a rental basis for onthejob wear by production service and whitecollar personnel products include work pants slacks work and dress shirts overalls jackets and smocks since industrial laundries maintain minimal inventories of work clothes a supplier’s ability to offer rapid delivery is an important factor in this market the company’s commitment to customer service supported by an automated central distribution center with several satellite locations has enabled customer orders to be filled within 24 hours of receipt and has helped the red kap ® brand obtain a significant share of the industrial laundry rental business the company’s business of selling workwear and career apparel to professional laundries has been declining in recent years led largely by workforce reductions in the domestic manufacturing sector this trend is expected to continue in addition there has been an ongoing consolidation of the industrial laundry industry with many of the companies’ customers placing greater reliance on their inhouse or contract manufacturing and thereby purchasing less from suppliers such as the company to offset some of this decline the company also markets corporate image uniforms and casual apparel through the vf
