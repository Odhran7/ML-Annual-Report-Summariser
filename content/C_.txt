21 securitizations and variable interest entities 

uses of special purpose entities 

a special purpose entity spe is an entity designed to fulfill a specific limited need of the company that organized it the principal uses of spes by citi are to assist clients in securitizing their financial assets and to create investment products for clients and to obtain liquidity and optimize capital efficiency by securitizing certain of citi’s financial assets spes may be organized in various legal forms including trusts partnerships or corporations in a securitization through the spe’s issuance of debt and equity instruments certificates commercial paper or other notes of indebtedness the company transferring assets to the spe converts all or a portion of those assets into cash before they would have been realized in the normal course of business these issuances are recorded on the balance sheet of the spe which may or may not be consolidated onto the balance sheet of the company that organized the spe 

investors usually have recourse only to the assets in the spe but may also benefit from other credit enhancements such as a collateral account a line of credit or a liquidity facility such as a liquidity put option or asset purchase agreement because of these enhancements the spe issuances typically obtain a more favorable credit rating than the transferor could obtain for its own debt issuances this results in less expensive financing costs than unsecured debt the spe may also enter into derivative contracts in order to convert the yield or currency of the underlying assets to match the needs of the spe investors or to limit or change the credit risk of the spe citigroup may be the provider of certain credit enhancements as well as the counterparty to any related derivative contracts 

most of citigroup’s spes are variable interest entities vies 

variable interest entities 

vies are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements investors that finance the vie through debt or equity interests or other counterparties providing other forms of support such as guarantees certain fee arrangements or certain types of derivative contracts are variable interest holders in the entity 

the variable interest holder if any that has a controlling financial interest in a vie is deemed to be the primary beneficiary and must consolidate the vie 

the company must evaluate each vie to understand the purpose and design of the entity the role the company had in the entity’s design and its involvement in the vie’s ongoing activities the company then must evaluate which activities most significantly impact the economic performance of the vie and who has the power to direct such activities 

for those vies where the company determines that it has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the vie’s economic performance the company must then evaluate its economic interests if any and determine whether it could absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the vie when evaluating whether the company has an obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant it considers the maximum exposure to such loss without consideration of probability such obligations could be in various forms including but not limited to debt and equity investments guarantees liquidity agreements and certain derivative contracts 

in various other transactions the company may i act as a derivative counterparty eg interest rate swap crosscurrency swap or purchaser of credit protection under a credit default swap or total return swap where the company pays the total return on certain assets to the spe ii act as underwriter or placement agent iii provide administrative trustee or other services or iv make a market in debt securities or other instruments issued by vies the company generally considers such involvement by itself not to be variable interests and thus not an indicator of power or potentially significant benefits or losses 

citigroup’s involvement with consolidated and unconsolidated vies with which the company holds significant variable interests or has continuing involvement through servicing a majority of the assets in a vie is presented below 





1 the definition of maximum exposure to loss is included in the text that follows this table 

2 included on citigroup’s december 31 2021 and 2020 consolidated balance sheet 

3 a significant unconsolidated vie is an entity in which the company has any variable interest or continuing involvement considered to be significant regardless of the likelihood of loss 

4 citigroup mortgage securitizations also include agency and nonagency private label resecuritization activities these resecuritization spes are not consolidated see “resecuritizations” below for further discussion 

5 included within this line are loans to thirdparty sponsored private equity funds which represent  100 billion and  78 billion in unconsolidated vie assets and  497 million and  425 million in maximum exposure to loss as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively 

the previous tables do not include 

• certain venture capital investments made by some of the company’s private equity subsidiaries as the company accounts for these investments in accordance with the investment company audit guide codified in asc 946 

• certain investment funds for which the company provides investment management services and personal estate trusts for which the company provides administrative trustee andor investment management services 

• certain thirdparty sponsored private equity funds to which the company provides secured credit facilities the company has no decisionmaking power and does not consolidate these funds some of which may meet the definition of a vie the company’s maximum exposure to loss is generally limited to a loan or lendingrelated commitment as of december 31 2021 and 2020 the company’s maximum exposure to loss related to these deals was  556 billion and  570 billion respectively for more information on these positions see notes 14 and 26 to the consolidated financial statements 

• certain vies structured by third parties in which the company holds securities in inventory as these investments are made on arm’slength terms 

• certain positions in mortgage and assetbacked securities held by the company which are classified as trading account assets or investments  in which the company has no other involvement with the related securitization entity deemed to be significant for more information on these positions see notes 13 and 24 to the consolidated financial statements 

• certain representations and warranties exposures in citigroup residential mortgage securitizations in which the original mortgage loan balances are no longer outstanding and 

• vies such as trust preferred securities trusts used in connection with the company’s funding activities the company does not have a variable interest in these trusts 

the asset balances for consolidated vies represent the carrying amounts of the assets consolidated by the company the carrying amount may represent the amortized cost or the current fair value of the assets depending on the classification of the asset eg loan or security and the associated accounting model ascribed to that classification 

the asset balances for unconsolidated vies in which the company has significant involvement represent the most current information available to the company in most cases the asset balances represent an amortized cost basis without regard to impairments unless fair value information is readily available to the company 

the maximum funded exposure represents the balance sheet carrying amount of the company’s investment in the vie it reflects the initial amount of cash invested in the vie adjusted for any accrued interest and cash principal payments received the carrying amount may also be adjusted for increases or declines in fair value or any impairment in value recognized in earnings the maximum exposure of unfunded positions represents the remaining undrawn committed amount including liquidity and credit facilities provided by the company or the notional amount of a derivative instrument considered to be a variable interest in certain transactions the company has entered into derivative instruments or other arrangements that are not considered variable interests in the vie eg interest rate swaps crosscurrency swaps or where the company is the purchaser of credit protection under a credit default swap or total return swap where the company pays the total return on certain assets to the spe receivables under such arrangements are not included in the maximum exposure amounts 

funding commitments for significant unconsolidated vies—liquidity facilities and loan commitments 

the following table presents the notional amount of liquidity facilities and loan commitments that are classified as funding commitments in the vie tables above 



consolidated vies 

the company engages in onbalance sheet securitizations which are securitizations that do not qualify for sales treatment thus the assets remain on citi’s consolidated balance sheet and any proceeds received are recognized as secured liabilities in general the thirdparty investors in the obligations of consolidated vies have legal recourse only to the assets of the respective vies and do not have such recourse to the company except where citi has provided a guarantee to the investors or is the counterparty to certain derivative transactions involving the vie thus citigroup’s 

maximum legal exposure to loss related to consolidated vies is significantly less than the carrying value of the consolidated vie assets due to outstanding thirdparty financing 

intercompany assets and liabilities are excluded from citi’s consolidated balance sheet all vie assets are restricted from being sold or pledged as collateral the cash flows from these assets are the only source used to pay down the associated liabilities which are nonrecourse to citi’s general assets see the consolidated balance sheet for more information about these consolidated vie assets and liabilities 

significant interests in unconsolidated vies—balance sheet classification 

the following table presents the carrying amounts and classification of significant variable interests in unconsolidated vies 



credit card securitizations 

the company securitizes credit card receivables through trusts established to purchase the receivables citigroup transfers receivables into the trusts on a nonrecourse basis credit card securitizations are revolving securitizations as customers pay their credit card balances the cash proceeds are used to purchase new receivables and replenish the receivables in the trust 

substantially all of the company’s credit card securitization activity is through two trusts—citibank credit card master trust master trust and citibank omni trust omni trust with the substantial majority through the master trust these trusts are consolidated entities because as 

servicer citigroup has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the trusts citigroup holds a seller’s interest and certain securities issued by the trusts which could result in exposure to potentially significant losses or benefits from the trusts accordingly the transferred credit card receivables remain on citi’s consolidated balance sheet with no gain or loss recognized the debt issued by the trusts to third parties is included on citi’s consolidated balance sheet 

citi utilizes securitizations as one of the sources of funding for its business in north america  the following table reflects amounts related to the company’s securitized credit card receivables 

 

the following table summarizes selected cash flow information related to citigroup’s credit card securitizations 



managed loans 

after securitization of credit card receivables the company continues to maintain credit card customer account relationships and provides servicing for receivables transferred to the trusts as a result the company considers the securitized credit card receivables to be part of the business it manages as citigroup consolidates the credit card trusts all managed securitized card receivables are onbalance sheet 

funding liquidity facilities and subordinated interests 

as noted above citigroup securitizes credit card receivables through two securitization trusts—master trust and omni trust the liabilities of the trusts are included on the consolidated balance sheet excluding those retained by citigroup 

  

master trust liabilities at par value 

the master trust issues fixed and floatingrate term notes some of the term notes may be issued to multiseller commercial paper conduits the weighted average maturity of 

the thirdparty term notes issued by the master trust was 36 years as of december 31 2021 and 29 years as of december 31 2020 

 

omni trust liabilities at par value 

the omni trust issues fixed and floatingrate term notes some of which are purchased by multiseller commercial paper conduits the weighted average maturity of the thirdparty term notes issued by the omni trust was 16 years as of december 31 2021 and 11 years as of december 31 2020 

 

mortgage securitizations 

citigroup provides a wide range of mortgage loan products to a diverse customer base once originated the company often securitizes these loans through the use of vies these vies are funded through the issuance of trust certificates backed solely by the transferred assets these certificates have the same life as the transferred assets in addition to providing a source of liquidity and less expensive funding securitizing these assets also reduces citi’s credit exposure to the borrowers these mortgage loan securitizations are primarily nonrecourse thereby effectively transferring the risk of future credit losses to the purchasers of the securities issued by the trust 

citi’s us consumer mortgage business generally retains the servicing rights and in certain instances retains investment securities interestonly strips and residual interests in future cash flows from the trusts and also provides servicing for a limited number of icg securitizations citi’s icg business may hold investment securities pursuant to credit risk retention rules or in connection with secondary marketmaking activities 

the company securitizes mortgage loans generally through either a us governmentsponsored agency such as ginnie mae fannie mae or freddie mac us agencysponsored mortgages or private label nonagencysponsored 

mortgages securitization citi is not the primary beneficiary 

of its us agencysponsored mortgage securitization entities because citigroup does not have the power to direct the activities of the vies that most significantly impact the entities’ economic performance therefore citi does not consolidate these us agencysponsored mortgage securitization entities substantially all of the consumer loans sold or securitized through nonconsolidated trusts by citigroup are us prime residential mortgage loans retained interests in nonconsolidated agencysponsored mortgage securitization trusts are classified as trading account assets  except for msrs which are included in other assets on citigroup’s consolidated balance sheet 

citigroup does not consolidate certain nonagencysponsored mortgage securitization entities because citi is either not the servicer with the power to direct the significant activities of the entity or citi is the servicer but the servicing relationship is deemed to be a fiduciary relationship therefore citi is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the entity 

in certain instances the company has i the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities’ economic performance and ii the obligation to either absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could be potentially significant to its nonagencysponsored mortgage securitization entities and therefore is the primary beneficiary and thus consolidates the vie 

the following tables summarize selected cash flow information and retained interests related to citigroup mortgage securitizations 



note excludes resecuritization transactions 

1 the proceeds from new securitizations in 2019 include  02 billion related to personal loan securitizations 

for nonconsolidated mortgage securitization entities where the transfer of loans to the vie meets the conditions for sale accounting citi recognizes a gain or loss based on the difference between the carrying value of the transferred assets and the proceeds received generally cash but may be beneficial interests or servicing rights 

agency and nonagency securitization gains for the year ended december 31 2021 were  39 million and  4934 million respectively 

agency and nonagency securitization gains for the year ended december 31 2020 were  884 million and  1394 million respectively and  16 million and  734 million respectively for the year ended december 31 2019 

 

1 disclosure of nonagencysponsored mortgages as senior and subordinated interests is indicative of the interests’ position in the capital structure of the securitization 

2 senior interests in nonagencysponsored mortgages include  73 million related to personal loan securitizations at december 31 2021 

3 retained interests consist of level 2 and level 3 assets depending on the observability of significant inputs see note 24 to the consolidated financial statements for more information about fair value measurements 

key assumptions used in measuring the fair value of retained interests at the date of sale or securitization of mortgage receivables were as follows 





1 disclosure of nonagencysponsored mortgages as senior and subordinated interests is indicative of the interests’ position in the capital structure of the securitization 

2 anticipated net credit losses represent estimated loss severity associated with defaulted mortgage loans underlying the mortgage securitizations disclosed above anticipated net credit losses in this instance do not represent total credit losses incurred to date nor do they represent credit losses expected on retained interests in mortgage securitizations 

nm anticipated net credit losses are not meaningful due to us agency guarantees 

the interests retained by the company range from highly rated andor senior in the capital structure to unrated andor residual interests key assumptions used in measuring the fair value of retained interests in securitizations of mortgage receivables at period end were as follows 





1 disclosure of nonagencysponsored mortgages as senior and subordinated interests is indicative of the interests’ position in the capital structure of the securitization 

2 anticipated net credit losses represent estimated loss severity associated with defaulted mortgage loans underlying the mortgage securitizations disclosed above anticipated net credit losses in this instance do not represent total credit losses incurred to date nor do they represent credit losses expected on retained interests in mortgage securitizations 

nm anticipated net credit losses are not meaningful due to us agency guarantees 

the sensitivity of the fair value to adverse changes of 10 and 20 in each of the key assumptions is presented in the tables below the negative effect of each change is calculated independently holding all other assumptions constant because the key assumptions may not be independent the net effect of simultaneous adverse changes in the key assumptions may be less than the sum of the individual effects shown below 





nm anticipated net credit losses are not meaningful due to us agency guarantees 

the following table includes information about loan delinquencies and liquidation losses for assets held in nonconsolidated nonagencysponsored securitization entities 



1 securitized assets include  02 billion of personal loan securitizations as of december 31 2021 

mortgage servicing rights msrs 

in connection with the securitization of mortgage loans citi’s us consumer mortgage business generally retains the servicing rights which entitle the company to a future stream of cash flows based on the outstanding principal balances of the loans and the contractual servicing fee failure to service the loans in accordance with contractual requirements may lead to a termination of the servicing rights and the loss of future servicing fees 

these transactions create intangible assets referred to as msrs which are recorded at fair value on citi’s consolidated balance sheet the fair value of citi’s capitalized msrs was  404 million and  336 million at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively the msrs correspond to principal loan balances of  47 billion and  53 billion as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively 

the following table summarizes the changes in capitalized msrs 



1 represents changes due to customer payments and passage of time 

the fair value of the msrs is primarily affected by changes in prepayments of mortgages that result from shifts in mortgage interest rates specifically higher interest rates tend to lead to declining prepayments which causes the fair value of the msrs to increase in managing this risk citigroup economically hedges a significant portion of the value of its msrs through the use of interest rate derivative contracts forward purchase and sale commitments of mortgagebacked securities and purchased securities all classified as trading account assets  

the company receives fees during the course of servicing previously securitized mortgages the amounts of these fees were as follows 



in the consolidated statement of income these fees are primarily classified as commissions and fees  and changes in msr fair values are classified as other revenue  

resecuritizations 

the company engages in resecuritization transactions in which debt securities are transferred to a vie in exchange for new beneficial interests citi did not transfer nonagency private label securities to resecuritization entities during the 

years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 these securities are backed by either residential or commercial mortgages and are often structured on behalf of clients 

as of december 31 2021 and december 31 2020 citi held no retained interests in private label resecuritization transactions structured by citi 

the company also resecuritizes us governmentagencyguaranteed mortgagebacked agency securities during the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 citi transferred agency securities with a fair value of approximately  466 billion and  428 billion respectively to resecuritization entities 

as of december 31 2021 the fair value of citiretained interests in agency resecuritization transactions structured by citi totaled approximately  12 billion including  641 million related to resecuritization transactions executed in 2021 compared to  16 billion as of december 31 2020 including  916 million related to resecuritization transactions executed in 2020 which is recorded in trading account assets  the original fair values of agency resecuritization transactions in which citi holds a retained interest as of december 31 2021 and 2020 were approximately  784 billion and  836 billion respectively 

as of december 31 2021 and 2020 the company did not consolidate any private label or agency resecuritization entities 

citiadministered assetbacked commercial paper conduits 

the company is active in the assetbacked commercial paper conduit business as administrator of several multiseller commercial paper conduits and also as a service provider to singleseller and other commercial paper conduits sponsored by third parties 

citi’s multiseller commercial paper conduits are designed to provide the company’s clients access to lowcost funding in the commercial paper markets the conduits purchase assets from or provide financing facilities to clients and are funded by issuing commercial paper to thirdparty investors the conduits generally do not purchase assets originated by citi the funding of the conduits is facilitated by the liquidity support and credit enhancements provided by the company 

as administrator to citi’s conduits the company is generally responsible for selecting and structuring assets purchased or financed by the conduits making decisions regarding the funding of the conduits including determining the tenor and other features of the commercial paper issued monitoring the quality and performance of the conduits’ assets and facilitating the operations and cash flows of the conduits in return the company earns structuring fees from customers for individual transactions and earns an administration fee from the conduit which is equal to the income from the client program and liquidity fees of the conduit after payment of conduit expenses this administration fee is fairly stable since most risks and rewards of the underlying assets are passed back to the clients once the asset pricing is negotiated most ongoing income costs and fees are relatively stable as a percentage of the conduit’s size 

the conduits administered by citi do not generally invest in liquid securities that are formally rated by third parties the assets are privately negotiated and structured transactions that are generally designed to be held by the conduit rather than actively traded and sold the yield earned by the conduit on each asset is generally tied to the rate on the commercial paper issued by the conduit thus passing interest rate risk to the client each asset purchased by the conduit is structured with transactionspecific credit enhancement features provided by the thirdparty client seller including overcollateralization cash and excess spread collateral accounts direct recourse or thirdparty guarantees these credit enhancements are sized with the objective of approximating a credit rating of a or above based on citi’s internal risk ratings at december 31 2021 and 2020 the commercial paper conduits administered by citi had approximately  140 billion and  167 billion of purchased assets outstanding respectively and had incremental funding commitments with clients of approximately  183 billion and  171 billion respectively 

substantially all of the funding of the conduits is in the form of shortterm commercial paper at december 31 2021 and 2020 the weighted average remaining lives of the commercial paper issued by the conduits were approximately 70 and 54 days respectively 

the primary credit enhancement provided to the conduit investors is in the form of transactionspecific credit enhancements described above each asset purchased by the conduit is structured with transactionspecific credit enhancement features provided by the thirdparty client seller including overcollateralization cash and excess spread collateral accounts direct recourse or thirdparty guarantees these credit enhancements are sized with the objective of approximating a credit rating of a or above based on citi’s internal risk ratings in addition to the transactionspecific credit enhancements the conduits other than the government guaranteed loan conduit have obtained letters of credit from the company which equal at least 8  to 10  of the conduit’s assets with a minimum of  200 million the letters of credit provided by the company to the conduits total approximately  13 billion as of december 31 2021 and  15 billion as of december 31 2020 the net result across multiseller conduits administered by the company is that in the event that defaulted assets exceed the transactionspecific credit enhancements described above any losses in each conduit are allocated first to the company and then to the commercial paper investors 

citigroup also provides the conduits with two forms of liquidity agreements that are used to provide funding to the conduits in the event of a market disruption among other events each asset of the conduits is supported by a transactionspecific liquidity facility in the form of an asset purchase agreement apa under the apa the company has generally agreed to purchase nondefaulted eligible receivables from the conduit at par the apa is not designed to provide credit support to the conduit as it generally does not permit the purchase of defaulted or impaired assets any funding under the apa will likely subject the underlying conduit clients to increased interest costs in addition the company provides the conduits with programwide liquidity in the form of shortterm lending commitments under these 

commitments the company has agreed to lend to the conduits in the event of a shortterm disruption in the commercial paper market subject to specified conditions the company receives fees for providing both types of liquidity agreements and considers these fees to be on fair market terms 

finally citi is one of several named dealers in the commercial paper issued by the conduits and earns a marketbased fee for providing such services along with thirdparty dealers the company makes a market in the commercial paper and may from time to time fund commercial paper pending sale to a third party on specific dates with less liquidity in the market the company may hold in inventory commercial paper issued by conduits administered by the company as well as conduits administered by third parties separately in the normal course of business citi purchases commercial paper including commercial paper issued by citigroups conduits at december 31 2021 and 2020 the company owned  49 billion and  66 billion respectively of the commercial paper issued by its administered conduits the company’s investments were not driven by market illiquidity and the company is not obligated under any agreement to purchase the commercial paper issued by the conduits 

the assetbacked commercial paper conduits are consolidated by citi the company has determined that through its roles as administrator and liquidity provider it has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities’ economic performance these powers include its ability to structure and approve the assets purchased by the conduits its ongoing surveillance and credit mitigation activities its ability to sell or repurchase assets out of the conduits and its liability management in addition as a result of all the company’s involvement described above it was concluded that citi has an economic interest that could potentially be significant however the assets and liabilities of the conduits are separate and apart from those of citigroup no assets of any conduit are available to satisfy the creditors of citigroup or any of its other subsidiaries 

collateralized loan obligations clos 

a collateralized loan obligation clo is a vie that purchases a portfolio of assets consisting primarily of noninvestment grade corporate loans clos issue multiple tranches of debt and equity to investors to fund the asset purchases and pay upfront expenses associated with forming the clo a thirdparty asset manager is contracted by the clo to purchase the underlying assets from the open market and monitor the credit risk associated with those assets over the term of a clo the asset manager directs purchases and sales of assets in a manner consistent with the clo’s asset management agreement and indenture in general the clo asset manager will have the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the economic performance of the clo investors in a clo through their ownership of debt andor equity in it can also direct certain activities of the clo including removing its asset manager under limited circumstances optionally redeeming the notes voting on amendments to the clo’s operating documents and other activities a clo has a finite life typically 12 years 

citi serves as a structuring and placement agent with respect to the clos typically the debt and equity of the 

clos are sold to thirdparty investors on occasion certain citi entities may purchase some portion of a clo’s liabilities for investment purposes in addition citi may purchase typically in the secondary market certain securities issued by the clos to support its marketmaking activities 

the company generally does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the clos as this power is generally held by a thirdparty asset manager of the clo as such those clos are not consolidated

assetbased financing 

the company provides loans and other forms of financing to vies that hold assets those loans are subject to the same credit approvals as all other loans originated or purchased by the company financings in the form of debt securities or derivatives are in most circumstances reported in trading account assets and accounted for at fair value through earnings the company generally does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact these vies’ economic performance thus it does not consolidate them 

  the primary types of citi’s assetbased financings total assets of the unconsolidated vies with significant involvement and citi’s maximum exposure to loss are shown below for citi to realize the maximum loss the vie borrower would have to default with no recovery from the assets held by the vie 

 

 

municipal securities tender option bond tob trusts 

municipal tob trusts may hold fixed or floatingrate taxable or taxexempt securities issued by state and local governments and municipalities tob trusts are typically structured as singleissuer entities whose assets are purchased from either the company or from other investors in the municipal securities market tob trusts finance the purchase of their municipal assets by issuing two classes of certificates longdated floating rate certificates “floaters” that are putable pursuant to a liquidity facility and residual interest certificates “residuals” the floaters are purchased by thirdparty investors typically taxexempt money market funds the residuals are purchased by the original owner of the municipal securities that are being financed 

from citigroup’s perspective there are two types of tob trusts customer and noncustomer customer tob trusts are those trusts utilized by customers of the company to finance their securities generally municipal securities the residuals issued by these trusts are purchased by the customer being financed noncustomer tob trusts are generally used by the company to finance its own municipal securities investments the residuals issued by noncustomer tob trusts are purchased by the company 

with respect to both customer and noncustomer tob trusts citi may provide remarketing agent services if floaters are optionally tendered and the company in its role as remarketing agent is unable to find a new investor to purchase the optionally tendered floaters within a specified period of time citigroup may but is not obligated to purchase the tendered floaters into its own inventory the level of the company’s inventory of such floaters fluctuates 

for certain customer tob trusts citi may also serve as a voluntary advance provider in this capacity the company may but is not obligated to make loan advances to customer tob trusts to purchase optionally tendered floaters that have not otherwise been successfully remarketed to new investors such loans are secured by pledged floaters as of december 31 2021 citi had no outstanding voluntary advances to customer tob trusts 

for certain noncustomer trusts the company also provides credit enhancement at december 31 2021 and 2020 none of the municipal bonds owned by noncustomer tob trusts were subject to a credit guarantee provided by the company 

citigroup also provides liquidity services to many customer and noncustomer trusts if a trust is unwound early due to an event other than a credit event on the underlying municipal bonds the underlying municipal bonds are sold out of the trust and bond sale proceeds are used to redeem the outstanding trust certificates if this results in a shortfall between the bond sale proceeds and the redemption price of the tendered floaters the company pursuant to the liquidity agreement would be obligated to make a payment to the trust to satisfy that shortfall for certain customer tob trusts citigroup has also executed a reimbursement agreement with the holder of the residual pursuant to which the residual holder is obligated to reimburse the company for any payment the company makes under the liquidity arrangement these reimbursement agreements may be subject to daily margining based on changes in the market value of the underlying municipal bonds in cases where a third party provides liquidity to a noncustomer tob trust a similar reimbursement arrangement may be executed whereby the company or a consolidated subsidiary of the company as residual holder would absorb any losses incurred by the liquidity provider 

for certain other noncustomer tob trusts citi serves as tender option provider the tender option provider arrangement allows floater holders to put their interests directly to the company at any time subject to the requisite notice period requirements at a price of par 

at december 31 2021 and 2020 liquidity agreements provided with respect to customer tob trusts totaled  15 billion and  16 billion respectively of which  06 billion and  08 billion respectively were offset by reimbursement agreements for the remaining exposure related to tob transactions where the residual owned by the customer was at least 25  of the bond value at the inception of the transaction no reimbursement agreement was executed 

citi considers both customer and noncustomer tob trusts to be vies customer tob trusts are not consolidated by the company as the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the trust’s economic performance rests with the customer residual holder which may unilaterally cause the sale of the trust’s bonds 

noncustomer tob trusts generally are consolidated because the company holds the residual interest and thus has the unilateral power to cause the sale of the trust’s bonds 

the company also provides other liquidity agreements or letters of credit to customersponsored municipal investment funds which are not variable interest entities and municipalityrelated issuers that totaled  2 billion as of december 31 2021 and  36 billion as of december 31 2020 these liquidity agreements and letters of credit are offset by reimbursement agreements with various termout provisions 

municipal investments 

municipal investment transactions include debt and equity interests in partnerships that finance the construction and rehabilitation of lowincome housing facilitate lending in new or underserved markets or finance the construction or operation of renewable municipal energy facilities citi generally invests in these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits and 

grants earned from the investments made by the partnership the company may also provide construction loans or permanent loans for the development or operation of real estate properties held by partnerships these entities are generally considered vies the power to direct the activities of these entities is typically held by the general partner accordingly these entities are not consolidated by citigroup 

client intermediation 

client intermediation transactions represent a range of transactions designed to provide investors with specified returns based on the returns of an underlying security referenced asset or index these transactions include creditlinked notes and equitylinked notes in these transactions the vie typically obtains exposure to the underlying security referenced asset or index through a derivative instrument such as a totalreturn swap or a creditdefault swap in turn the vie issues notes to investors that pay a return based on the specified underlying security referenced asset or index the vie invests the proceeds in a financial asset or a guaranteed insurance contract that serves as collateral for the derivative contract over the term of the transaction the company’s involvement in these transactions includes being the counterparty to the vie’s derivative instruments and investing in a portion of the notes issued by the vie in certain transactions the investor’s maximum risk of loss is limited and the company absorbs risk of loss above a specified level citi does not have the power to direct the activities of the vies that most significantly impact their economic performance and thus it does not consolidate them 

citi’s maximum risk of loss in these transactions is defined as the amount invested in notes issued by the vie and the notional amount of any risk of loss absorbed by citi through a separate instrument issued by the vie the derivative instrument held by the company may generate a receivable from the vie eg where the company purchases credit protection from the vie in connection with the vie’s issuance of a creditlinked note which is collateralized by the assets owned by the vie these derivative instruments are not considered variable interests and any associated receivables are not included in the calculation of maximum exposure to the vie 

investment funds 

the company is the investment manager for certain investment funds and retirement funds that invest in various asset classes including private equity hedge funds real estate fixed income and infrastructure citigroup earns a management fee which is a percentage of capital under management and may earn performance fees in addition for some of these funds the company has an ownership interest in the investment funds citi has also established a number of investment funds as opportunities for qualified colleagues to invest in private equity investments the company acts as investment manager for these funds and may provide colleagues with financing on both recourse and nonrecourse bases for a portion of the colleagues’ investment commitments 

22 derivatives 

in the ordinary course of business citigroup enters into various types of derivative transactions which include 

• futures and forward contracts  which are commitments to buy or sell at a future date a financial instrument commodity or currency at a contracted price that may be settled in cash or through delivery of an item readily convertible to cash 

• swap contracts  which are commitments to settle in cash at a future date or dates that may range from a few days to a number of years based on differentials between specified indices or financial instruments as applied to a notional principal amount 

• option contracts  which give the purchaser for a premium the right but not the obligation to buy or sell within a specified time a financial instrument commodity or currency at a contracted price that may also be settled in cash based on differentials between specified indices or prices 

swaps forwards and some option contracts are overthecounter otc derivatives that are bilaterally negotiated with counterparties and settled with those counterparties except for swap contracts that are novated and cleared through central counterparties ccps futures contracts and other option contracts are standardized contracts that are traded on an exchange with a ccp as the counterparty from the inception of the transaction citigroup enters into derivative contracts relating to interest rate foreign currency commodity and other marketcredit risks for the following reasons 

• trading purposes  citigroup trades derivatives as an active market maker citigroup offers its customers derivatives in connection with their risk management actions to transfer modify or reduce their interest rate foreign exchange and other marketcredit risks or for their own trading purposes citigroup also manages its derivative risk positions through offsetting trade activities controls focused on price verification and daily reporting of positions to senior managers 

• hedging  citigroup uses derivatives in connection with its own risk management activities to hedge certain risks or reposition the risk profile of the company hedging may be accomplished by applying hedge accounting in accordance with asc 815 derivatives and hedging  or by an economic hedge for example citigroup issues fixedrate longterm debt and then enters into a receivefixed payvariablerate interest rate swap with the same tenor and notional amount to synthetically convert the interest payments to a net variablerate basis this strategy is the most common form of an interest rate hedge as it minimizes net interest cost in certain yield curve environments derivatives are also used to manage market risks inherent in specific groups of onbalance sheet assets and liabilities including afs securities commodities and borrowings as well as other interestsensitive assets and liabilities in addition foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge nonusdollar 

denominated debt foreign currencydenominated afs securities and net investment exposures 

derivatives may expose citigroup to market credit or liquidity risks in excess of the amounts recorded on the consolidated balance sheet market risk on a derivative product is the exposure created by potential fluctuations in interest rates market prices foreign exchange rates and other factors and is a function of the type of product the volume of transactions the tenor and terms of the agreement and the underlying volatility credit risk is the exposure to loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to satisfy a derivative liability where the value of any collateral held by citi is not adequate to cover such losses the recognition in earnings of unrealized gains on derivative transactions is subject to management’s assessment of the probability of counterparty default liquidity risk is the potential exposure that arises when the size of a derivative position may affect the ability to monetize the position in a reasonable period of time and at a reasonable cost in periods of high volatility and financial stress 

derivative transactions are customarily documented under industry standard master netting agreements which provide that following an event of default the nondefaulting party may promptly terminate all transactions between the parties and determine the net amount due to be paid to or by the defaulting party events of default include i failure to make a payment on a derivative transaction that remains uncured following applicable notice and grace periods ii breach of agreement that remains uncured after applicable notice and grace periods iii breach of a representation iv cross default either to thirdparty debt or to other derivative transactions entered into between the parties or in some cases their affiliates v the occurrence of a merger or consolidation that results in the creditworthiness of a party becoming materially weaker and vi the cessation or repudiation of any applicable guarantee or other credit support document obligations under master netting agreements are often secured by collateral posted under an industry standard credit support annex to the master netting agreement an event of default may also occur under a credit support annex if a party fails to make a collateral delivery that remains uncured following applicable notice and grace periods 

the netting and collateral rights incorporated in the master netting agreements are considered to be legally enforceable if a supportive legal opinion has been obtained from counsel of recognized standing that provides i the requisite level of certainty regarding enforceability and ii that the exercise of rights by the nondefaulting party to terminate and closeout transactions on a net basis under these agreements will not be stayed or avoided under applicable law upon an event of default including bankruptcy insolvency or similar proceeding 

a legal opinion may not be sought for certain jurisdictions where local law is silent or unclear as to the enforceability of such rights or where adverse case law or conflicting regulation may cast doubt on the enforceability of such rights in some jurisdictions and for some counterparty types the insolvency law may not provide the requisite level of certainty for 

example this may be the case for certain sovereigns municipalities central banks and us pension plans 

exposure to credit risk on derivatives is affected by market volatility which may impair the ability of counterparties to satisfy their obligations to the company credit limits are established and closely monitored for customers engaged in derivatives transactions citi considers the level of legal certainty regarding enforceability of its offsetting rights under master netting agreements and credit support annexes to be an important factor in its risk management process specifically citi generally transacts much lower volumes of derivatives under master netting agreements where citi does not have the requisite level of legal certainty regarding enforceability because such derivatives consume greater amounts of single counterparty credit limits than those executed under enforceable master netting agreements 

cash collateral and security collateral in the form of g10 government debt securities are often posted by a party to a master netting agreement to secure the net open exposure of the other party the receiving party is free to comminglerehypothecate such collateral in the ordinary course of its business nonstandard collateral such as corporate bonds municipal bonds us agency securities andor mbs may also be pledged as collateral for derivative transactions security collateral posted to open and maintain a master netting agreement with a counterparty in the form of cash andor securities may from time to time be segregated in an account at a thirdparty custodian pursuant to a triparty account control agreement 

information pertaining to citigroup’s derivatives activities based on notional amounts is presented in the table below derivative notional amounts are reference amounts from which contractual payments are derived and do not represent a complete measure of citi’s exposure to derivative transactions citi’s derivative exposure arises primarily from market fluctuations ie market risk counterparty failure ie credit risk andor periods of high volatility or financial stress ie liquidity risk as well as any market valuation adjustments that may be required on the transactions moreover notional amounts do not reflect the netting of offsetting trades for example if citi enters into a receivefixed interest rate swap with 100 million notional and offsets this risk with an identical but opposite payfixed position with a different counterparty 200 million in derivative notionals is reported although these offsetting positions may result in de minimis overall market risk 

in addition aggregate derivative notional amounts can fluctuate from period to period in the normal course of business based on citi’s market share levels of client activity and other factors all derivatives are recorded in trading account assetstrading account liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 

derivative notionals 



1 credit derivatives are arrangements designed to allow one party protection purchaser to transfer the credit risk of a “reference asset” to another party protection seller these arrangements allow a protection seller to assume the credit risk associated with the reference asset without directly purchasing that asset the company enters into credit derivative positions for purposes such as risk management yield enhancement reduction of credit concentrations and diversification of overall risk 

the following tables present the gross and net fair values of the company’s derivative transactions and the related offsetting amounts as of december 31 2021 and 2020 gross positive fair values are offset against gross negative fair values by counterparty pursuant to enforceable master netting agreements under asc 8151045 payables and receivables in respect of cash collateral received from or paid to a given counterparty pursuant to a credit support annex are included in the offsetting amount if a legal opinion supporting the enforceability of netting and collateral rights has been obtained gaap does not permit similar offsetting for security collateral 

in addition the following tables reflect rules adopted by clearing organizations that require or allow entities to treat certain derivative assets liabilities and the related variation margin as settlement of the related derivative fair values for legal and accounting purposes as opposed to presenting gross derivative assets and liabilities that are subject to collateral whereby the counterparties would also record a related collateral payable or receivable as a result the tables reflect a reduction of approximately  340 billion and  280 billion as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively of derivative assets and derivative liabilities that previously would have been reported on a gross basis but are now legally settled and not subject to collateral the tables also present amounts that are not permitted to be offset such as security collateral or cash collateral posted at thirdparty custodians but which would be eligible for offsetting to the extent that an event of default has occurred and a legal opinion supporting enforceability of the netting and collateral rights has been obtained

for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 amounts recognized in principal transactions in the consolidated statement of income include certain derivatives not designated in a qualifying hedging relationship citigroup presents this disclosure by business classification showing derivative gains and losses related to its trading activities together with gains and losses related to nonderivative instruments within the same trading portfolios as this represents how these portfolios are risk managed see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

the amounts recognized in other revenue in the consolidated statement of income related to derivatives not designated in a qualifying hedging relationship are shown below the table below does not include any offsetting gains losses on the economically hedged items to the extent that such amounts are also recorded in other revenue  

 

accounting for derivative hedging 

citigroup accounts for its hedging activities in accordance with asc 815 derivatives and hedging  as a general rule hedge accounting is permitted where the company is exposed to a particular risk such as interest rate or foreign exchange risk that causes changes in the fair value of an asset or liability or variability in the expected future cash flows of an existing asset liability or a forecasted transaction that may affect earnings 

derivative contracts hedging the risks associated with changes in fair value are referred to as fair value hedges while contracts hedging the variability of expected future cash flows are cash flow hedges hedges that utilize derivatives or debt instruments to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with equity investments in nonusdollarfunctionalcurrency foreign subsidiaries net investment in a foreign operation are net investment hedges 

to qualify as an accounting hedge under the hedge accounting rules versus an economic hedge where hedge accounting is not applied a hedging relationship must be highly effective in offsetting the risk designated as being 

hedged the hedging relationship must be formally documented at inception detailing the particular risk management objective and strategy for the hedge this includes the item and risks being hedged the hedging instrument being used and how effectiveness will be assessed the effectiveness of these hedging relationships is evaluated at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis both on a retrospective and prospective basis typically using quantitative measures of correlation with hedge ineffectiveness measured and recorded in current earnings hedge effectiveness assessment methodologies are performed in a similar manner for similar hedges and are used 

consistently throughout the hedging relationships the assessment of effectiveness may exclude changes in the value of the hedged item that are unrelated to the risks being hedged and the changes in fair value of the derivative associated with time value citi excludes changes in the crosscurrency basis associated with crosscurrency swaps from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and records it in other comprehensive income  

discontinued hedge accounting 

a hedging instrument must be highly effective in accomplishing the hedge objective of offsetting either changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item for the risk being hedged management may voluntarily dedesignate an accounting hedge at any time but if a hedging relationship is not highly effective it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting and must be dedesignated subsequent changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognized in other revenue or principal transactions  similar to trading derivatives with no offset recorded related to the hedged item 

for fair value hedges any changes in the fair value of the hedged item remain as part of the basis of the asset or liability and are ultimately realized as an element of the yield on the item for cash flow hedges changes in fair value of the enduser derivative remain in accumulated other comprehensive income loss aoci and are included in the earnings of future periods when the forecasted hedged cash flows impact earnings however if it becomes probable that some or all of the hedged forecasted transactions will not occur any amounts that remain in aoci related to these transactions must be immediately reflected in other revenue  

the foregoing criteria are applied on a decentralized basis consistent with the level at which market risk is managed but are subject to various limits and controls the underlying asset liability or forecasted transaction may be an individual item or a portfolio of similar items 

fair value hedges 

hedging of benchmark interest rate risk 

citigroup’s fair value hedges are primarily hedges of fixedrate longterm debt or assets such as availableforsale debt securities or loans 

for qualifying fair value hedges of interest rate risk the changes in the fair value of the derivative and the change in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are presented within interest revenue or interest expense based on whether the hedged item is an asset or a liability 

citigroup has executed a lastoflayer hedge which permits an entity to hedge the interest rate risk of a stated portion of a closed portfolio of prepayable financial assets that are expected to remain outstanding for the designated tenor of the hedge in accordance with asc 815 an entity may exclude prepayment risk when measuring the change in fair value of the hedged item attributable to interest rate risk under the lastoflayer approach similar to other fair value hedges where the hedged item is an asset the fair value of the hedged item attributable to interest rate risk will be presented in interest revenue along with the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument 

hedging of foreign exchange risk 

citigroup hedges the change in fair value attributable to foreign exchange rate movements in availableforsale debt securities and longterm debt that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity holding the securities or issuing the debt the hedging instrument is generally a forward foreign exchange contract or a crosscurrency swap contract citigroup considers the premium associated with forward contracts ie the differential between the spot and contractual forward rates as the cost of hedging this amount is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and is generally reflected directly in earnings over the life of the hedge citi also excludes changes in crosscurrency basis associated with crosscurrency swaps from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and records it in other comprehensive income 

hedging of commodity price risk 

citigroup hedges the change in fair value attributable to spot price movements in physical commodities inventories the hedging instrument is a futures contract to sell the underlying commodity in this hedge the change in the value of the hedged inventory is reflected in earnings which offsets the change in the fair value of the futures contract that is also reflected in earnings although the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument recorded in earnings includes changes in forward rates citigroup excludes the differential between the spot and the contractual forward rates under the futures contract from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and it is generally reflected directly in earnings over the life of the hedge citi also excludes changes in forward rates from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and records it in other comprehensive income  

the following table summarizes the gains losses on the company’s fair value hedges 



1 gain loss amounts for interest rate risk hedges are included in interest revenueinterest expense the accrued interest income on fair value hedges is recorded in net interest income and is excluded from this table 

2 amounts relate to the premium associated with forward contracts differential between spot and contractual forward rates that are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are generally reflected directly in earnings amounts related to crosscurrency basis which are recognized in aoci  are not reflected in the table above the amount of crosscurrency basis included in aoci was  2 million and  23  million for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively 

cumulative basis adjustment 

upon electing to apply asc 815 fair value hedge accounting the carrying value of the hedged item is adjusted to reflect the cumulative changes in the hedged risk this cumulative hedge basis adjustment becomes part of the carrying value of the hedged item until the hedged item is derecognized from the balance sheet the table below presents the carrying amount of citi’s hedged assets and liabilities under qualifying fair value hedges at december 31 2021 and 2020 along with the cumulative hedge basis adjustments included in the carrying value of those hedged assets and liabilities that would reverse through earnings in future periods 



1 these amounts include a cumulative basis adjustment of  24 million for active hedges and  92  million for dedesignated hedges as of december 31 2021 related to certain prepayable financial assets previously designated as the hedged item in a fair value hedge using the lastoflayer approach the company designated approximately  6 billion as the hedged amount from a closed portfolio of prepayable financial assets with a carrying value of  25 billion as of december 31 2021 in a lastoflayer hedging relationship 

2 these amounts include a cumulative basis adjustment of  18  million for active hedges and  62 million for dedesignated hedges as of december 31 2020 related to certain prepayable financial assets previously designated as the hedged item in a fair value hedge using the lastoflayer approach the company designated approximately  3 billion as the hedged amount from a closed portfolio of prepayable financial assets with a carrying value of  19 billion as of december 31 2020 in a lastoflayer hedging relationship 

3 carrying amount represents the amortized cost 

cash flow hedges 

citigroup hedges the variability of forecasted cash flows due to changes in contractually specified interest rates associated with floatingrate assetsliabilities and other forecasted transactions variable cash flows from those liabilities are synthetically converted to fixedrate cash flows by entering into receivevariable payfixed interest rate swaps and receivevariable payfixed forwardstarting interest rate swaps variable cash flows associated with certain assets are synthetically converted to fixedrate cash flows by entering into receivefixed payvariable interest rate swaps these cash flow hedging relationships use either regression analysis or dollaroffset ratio analysis to assess whether the hedging relationships are highly effective at inception and on an ongoing basis 

citigroup hedges the variability from changes in a contractually specified rate and recognizes the entire change in fair value of the cash flow hedging instruments in aoci  the full change in the value of the hedging instrument is required to be recognized in aoci  and then recognized in earnings in the same period that the cash flows impact earnings the pretax change in aoci from cash flow hedges is presented below 

 

1 all amounts reclassified into earnings for interest rate contracts are included in interest revenueinterest expense net interest income  for all other hedges the amounts reclassified to earnings are included primarily in other revenue and net interest income in the consolidated statement of income 

for cash flow hedges the entire change in the fair value of the hedging derivative is recognized in aoci and then reclassified to earnings in the same period that the forecasted hedged cash flows impact earnings the net gain loss associated with cash flow hedges expected to be reclassified from aoci within 12 months of december 31 2021 is approximately  614 million the maximum length of time over which forecasted cash flows are hedged is 10 years 

the aftertax impact of cash flow hedges on aoci is shown in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements 

net investment hedges 

consistent with asc 83020 foreign currency matters—foreign currency transactions  asc 815 allows the hedging of the foreign currency risk of a net investment in a foreign operation citigroup uses foreign currency forwards crosscurrency swaps options and foreign currencydenominated debt instruments to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with citigroup’s equity investments in several nonusdollarfunctionalcurrency foreign subsidiaries citigroup records the change in the carrying amount of these investments in foreign currency translation adjustment within aoci  simultaneously the effective portion of the hedge of this exposure is also recorded in foreign currency translation adjustment and any ineffective portion is immediately recorded in earnings 

for derivatives designated as net investment hedges citigroup follows the forwardrate method outlined in asc 8153535 according to that method all changes in fair value including changes related to the forwardrate component of the foreign currency forward contracts and the time value of foreign currency options are recorded in foreign currency translation adjustment within aoci  

for foreign currencydenominated debt instruments that are designated as hedges of net investments the translation gain or loss that is recorded in foreign currency translation adjustment is based on the spot exchange rate between the functional currency of the respective subsidiary and the us dollar which is the functional currency of citigroup to the extent that the notional amount of the hedging instrument exactly matches the hedged net investment and the underlying exchange rate of the derivative hedging instrument relates to the exchange rate between the functional currency of the net investment and citigroup’s functional currency or in the case of a nonderivative debt instrument such instrument is denominated in the functional currency of the net investment no ineffectiveness is recorded in earnings 

the pretax gain loss recorded in foreign currency translation adjustment within aoci  related to net investment hedges was  855 million  600  million and  569  million for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively 

economic hedges 

citigroup often uses economic hedges when hedge accounting would be too complex or operationally burdensome enduser derivatives that are economic hedges are carried at fair value with changes in value included in either principal transactions or other revenue  

for assetliability management hedging fixedrate longterm debt is recorded at amortized cost under gaap 

for other hedges that either do not meet the asc 815 hedging criteria or for which management decides not to apply asc 815 hedge accounting the derivative is recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with the associated changes in fair value recorded in earnings while the debt continues to be carried at amortized cost therefore current earnings are affected by the interest rate shifts and other factors that cause a change in the swap’s value but for which no offsetting change in value is recorded on the debt 

citigroup may alternatively elect to account for the debt at fair value under the fair value option once the irrevocable election is made upon issuance of the debt the full change in fair value of the debt is reported in earnings the changes in fair value of the related interest rate swap are also reflected in earnings which provides a natural offset to the debt’s fair value change to the extent that the two amounts differ because the full change in the fair value of the debt includes risks not offset by the interest rate swap the difference is automatically captured in current earnings 

additional economic hedges include hedges of the credit risk component of commercial loans and loan commitments citigroup periodically evaluates its hedging strategies in other areas and may designate either an accounting hedge or an economic hedge after considering the relative costs and benefits economic hedges are also employed when the hedged item itself is marked to market through current earnings such as hedges of commitments to originate one to fourfamily mortgage loans to be hfs and msrs 

credit derivatives 

citi is a market maker and trades a range of credit derivatives through these contracts citi either purchases or writes protection on either a single name or a portfolio of reference credits citi also uses credit derivatives to help mitigate credit risk in its corporate and consumer loan portfolios and other cash positions and to facilitate client transactions 

citi monitors its counterparty credit risk in credit derivative contracts as of december 31 2021 and 2020 approximately 99  and 97  respectively of the gross receivables are from counterparties with which citi maintains master netting agreements collateral agreements or settles daily a majority of citi’s top 15 counterparties by receivable balance owed to citi are central clearing houses banks financial institutions or other dealers contracts with these counterparties do not include ratingsbased termination events however counterparty ratings downgrades may have an incremental effect by lowering the threshold at which citi may call for additional collateral 

the range of credit derivatives entered into includes credit default swaps total return swaps credit options and creditlinked notes 

a credit default swap is a contract in which for a fee a protection seller agrees to reimburse a protection buyer for any losses that occur due to a predefined credit event on a reference entity these credit events are defined by the terms of the derivative contract and the reference entity and are generally limited to the market standard of failure to pay on indebtedness and bankruptcy of the reference entity and in a more limited range of transactions debt restructuring credit derivative transactions that reference emerging market entities also typically include additional credit events to cover the acceleration of indebtedness and the risk of repudiation or a payment moratorium in certain transactions protection may be provided on a portfolio of reference entities or assetbacked securities if there is no credit event as defined by the specific derivative contract then the protection seller makes no payments to the protection buyer and receives only the contractually specified fee however if a credit event occurs as defined in the specific derivative contract sold the 

protection seller will be required to make a payment to the protection buyer under certain contracts the seller of protection may not be required to make a payment until a specified amount of losses has occurred with respect to the portfolio andor may only be required to pay for losses up to a specified amount 

a total return swap typically transfers the total economic performance of a reference asset which includes all associated cash flows as well as capital appreciation or depreciation the protection buyer receives a floating rate of interest and any depreciation on the reference asset from the protection seller and in return the protection seller receives the cash flows associated with the reference asset plus any appreciation thus according to the total return swap agreement the protection seller will be obligated to make a payment any time the floating interest rate payment plus any depreciation of the reference asset exceeds the cash flows associated with the underlying asset a total return swap may terminate upon a default of the reference asset or a credit event with respect to the reference entity subject to the provisions of the related total return swap agreement between the protection seller and the protection buyer 

a credit option is a credit derivative that allows investors to trade or hedge changes in the credit quality of a reference entity for example in a credit spread option the option writer assumes the obligation to purchase or sell credit protection on the reference entity at a specified “strike” spread level the option purchaser buys the right to sell credit default protection on the reference entity to or purchase it from the option writer at the strike spread level the payments on credit spread options depend either on a particular credit spread or the price of the underlying creditsensitive asset or other reference entity the options usually terminate if a credit event occurs with respect to the underlying reference entity 

a creditlinked note is a form of credit derivative structured as a debt security with an embedded credit default swap the purchaser of the note effectively provides credit protection to the issuer by agreeing to receive a return that could be negatively affected by credit events on the underlying reference entity if the reference entity defaults the note may be cash settled or physically settled by delivery of a debt security of the reference entity thus the maximum amount of the note purchaser’s exposure is the amount paid for the creditlinked note 

the following tables summarize the key characteristics of citi’s credit derivatives portfolio by counterparty and derivative form 



1 the fair value amount receivable is composed of  3705 million under protection purchased and  6513 million under protection sold 

2 the fair value amount payable is composed of  7354 million under protection purchased and  3661 million under protection sold 



1 the fair value amount receivable is composed of  3514 million under protection purchased and  6275 million under protection sold 

2 the fair value amount payable is composed of  7037 million under protection purchased and  3092 million under protection sold 

fair values included in the above tables are prior to application of any netting agreements and cash collateral for notional amounts citi generally has a mismatch between the total notional amounts of protection purchased and sold and it may hold the reference assets directly rather than entering into offsetting credit derivative contracts as and when desired the open risk exposures from credit derivative contracts are largely matched after certain cash positions in reference assets are considered and after notional amounts are adjusted either to a durationbased equivalent basis or to reflect the level of subordination in tranched structures the ratings of the credit derivatives portfolio presented in the tables and used to evaluate paymentperformance risk are based on the assigned internal or external ratings of the reference asset or entity where external ratings are used investmentgrade ratings are considered to be “baabbb” and above while anything below is considered noninvestment grade citi’s internal ratings are in line with the related external rating system 

citigroup evaluates the paymentperformance risk of the credit derivatives for which it stands as a protection seller based on the credit rating assigned to the underlying reference credit credit derivatives written on an underlying noninvestmentgrade reference entity represent greater payment risk to the company the noninvestmentgrade category in the table above also includes credit derivatives where the underlying reference entity has been downgraded subsequent to the inception of the derivative 

the maximum potential amount of future payments under credit derivative contracts presented in the table above is based on the notional value of the derivatives the company believes that the notional amount for credit protection sold is not representative of the actual loss exposure based on historical experience this amount has not been reduced by the value of the reference assets and the related cash flows in accordance with most credit derivative contracts should a credit event occur the company usually is liable for the difference between the protection sold and the value of the reference assets furthermore the notional amount for credit protection sold has not been reduced for any cash collateral paid to a given counterparty as such payments would be calculated after netting all derivative exposures including any credit derivatives with that counterparty in accordance with a related master netting agreement due to such netting processes determining the amount of collateral that corresponds to credit derivative exposures alone is not possible the company actively monitors open creditrisk exposures and manages this exposure by using a variety of strategies including purchased credit derivatives cash collateral or direct holdings of the referenced assets this risk mitigation activity is not captured in the table above 

credit riskrelated contingent features in derivatives 

certain derivative instruments contain provisions that require the company to either post additional collateral or immediately settle any outstanding liability balances upon the occurrence of a specified event related to the credit risk of the company these events which are defined by the existing derivative contracts are primarily downgrades in the credit ratings of the company and its affiliates 

the fair value excluding cva of all derivative instruments with credit riskrelated contingent features that were in a net liability position at december 31 2021 and 2020 was  19 billion and  25 billion respectively the company posted  16 billion and  22 billion as collateral for this exposure in the normal course of business as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively 

a downgrade could trigger additional collateral or cash settlement requirements for the company and certain affiliates in the event that citigroup and citibank were downgraded a single notch by all three major rating agencies as of december 31 2021 the company could be required to post an additional  13 billion as either collateral or settlement of the derivative transactions in addition the company could be required to segregate with thirdparty custodians collateral previously received from existing derivative counterparties in the amount of  01 billion upon the single notch downgrade resulting in aggregate cash obligations and collateral requirements of approximately  14 billion 

derivatives accompanied by financial asset transfers 

the company executes total return swaps that provide it with synthetic exposure to substantially all of the economic return of the securities or other financial assets referenced in the contract in certain cases the derivative transaction is accompanied by the company’s transfer of the referenced financial asset to the derivative counterparty most typically in response to the derivative counterparty’s desire to hedge in whole or in part its synthetic exposure under the derivative contract by holding the referenced asset in funded form in certain jurisdictions these transactions qualify as sales resulting in derecognition of the securities transferred see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the related sale conditions for transfers of financial assets for a significant portion of the transactions the company has also executed another total return swap where the company passes on substantially all of the economic return of the referenced securities to a different third party seeking the exposure in those cases the company is not exposed on a net basis to changes in the economic return of the referenced securities 

these transactions generally involve the transfer of the company’s liquid government bonds convertible bonds or publicly traded corporate equity securities from the trading portfolio and are executed with thirdparty financial institutions the accompanying derivatives are typically total return swaps the derivatives are cash settled and subject to ongoing margin requirements 

when the conditions for sale accounting are met the company reports the transfer of the referenced financial asset as a sale and separately reports the accompanying derivative transaction these transactions generally do not result in a gain 

or loss on the sale of the security because the transferred security was held at fair value in the company’s trading portfolio for transfers of financial assets accounted for as a sale by the company and for which the company has retained substantially all of the economic exposure to the transferred asset through a total return swap executed with the same counterparty in contemplation of the initial sale and still outstanding both the asset amounts derecognized and the gross cash proceeds received as of the date of derecognition were  29 billion and  20 billion as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively 

at december 31 2021 the fair value of these previously derecognized assets was  29 billion the fair value of the total return swaps as of december 31 2021 was  13 million recorded as gross derivative assets and  58 million recorded as gross derivative liabilities at december 31 2020 the fair value of these previously derecognized assets was  22 billion and the fair value of the total return swaps was  135 million recorded as gross derivative assets and  7 million recorded as gross derivative liabilities 

the balances for the total return swaps are on a gross basis before the application of counterparty and cash collateral netting and are included primarily as equity derivatives in the tabular disclosures in this note 

23 concentrations of credit risk 

concentrations of credit risk exist when changes in economic industry or geographic factors similarly affect groups of counterparties whose aggregate credit exposure is material in relation to citigroup’s total credit exposure although citigroup’s portfolio of financial instruments is broadly diversified along industry product and geographic lines material transactions are completed with other financial institutions particularly in the securities trading derivatives and foreign exchange businesses 

in connection with the company’s efforts to maintain a diversified portfolio the company limits its exposure to any one geographic region country or individual creditor and monitors this exposure on a continuous basis at december 31 2021 citigroup’s most significant concentration of credit risk was with the us government and its agencies the company’s exposure which primarily results from trading assets and investments issued by the us government and its agencies amounted to  4145 billion and  3701 billion at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively the german united kingdom and japanese governments and their agencies which are rated investment grade by both moody’s and sp were the next largest exposures the company’s exposure to germany amounted to  489 billion and  518 billion at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively the company’s exposure to the united kingdom amounted to  311 billion and  260 billion at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively the company’s exposure to japan amounted to  301 billion and  355 billion at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively the foreign government exposures are composed of investment securities loans and trading assets 

the company’s exposure to states and municipalities amounted to  220 billion and  261 billion at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively and was composed of trading assets investment securities derivatives and lending activities 

24 fair value measurement 

asc 82010 fair value measurement  defines fair value establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value and requires disclosures about fair value measurements fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and therefore represents an exit price among other things the standard requires the company to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value 

under asc 82010 the probability of counterparty default is factored into the valuation of derivative and other positions and the impact of citigroup’s own credit risk is also factored into the valuation of derivatives and other liabilities that are measured at fair value 

fair value hierarchy 

asc 82010 specifies a hierarchy of inputs based on whether the inputs are observable or unobservable observable inputs are developed using market data and reflect market participant assumptions while unobservable inputs reflect the company’s market assumptions these two types of inputs have created the following fair value hierarchy 

• level 1 quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets 

• level 2 quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and modelderived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in the market 

• level 3 valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable  

as required under the fair value hierarchy the company considers relevant and observable market inputs in its valuations where possible 

the fair value hierarchy classification approach typically utilizes rulesbased and data driven selection criteria to determine whether an instrument is classified as level 1 level 2 or level 3 

• the determination of whether an instrument is quoted in an active market and therefore considered a level 1 instrument is based upon the frequency of observed transactions and the quality of independent market data available on the measurement date 

• a level 2 classification is assigned where there is observability of prices  market inputs to models or where any unobservable inputs are not significant to the valuation the determination of whether an input is considered observable is based on the availability of independent market data and its corroboration for example through observed transactions in the market 

• otherwise an instrument is classified as level 3 

determination of fair value 

for assets and liabilities carried at fair value the company measures fair value using the procedures set out below irrespective of whether the assets and liabilities are measured at fair value as a result of an election a nonrecurring lowerofcostormarket locom adjustment or because they are required to be measured at fair value 

when available the company uses quoted market prices from active markets to determine fair value and classifies such items as level 1 in some specific cases where a market price is available the company will apply practical expedients such as matrix pricing to calculate fair value in which case the items may be classified as level 2 

the company may also apply a pricebased methodology that utilizes where available quoted prices or other market information obtained from recent trading activity in positions with the same or similar characteristics to the position being valued if relevant and observable prices are available those valuations may be classified as level 2 however when there are one or more significant unobservable “price” inputs those valuations will be classified as level 3 furthermore when a quoted price is considered stale a significant adjustment to the price of a similar security may be necessary to reflect differences in the terms of the actual security or loan being valued or alternatively when prices from independent sources may be insufficient to corroborate a valuation the “price” inputs are considered unobservable and the fair value measurements are classified as level 3 

if quoted market prices are not available fair value is based upon internally developed valuation techniques that use where possible current marketbased parameters such as interest rates currency rates and option volatilities items valued using such internally generated valuation techniques are classified according to the lowest level input or value driver that is significant to the valuation thus an item may be classified as level 3 even though there may be some significant inputs that are readily observable 

fair value estimates from internal valuation techniques are verified where possible to prices obtained from independent vendors or brokers vendors’ and brokers’ valuations may be based on a variety of inputs ranging from observed prices to proprietary valuation models and the company assesses the quality and relevance of this information in determining the estimate of fair value the following section describes the valuation methodologies used by the company to measure various financial instruments at fair value where appropriate the description includes details of the valuation models the key inputs to those models and any significant assumptions 

market valuation adjustments 

generally the unit of account for a financial instrument is the individual financial instrument the company applies market valuation adjustments that are consistent with the unit of account which does not include adjustment due to the size of the company’s position except as follows asc 82010 permits an exception through an accounting policy election to measure the fair value of a portfolio of financial assets and financial liabilities on the basis of the net open risk position 

when certain criteria are met citi has elected to measure certain portfolios of financial instruments that meet those criteria such as derivatives on the basis of the net open risk position the company applies market valuation adjustments including adjustments to account for the size of the net open risk position consistent with market participant assumptions 

valuation adjustments are applied to items classified as level 2 or level 3 in the fair value hierarchy to ensure that the fair value reflects the price at which the net open risk position could be exited these valuation adjustments are based on the bidoffer spread for an instrument in the market when citi has elected to measure certain portfolios of financial investments such as derivatives on the basis of the net open risk position the valuation adjustment may take into account the size of the position 

credit valuation adjustments cva and funding valuation adjustments fva are applied to the relevant population of overthecounter otc derivative instruments where adjustments to reflect counterparty credit risk own credit risk and term funding risk are required to estimate fair value this principally includes derivatives with a base valuation eg discounted using overnight indexed swap ois requiring adjustment for these effects such as uncollateralized interest rate swaps the cva represents a portfoliolevel adjustment to reflect the risk premium associated with the counterparty’s assets or citi’s liabilities nonperformance risk 

the fva represents a market funding risk premium inherent in the uncollateralized portion of a derivative portfolio and in certain collateralized derivative portfolios that do not include standard credit support annexes csas such as where the csa does not permit the reuse of collateral received citi’s fva methodology leverages the existing cva methodology to estimate a funding exposure profile the calculation of this exposure profile considers collateral agreements in which the terms do not permit the company to reuse the collateral received including where counterparties post collateral to thirdparty custodians citi’s cva and fva methodologies consist of two steps 

• first the exposure profile for each counterparty is determined using the terms of all individual derivative positions and a monte carlo simulation or other quantitative analysis to generate a series of expected cash flows at future points in time the calculation of this exposure profile considers the effect of credit risk mitigants and sources of funding including pledged cash or other collateral and any legal right of offset that exists with a counterparty through arrangements such as netting agreements individual derivative contracts that are subject to an enforceable master netting agreement with a counterparty are aggregated as a netting set for this purpose since it is those aggregate net cash flows that are subject to nonperformance risk this process identifies specific pointintime future cash flows that are subject to nonperformance and term funding risk rather than using the current recognized net asset or liability as a basis to measure the cva and fva 

• second for cva marketbased views of default probabilities derived from observed credit spreads in the 

credit default swap cds market are applied to the expected future cash flows determined in step one citi’s own credit cva is determined using citispecific cds spreads for the relevant tenor generally counterparty cva is determined using cds spread indices for each credit rating and tenor for certain identified netting sets where individual analysis is practicable eg exposures to counterparties with liquid cdss counterpartyspecific cds spreads are used for fva a term structure of spreads is applied to the expected funding exposures eg the market liquidity spread used to represent the term funding premium associated with certain otc derivatives 

the cva and fva are designed to incorporate a market view of the credit and funding risk respectively inherent in the derivative portfolio however most unsecured derivative instruments are negotiated bilateral contracts and are not commonly transferred to third parties derivative instruments are normally settled contractually or if terminated early are terminated at a value negotiated bilaterally between the counterparties thus the cva and fva may not be realized upon a settlement or termination in the normal course of business in addition all or a portion of these adjustments may be reversed or otherwise adjusted in future periods in the event of changes in the credit or funding risk associated with the derivative instruments 

the table below summarizes the cva and fva applied to the fair value of derivative instruments at december 31 2021 and 2020 



the table below summarizes pretax gains losses related to changes in cva on derivative instruments net of hedges fva on derivatives and debt valuation adjustments dva on citi’s own fair value option fvo liabilities for the years indicated 



1 see notes 1 17 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements 

securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under agreements to repurchase 

no quoted prices exist for these instruments since fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow technique cash flows are estimated based on the terms of the contract taking into account any embedded derivative or other features these cash flows are discounted using interest rates appropriate to the maturity of the instrument as well as the nature of the underlying collateral generally when such instruments are recorded at fair value they are classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as the inputs used in the valuation are readily observable however certain longdated positions are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy 

trading account assets and liabilities—trading securities and trading loans 

when available the company uses quoted market prices in active markets to determine the fair value of trading securities such items are classified as level 1 of the fair value hierarchy examples include government securities and exchangetraded equity securities 

for bonds and secondary market loans traded over the counter the company generally determines fair value utilizing various valuation techniques including discounted cash flows pricebased and internal models fair value estimates from these internal valuation techniques are verified where possible to prices obtained from independent sources including thirdparty vendors a pricebased methodology utilizes where available quoted prices or other market information obtained from recent trading activity of assets with similar characteristics to the bond or loan being valued the yields used in discounted cash flow models are derived from the same price information trading securities and loans priced using such methods are generally classified as level 2 however when the primary inputs to the valuation are unobservable or prices from independent sources are insufficient to corroborate valuation a loan or security is generally classified as level 3 fair value estimates from these internal valuation techniques are verified where possible to 

prices obtained from independent sources including thirdparty vendors 

when the company’s principal exit market for a portfolio of loans is through securitization the company uses the securitization price as a key input into the fair value of the loan portfolio the securitization price is determined from the assumed proceeds of a hypothetical securitization within the current market environment where such a price verification is possible loan portfolios are typically classified as level 2 in the fair value hierarchy 

for most of the subprime mortgage backed security mbs exposures fair value is determined utilizing observable transactions where available or other valuation techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis utilizing valuation assumptions derived from similar more observable securities as market proxies the valuation of certain assetbacked security abs cdo positions is inferred through the net asset value of the underlying assets of the abs cdo 

trading account assets and liabilities—derivatives 

exchangetraded derivatives measured at fair value using quoted ie exchange prices in active markets where available are classified as level 1 of the fair value hierarchy 

derivatives without a quoted price in an active market and derivatives executed over the counter are valued using internal valuation techniques these derivative instruments are classified as either level 2 or level 3 depending on the observability of the significant inputs to the model 

the valuation techniques depend on the type of derivative and the nature of the underlying instrument the principal techniques used to value these instruments are discounted cash flows and internal models such as derivative pricing models eg blackscholes and monte carlo simulations 

the key inputs depend upon the type of derivative and the nature of the underlying instrument and include interest rate yield curves foreign exchange rates volatilities and correlation 

investments 

the investments category includes availableforsale debt and marketable equity securities whose fair values are generally determined by utilizing similar procedures described for trading securities above or in some cases using vendor pricing as the primary source 

also included in investments are nonpublic investments in private equity and real estate entities determining the fair value of nonpublic securities involves a significant degree of management’s judgment as no quoted prices exist and such securities are not generally traded in addition there may be transfer restrictions on private equity securities the company’s process for determining the fair value of such securities utilizes commonly accepted valuation techniques including guideline public company analysis and comparable 

transactions in determining the fair value of nonpublic securities the company also considers events such as a proposed sale of the investee company initial public offerings equity issuances or other observable transactions private equity securities are generally classified as level 3 of the fair value hierarchy 

in addition the company holds investments in certain alternative investment funds that calculate nav per share including hedge funds private equity funds and real estate funds investments in funds are generally classified as nonmarketable equity securities carried at fair value the fair values of these investments are estimated using the nav per share of the company’s ownership interest in the funds where it is not probable that the investment will be realized at a price other than the nav consistent with the provisions of asu 201507 these investments are categorized within the fair value hierarchy and are not included in the tables below see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

shortterm borrowings and longterm debt 

where fair value accounting has been elected the fair value of nonstructured liabilities is determined by utilizing internal models using the appropriate discount rate for the applicable maturity such instruments are classified as level 2 of the fair value hierarchy when all significant inputs are readily observable 

the company determines the fair value of hybrid financial instruments including structured liabilities using the appropriate derivative valuation methodology described above in “trading account assets and liabilities—derivatives” given the nature of the embedded risk profile such instruments are classified as level 2 or level 3 depending on the observability of significant inputs to the model 

items measured at fair value on a recurring basis 

the following tables present for each of the fair value hierarchy levels the company’s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis at december 31 2021 and 2020 the company may hedge positions that have 

been classified in the level 3 category with other financial instruments hedging instruments that may be classified as level 3 but also with financial instruments classified as level 1 or level 2 the effects of these hedges are presented gross in the following tables

the following tables present the changes in the level 3 fair value category for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 the gains and losses presented below include changes in the fair value related to both observable and unobservable inputs 

the company often hedges positions with offsetting positions that are classified in a different level for example 

the gains and losses for assets and liabilities in the level 3 category presented in the tables below do not reflect the effect of offsetting losses and gains on hedging instruments that may be classified in the level 1 and level 2 categories in addition the company hedges items classified in the level 3 category with instruments also classified in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy the hedged items and related hedges are presented gross in the following tables

level 3 fair value rollforward 

the following were the significant level 3 transfers for the period december 31 2020 to december 31 2021 

• during the 12 months ended december 31 2021 transfers of loans of  21 billion from level 3 to level 2 were primarily driven by equity forward and volatility inputs that have been assessed as not significant to the overall valuation of certain hybrid loan instruments including equity options and long dated equity call spreads 

• during the 12 months ended december 31 2021 transfers of equity contracts of  11 billion from level 2 to level 3 were due to equity forward and volatility inputs becoming an unobservable andor significant input relative to the overall valuation of equity options and equity swaps in other instances market changes have resulted in observable equity forward and volatility inputs becoming an insignificant input to the overall valuation of the instrument eg when an option becomes deepin or deepout of the money this has resulted in  19 billion of certain equity contracts being transferred from level 3 to level 2 

• during the 12 months ended december 31 2021 transfers of longterm debt were  86 billion from level 2 to level 3 of the  86 billion transfer in approximately  72 billion related to interest rate option volatility inputs becoming unobservable andor significant relative to their 

overall valuation and  10 billion related to equity volatility inputs in addition to other volatility inputs eg interest rate volatility inputs becoming unobservable andor significant to their overall valuation in other instances market changes have resulted in some inputs becoming more observable and some unobservable inputs becoming less significant to the overall valuation of the instruments eg when an option becomes deepin or deepout of the money  this has resulted in  98 billion of certain structured longterm debt products being transferred from level 3 to level 2 during the 12 months ended december 31 2021 

the following were the significant level 3 transfers for the period december 31 2019 to december 31 2020 

• during the 12 months ended december 31 2020 transfers of interest rate contracts of  16 billion from level 2 to level 3 were due to interest rate option volatility becoming an unobservable andor significant input relative to the overall valuation of inflation and other interest rate derivatives 

• during the 12 months ended december 31 2020  66 billion of longterm debt containing embedded derivatives was transferred from level 2 to level 3 as a result of interest rate option volatility equity correlation and credit derivative inputs becoming unobservable andor significant input relative to the overall valuation of certain structured longterm debt products in other instances market changes resulted in unobservable 

volatility inputs becoming insignificant to the overall valuation of the instrument eg when an option becomes deepin or deepout of the money this has resulted in  26 billion of certain structured longterm debt products being transferred from level 3 to level 2 during the 12 months ended december 31 2020 

valuation techniques and inputs for level 3 fair 

value measurements 

the company’s level 3 inventory consists of both cash 

instruments and derivatives of varying complexity 

the following tables present the valuation techniques covering the majority of level 3 inventory and the most 

significant unobservable inputs used in level 3 fair value measurements differences between this table and amounts presented in the level 3 fair value rollforward table represent individually immaterial items that have been measured using a variety of valuation techniques other than those listed 









1 the tables above include the fair values for the items listed and may not foot to the total population for each category 

2 some inputs are shown as zero due to rounding 

3 when the low and high inputs are the same there is either a constant input applied to all positions or the methodology involving the input applies to only one large position 

4 weighted averages are calculated based on the fair values of the instruments 

5 for equity securities the price inputs are expressed on an absolute basis not as a percentage of the notional amount 

6 both trading and nontrading account derivatives—assets and liabilities—are presented on a gross absolute value basis 

7 includes hybrid products 

uncertainty of fair value measurements relating to unobservable inputs 

valuation uncertainty arises when there is insufficient or disperse market data to allow a precise determination of the exit value of a fairvalued position or portfolio in today’s market this is especially prevalent in level 3 fair value instruments where uncertainty exists in valuation inputs that may be both unobservable and significant to the instrument’s or portfolio’s overall fair value measurement the uncertainties associated with key unobservable inputs on the level 3 fair value measurements may not be independent of one another in addition the amount and direction of the uncertainty on a fair value measurement for a given change in an unobservable input depends on the nature of the instrument as well as whether the company holds the instrument as an asset or a liability for certain instruments the pricing hedging and risk management are sensitive to the correlation between various inputs rather than on the analysis and aggregation of the individual inputs 

the following section describes some of the most significant unobservable inputs used by the company in level 3 fair value measurements 

correlation 

correlation is a measure of the extent to which two or more variables change in relation to each other a variety of correlationrelated assumptions are required for a wide range of instruments including equity and credit baskets foreign exchange options credit index tranches and many other instruments for almost all of these instruments correlations are not directly observable in the market and must be calculated using alternative sources including historical information estimating correlation can be especially difficult where it may vary over time and calculating correlation information from market data requires significant assumptions regarding the informational efficiency of the market eg swaption markets uncertainty therefore exists when an estimate of the appropriate level of correlation as an input into some fair value measurements is required 

changes in correlation levels can have a substantial impact favorable or unfavorable on the value of an instrument depending on its nature a change in the default correlation of the fair value of the underlying bonds comprising a cdo structure would affect the fair value of the senior tranche for example an increase in the default correlation of the underlying bonds would reduce the fair value of the senior tranche because highly correlated instruments produce greater losses in the event of default and a portion of these losses would become attributable to the senior tranche that same change in default correlation would have a different impact on junior tranches of the same structure 

volatility 

volatility represents the speed and severity of market price changes and is a key factor in pricing options volatility generally depends on the tenor of the underlying instrument and the strike price or level defined in the contract volatilities for certain combinations of tenor and strike are not observable and need to be estimated using alternative methods such as comparable instruments historical analysis or other sources of 

market information this leads to uncertainty around the final fair value measurement of instruments with unobservable volatilities 

the general relationship between changes in the value of an instrument or a portfolio to changes in volatility also depends on changes in interest rates and the level of the underlying index generally long option positions assets benefit from increases in volatility whereas short option positions liabilities will suffer losses some instruments are more sensitive to changes in volatility than others for example an atthemoney option would experience a greater percentage change in its fair value than a deepinthemoney option in addition the fair value of an option with more than one underlying security eg an option on a basket of equities depends on the volatility of the individual underlying securities as well as their correlations 

yield 

in some circumstances the yield of an instrument is not observable in the market and must be estimated from historical data or from yields of similar securities this estimated yield may need to be adjusted to capture the characteristics of the security being valued whenever the amount of the adjustment is significant to the value of the security the fair value measurement is classified as level 3 

adjusted yield is generally used to discount the projected future principal and interest cash flows on instruments such as assetbacked securities adjusted yield is impacted by changes in the interest rate environment and relevant credit spreads 

prepayment 

voluntary unscheduled payments prepayments change the future cash flows for the investor and thereby change the fair value of the security the effect of prepayments is more pronounced for residential mortgagebacked securities prepayment is generally negatively correlated with delinquency and interest rate a combination of low prepayments and high delinquencies amplifies each input’s negative impact on a mortgage securities’ valuation as prepayment speeds change the weighted average life of the security changes which impacts the valuation either positively or negatively depending upon the nature of the security and the direction of the change in the weighted average life 

recovery 

recovery is the proportion of the total outstanding balance of a bond or loan that is expected to be collected in a liquidation scenario for many credit securities eg commercial mortgage backed securities the expected recovery amount of a defaulted property is typically unknown until a liquidation of the property is imminent the assumed recovery of a security may differ from its actual recovery that will be observable in the future generally an increase in the recovery rate assumption increases the fair value of the security an increase in loss severity the inverse of the recovery rate reduces the amount of principal available for distribution and as a result decreases the fair value of the security 

credit spread 

credit spread is a component of the security representing its credit quality credit spread reflects the market perception of changes in prepayment delinquency and recovery rates therefore capturing the impact of other variables on the fair value changes in credit spread affect the fair value of 

securities differently depending on the characteristics and maturity profile of the security for example credit spread is a more significant driver of the fair value measurement of a high yield bond as compared to an investment grade bond generally the credit spread for an investment grade bond is also more observable and less volatile than its high yield counterpart 

items measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis 

certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and therefore are not included in the tables above these include assets measured at cost that have been written down to fair value during the periods as a result of an impairment these also include nonmarketable equity securities that have been measured using the measurement alternative and are either i written down to fair value during the periods as a result of an impairment or ii adjusted upward or downward to fair value as a result of a transaction observed during the periods for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer in addition these assets include loans heldforsale and other real estate owned that are measured at the lower of cost or market value 

the following tables present the carrying amounts of all assets that were still held for which a nonrecurring fair value measurement was recorded 





1 net of fair value amounts on the unfunded portion of loans hfs recognized as other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 

2 represents impaired loans held for investment whose carrying amount is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell primarily real estate 

the fair value of loans hfs is determined where possible using quoted secondarymarket prices if no such quoted price exists the fair value of a loan is determined using quoted prices for a similar asset or assets adjusted for the specific attributes of that loan fair value for the other real estate owned is based on appraisals for loans whose carrying amount is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral the fair values depend on the type of collateral fair value of the collateral is typically estimated based on quoted market prices if available appraisals or other internal valuation techniques 

where the fair value of the related collateral is based on an appraised value the loan is generally classified as level 3 in addition for corporate loans appraisals of the collateral are often based on sales of similar assets however because the prices of similar assets require significant adjustments to reflect the unique features of the underlying collateral these fair value measurements are generally classified as level 3 

the fair value of nonmarketable equity securities under the measurement alternative is based on observed transaction prices for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer or an internal valuation technique in the case of an impairment where there are insufficient market observations to conclude the inputs are observable where significant adjustments are made to the observed transaction prices or when an internal valuation technique is used the security is classified as level 3 fair value may differ from the observed transaction price due to a number of factors including marketability adjustments and differences in rights and obligations when the observed transaction is not for the identical investment held by citi 

valuation techniques and inputs for level 3 nonrecurring fair value measurements 

the following tables present the valuation techniques covering the majority of level 3 nonrecurring fair value measurements and the most significant unobservable inputs used in those measurements 





1 the table above includes the fair values for the items listed and may not foot to the total population for each category 

2 some inputs are shown as zero due to rounding 

3 weighted averages are calculated based on the fair values of the instruments 

4 appraised values are disclosed in whole dollars 

5 represents impaired loans held for investment whose carrying amount is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell primarily real estate 

nonrecurring fair value changes 

the following tables present total nonrecurring fair value measurements for the period included in earnings attributable to the change in fair value relating to assets that were still held 





1 represents impaired loans held for investment whose carrying amount is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell primarily real estate 

estimated fair value of financial instruments not carried at fair value 

the following tables present the carrying value and fair value of citigroup’s financial instruments that are not carried at fair value the tables below therefore exclude items measured at fair value on a recurring basis presented in the tables above 

the disclosure also excludes leases affiliate investments pension and benefit obligations certain insurance contracts and taxrelated items also as required the disclosure excludes the effect of taxes any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the entire holdings of a particular instrument excess fair value associated with deposits with no fixed maturity and other expenses that would be incurred in a market transaction in addition the tables exclude the values of nonfinancial assets and liabilities as well as a wide range of franchise relationship and intangible values which are integral to a full assessment of citigroup’s financial position and the value of its net assets 

fair values vary from period to period based on changes in a wide range of factors including interest rates credit quality and market perceptions of value and as existing assets and liabilities run off and new transactions are entered into 





1 the carrying value of loans is net of the allowance for credit losses on loans of  165 billion for december 31 2021 and  250 billion for december 31 2020 in addition the carrying values exclude  05 billion and  07 billion of lease finance receivables at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively 

2 includes items measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis 

3 includes cash and due from banks deposits with banks brokerage receivables reinsurance recoverables and other financial instruments included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet for all of which the carrying value is a reasonable estimate of fair value 

4 the carrying value includes longterm debt balances under qualifying fair value hedges 

5 includes brokerage payables separate and variable accounts shortterm borrowings carried at cost and other financial instruments included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet for all of which the carrying value is a reasonable estimate of fair value 

the estimated fair values of the company’s corporate unfunded lending commitments at december 31 2021 and 2020 were offbalance liabilities of  81 billion and  73 billion respectively substantially all of which are classified as level 3 the company does not estimate the fair values of consumer unfunded lending commitments which are generally cancellable by providing notice to the borrower 

25 fair value elections 

the company may elect to report most financial instruments and certain other items at fair value on an instrumentbyinstrument basis with changes in fair value reported in earnings other than dva see below the election is made upon the initial recognition of an eligible financial asset financial liability or firm commitment or when certain specified reconsideration events occur the fair value election may not otherwise be revoked once an election is made the 

changes in fair value are recorded in current earnings movements in dva are reported as a component of aoci  additional discussion regarding the applicable areas in which fair value elections were made is presented in note 24 to the consolidated financial statements 

the company has elected fair value accounting for its mortgage servicing rights msrs see note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on citi’s msrs 

the following table presents the changes in fair value of those items for which the fair value option has been elected 



1 includes gains losses associated with interest rate lock commitments for those loans that have been originated and elected under the fair value option 

2 includes dva that is included in aoci  see notes 19 and 24 to the consolidated financial statements 

own debt valuation adjustments dva 

own debt valuation adjustments are recognized on citi’s liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected using citi’s credit spreads observed in the bond market changes in fair value of fair value option liabilities related to changes in citigroup’s own credit spreads dva are reflected as a component of aoci  see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

among other variables the fair value of liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected other than nonrecourse debt and similar liabilities is impacted by the narrowing or widening of the company’s credit spreads 

the estimated changes in the fair value of these nonderivative liabilities due to such changes in the company’s own credit spread or instrumentspecific credit risk were a gain of  296 million and a loss of  616 million for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively changes in fair value resulting from changes in instrumentspecific credit risk were estimated by incorporating the company’s current credit spreads observable in the bond market into the relevant valuation technique used to value each liability as described above 

the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 

selected portfolios of securities purchased under agreements to resell securities borrowed securities sold under agreements to repurchase securities loaned and certain uncollateralized shortterm borrowings 

the company elected the fair value option for certain portfolios of fixed income securities purchased under agreements to resell and fixed income securities sold under 

agreements to repurchase securities borrowed securities loaned and certain uncollateralized shortterm borrowings held primarily by brokerdealer entities in the united states the united kingdom and japan in each case the election was made because the related interest rate risk is managed on a portfolio basis primarily with offsetting derivative instruments that are accounted for at fair value through earnings 

changes in fair value for transactions in these portfolios are recorded in principal transactions  the related interest revenue and interest expense are measured based on the contractual rates specified in the transactions and are reported as interest revenue and interest expense in the consolidated statement of income 

certain loans and other credit products 

citigroup has also elected the fair value option for certain other originated and purchased loans including certain unfunded loan products such as guarantees and letters of credit executed by citigroup’s lending and trading businesses none of these credit products are highly leveraged financing commitments significant groups of transactions include loans and unfunded loan products that are expected to be either sold or securitized in the near term or transactions where the economic risks are hedged with derivative instruments such as purchased credit default swaps or total return swaps where the company pays the total return on the underlying loans to a third party citigroup has elected the fair value option to mitigate accounting mismatches in cases where hedge accounting is complex and to achieve operational simplifications fair value was not elected for most lending transactions across the company 

the following table provides information about certain credit products carried at fair value 



in addition to the amounts reported above  719 million and  1068 million of unfunded commitments related to certain credit products selected for fair value accounting were outstanding as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively 

changes in the fair value of funded and unfunded credit products are classified in principal transactions in citi’s consolidated statement of income related interest revenue is measured based on the contractual interest rates and reported as interest revenue on trading account assets or loan interest depending on the balance sheet classifications of the credit products the changes in fair value for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 due to instrumentspecific credit risk totaled to a loss of  21 million and a loss of  16 million respectively 

certain investments in unallocated precious metals 

citigroup invests in unallocated precious metals accounts gold silver platinum and palladium as part of its commodity and foreign currency trading activities or to economically hedge certain exposures from issuing structured liabilities under asc 815 the investment is bifurcated into a debt host contract and a commodity forward derivative instrument citigroup elects the fair value option for the debt host contract and reports the debt host contract within trading account assets on the company’s consolidated balance sheet the total carrying amount of debt host contracts across unallocated precious metals accounts was approximately  03 billion and  05 billion at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively the amounts are expected to fluctuate based on trading activity in future periods 

as part of its commodity and foreign currency trading activities citi trades unallocated precious metals investments and executes forward purchase and forward sale derivative contracts with trading counterparties when citi sells an unallocated precious metals investment citi’s receivable from its depository bank is repaid and citi derecognizes its investment in the unallocated precious metal the forward purchase or sale contract with the trading counterparty indexed to unallocated precious metals is accounted for as a derivative at fair value through earnings as of december 31 2021 there were approximately  152 billion and  105 billion of notional amounts of such forward purchase and forward sale derivative contracts outstanding respectively 

certain investments in private equity and real estate ventures 

citigroup invests in private equity and real estate ventures for the purpose of earning investment returns and for capital appreciation the company has elected the fair value option for certain of these ventures because such investments are considered similar to many private equity or hedge fund activities in citi’s investment companies which are reported at fair value the fair value option brings consistency in the accounting and evaluation of these investments all investments debt and equity in such private equity and real estate entities are accounted for at fair value these investments are classified as investments on citigroup’s consolidated balance sheet 

changes in the fair values of these investments are classified in other revenue in the company’s consolidated statement of income 

certain mortgage loans heldforsale hfs 

citigroup has elected the fair value option for certain purchased and originated prime fixedrate and conforming adjustablerate first mortgage loans hfs these loans are intended for sale or securitization and are hedged with derivative instruments the company has elected the fair value option to mitigate accounting mismatches in cases where hedge accounting is complex and to achieve operational simplifications

the changes in the fair values of these mortgage loans are reported in other revenue in the company’s consolidated statement of income there was no net change in fair value during the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 due to instrumentspecific credit risk related interest income continues to be measured based on the contractual interest rates and reported as interest revenue in the consolidated statement of income 

certain debt liabilities 

the company has elected the fair value option for certain debt liabilities the company elected the fair value option because these exposures are considered to be tradingrelated positions and therefore they are managed on a fair value basis these positions will continue to be classified as debt deposits or derivatives classified as trading account liabilities on the company’s consolidated balance sheet according to their legal form 

the following table provides information about the carrying value of notes carried at fair value disaggregated by type of risk 



the portion of the changes in fair value attributable to changes in citigroup’s own credit spreads ie dva is reflected as a component of aoci while all other changes in fair value are reported in principal transactions  changes in the fair value of these liabilities include accrued interest which is also included in the change in fair value reported in principal transactions  

certain nonstructured liabilities 

the company has elected the fair value option for certain nonstructured liabilities with fixed and floating interest rates the company has elected the fair value option where the interest rate risk of such liabilities may be economically hedged with derivative contracts or the proceeds are used to purchase 

financial assets that will also be accounted for at fair value through earnings the elections have been made to mitigate accounting mismatches and to achieve operational simplifications these positions are reported in shortterm borrowings and longterm debt on the company’s consolidated balance sheet the portion of the changes in fair value attributable to changes in citigroup’s own credit spreads ie dva is reflected as a component of aoci while all other changes in fair value are reported in principal transactions  

interest expense on nonstructured liabilities is measured based on the contractual interest rates and reported as interest expense in the consolidated statement of income 

the following table provides information about longterm debt carried at fair value 



the following table provides information about shortterm borrowings carried at fair value 



26 pledged assets collateral guarantees and commitments 

pledged assets 

in connection with citi’s financing and trading activities citi has pledged assets to collateralize its obligations under repurchase agreements secured financing agreements secured liabilities of consolidated vies and other borrowings the approximate carrying values of the significant components of pledged assets recognized on citi’s consolidated balance sheet included the following 

 

restricted cash 

citigroup defines restricted cash as cash subject to withdrawal restrictions to include cash deposited with central banks that must be maintained to meet minimum regulatory requirements and cash set aside for the benefit of customers or for other purposes such as compensating balance arrangements or debt retirement restricted cash includes minimum reserve requirements with the federal reserve bank and certain other central banks and cash segregated to satisfy rules regarding the protection of customer assets as required by citigroup brokerdealers’ primary regulators including the united states securities and exchange commission sec the commodity futures trading commission and the united kingdom’s prudential regulation authority 

restricted cash is included on the consolidated balance sheet within the following balance sheet lines 



in addition included in cash and due from banks and deposits with banks at december 31 2021 and 2020 were  137 billion and  94 billion respectively of cash segregated under federal and other brokerage regulations or deposited with clearing organizations 

collateral 

at december 31 2021 and 2020 the approximate fair value of collateral received by citi that may be resold or repledged excluding the impact of allowable netting was  6508 billion and  6716 billion respectively this collateral was received in connection with resale agreements securities borrowings and loans securities for securities lending transactions derivative transactions and margined broker loans 

at december 31 2021 and 2020 a substantial portion of the collateral received by citi had been sold or repledged in connection with repurchase agreements securities sold not yet purchased securities lendings pledges to clearing organizations segregation requirements under securities laws and regulations derivative transactions and bank loans 

in addition at december 31 2021 and 2020 citi had pledged  4810 billion and  4707 billion respectively of collateral that may not be sold or repledged by the secured parties 

leases 

the company’s operating leases where citi is a lessee include real estate such as office space and branches and various types of equipment these leases may contain renewal and extension options and early termination features however these options do not impact the lease term unless the company is reasonably certain that it will exercise the options these leases have a weightedaverage remaining lease term of approximately six years as of december 31 2021 and 2020 the operating lease rou asset was  29 billion and  28 billion as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively the operating lease rou liability was  31 billion and  31 billion as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively the company recognizes fixed lease costs on a straightline basis throughout the lease term in the consolidated statement of income in addition variable lease costs are recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred the total operating lease expense principally for offices branches and equipment net of  12 million and  27 million of sublease income was  1061 million and  1054 million for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively 

the table below provides the cash flow statement supplemental information 



1 represents noncash activity and accordingly is not reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows 

2 excludes the decrease in the rightofuse assets related to the purchase of a previously leased property 

citi’s future lease payments are as follows 



operating lease expense was  11 billion for the year ended december 31 2019 

guarantees 

citi provides a variety of guarantees and indemnifications to its customers to enhance their credit standing and enable them to complete a wide variety of business transactions for 

certain contracts meeting the definition of a guarantee the guarantor must recognize at inception a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 

in addition the guarantor must disclose the maximum potential amount of future payments that the guarantor could be required to make under the guarantee if there were a total 

default by the guaranteed parties the determination of the maximum potential future payments is based on the notional amount of the guarantees without consideration of possible recoveries under recourse provisions or from collateral held or pledged as such citi believes such amounts bear no relationship to the anticipated losses if any on these guarantees 

the following tables present information about citi’s guarantees 





1 the carrying values of securities lending indemnifications were not material for either period presented as the probability of potential liabilities arising from these guarantees is minimal 

2 at december 31 2021 and 2020 this maximum potential exposure was estimated to be  119 billion and  102 billion respectively however citi believes that the maximum exposure is not representative of the actual potential loss exposure based on its historical experience this contingent liability is unlikely to arise as most products and services are delivered when purchased and amounts are refunded when items are returned to merchants 

financial standby letters of credit 

citi issues standby letters of credit which substitute its own credit for that of the borrower if a letter of credit is drawn down the borrower is obligated to repay citi standby letters of credit protect a third party from defaults on contractual obligations financial standby letters of credit include i guarantees of payment of insurance premiums and reinsurance risks that support industrial revenue bond underwriting ii settlement of payment obligations to clearing houses including futures and overthecounter derivatives clearing see further discussion below iii support options and purchases of securities in lieu of escrow deposit accounts and iv letters of credit that backstop loans credit facilities promissory notes and trade acceptances 

performance guarantees 

performance guarantees and letters of credit are issued to guarantee a customer’s tender bid on a construction or systemsinstallation project or to guarantee completion of such projects in accordance with contract terms they are also issued to support a customer’s obligation to supply specified products commodities or maintenance or warranty services to a third party 

derivative instruments considered to be guarantees 

derivatives are financial instruments whose cash flows are based on a notional amount and an underlying instrument reference credit or index where there is little or no initial investment and whose terms require or permit net settlement for a discussion of citi’s derivatives activities see note 22 to the consolidated financial statements 

derivative instruments considered to be guarantees include only those instruments that require citi to make payments to the counterparty based on changes in an underlying instrument that is related to an asset a liability or an equity security held by the guaranteed party more specifically derivative instruments considered to be guarantees include certain overthecounter written put options where the counterparty is not a bank hedge fund or brokerdealer such counterparties are considered to be dealers in these markets and may therefore not hold the underlying instruments credit derivatives sold by citi are excluded from the tables above as they are disclosed separately in note 22 to the consolidated financial statements in instances where citi’s maximum potential future payment is unlimited the notional amount of the contract is disclosed 

loans sold with recourse 

loans sold with recourse represent citi’s obligations to reimburse the buyers for loan losses under certain circumstances recourse refers to the clause in a sales agreement under which a sellerlender will fully reimburse the buyerinvestor for any losses resulting from the purchased loans this may be accomplished by the sellers taking back any loans that become delinquent 

in addition to the amounts shown in the tables above citi has recorded a repurchase reserve for its potential repurchases or makewhole liability regarding residential mortgage representation and warranty claims related to its whole loan sales to us governmentsponsored agencies and to a lesser 

extent private investors the repurchase reserve was approximately  19 million and  31 million at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively and these amounts are included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 

securities lending indemnifications 

owners of securities frequently lend those securities for a fee to other parties who may sell them short or deliver them to another party to satisfy some other obligation banks may administer such securities lending programs for their clients securities lending indemnifications are issued by the bank to guarantee that a securities lending customer will be made whole in the event that the security borrower does not return the security subject to the lending agreement and collateral held is insufficient to cover the market value of the security 

credit card merchant processing 

credit card merchant processing guarantees represent the company’s indirect obligations in connection with i providing transaction processing services to various merchants with respect to its private label cards and ii potential liability for bank card transaction processing services the nature of the liability in either case arises as a result of a billing dispute between a merchant and a cardholder that is ultimately resolved in the cardholder’s favor the merchant is liable to refund the amount to the cardholder in general if the credit card processing company is unable to collect this amount from the merchant the credit card processing company bears the loss for the amount of the credit or refund paid to the cardholder 

with regard to i above citi has the primary contingent liability with respect to its portfolio of private label merchants the risk of loss is mitigated as the cash flows between citi and the merchant are settled on a net basis and citi has the right to offset any payments with cash flows otherwise due to the merchant to further mitigate this risk citi may delay settlement require a merchant to make an escrow deposit include event triggers to provide citi with more financial and operational control in the event of the financial deterioration of the merchant or require various credit enhancements including letters of credit and bank guarantees in the unlikely event that a private label merchant is unable to deliver products services or a refund to its private label cardholders citi is contingently liable to credit or refund cardholders 

with regard to ii above citi has a potential liability for bank card transactions where citi provides the transaction processing services as well as those where a third party provides the services and citi acts as a secondary guarantor should that processor fail to perform 

citi’s maximum potential contingent liability related to both bank card and private label merchant processing services is estimated to be the total volume of credit card transactions that meet the requirements to be valid chargeback transactions at any given time at december 31 2021 and 2020 this maximum potential exposure was estimated to be  1194 billion and  1019 billion respectively 

however citi believes that the maximum exposure is not representative of the actual potential loss exposure based on its historical experience this contingent liability is unlikely to arise as most products and services are delivered when 

purchased and amounts are refunded when items are returned to merchants citi assesses the probability and amount of its contingent liability related to merchant processing based on the financial strength of the primary guarantor the extent and nature of unresolved chargebacks and its historical loss experience at december 31 2021 and 2020 the losses incurred and the carrying amounts of citi’s contingent obligations related to merchant processing activities were immaterial 

credit card arrangements with partners 

citi in one of its credit card partner arrangements provides guarantees to the partner regarding the volume of certain customer originations during the term of the agreement to the extent that such origination targets are not met the guarantees serve to compensate the partner for certain payments that otherwise would have been generated in connection with such originations 

other guarantees and indemnifications 

credit card protection programs 

citi through its credit card businesses provides various cardholder protection programs on several of its card products including programs that provide coverage for certain losses associated with purchased products and protection for certain travelrelated purchases these guarantees are not included in the table since the total outstanding amount of the guarantees and citi’s maximum exposure to loss cannot be quantified the protection is limited to certain types of purchases and losses and it is not possible to quantify the purchases that would qualify for these benefits at any given time citi assesses the probability and amount of its potential liability related to these programs based on the extent and nature of its historical loss experience at december 31 2021 and 2020 the actual and estimated losses incurred and the carrying value of citi’s obligations related to these programs were immaterial 

other representation and warranty indemnifications 

in the normal course of business citi provides standard representations and warranties to counterparties in contracts in connection with numerous transactions and also provides indemnifications including indemnifications that protect the counterparties to the contracts in the event that additional taxes are owed due either to a change in the tax law or an adverse interpretation of the tax law counterparties to these transactions provide citi with comparable indemnifications while such representations warranties and indemnifications are essential components of many contractual relationships they do not represent the underlying business purpose for the transactions the indemnification clauses are often standard contractual terms related to citi’s own performance under the terms of a contract and are entered into in the normal course of business based on an assessment that the risk of loss is remote often these clauses are intended to ensure that terms of a contract are met at inception no compensation is received for these standard representations and warranties and it is not possible to determine their fair value because they rarely if 

ever result in a payment in many cases there are no stated or notional amounts included in the indemnification clauses and the contingencies potentially triggering the obligation to indemnify have not occurred and are not expected to occur as a result these indemnifications are not included in the tables above 

valuetransfer networks including exchanges and clearing houses vtns 

citi is a member of or shareholder in hundreds of valuetransfer networks vtns payment clearing and settlement systems as well as exchanges around the world as a condition of membership many of these vtns require that members stand ready to pay a pro rata share of the losses incurred by the organization due to another member’s default on its obligations citi’s potential obligations may be limited to its membership interests in the vtns contributions to the vtn’s funds or in certain narrow cases to the full pro rata share the maximum exposure is difficult to estimate as this would require an assessment of claims that have not yet occurred however citi believes the risk of loss is remote given historical experience with the vtns accordingly citi’s participation in vtns is not reported in the guarantees tables above and there are no amounts reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2021 or 2020 for potential obligations that could arise from citi’s involvement with vtn associations 

longterm care insurance indemnification 

in 2000 travelers life  annuity travelers then a subsidiary of citi entered into a reinsurance agreement to transfer the risks and rewards of its longterm care ltc business to ge life now genworth financial inc or genworth then a subsidiary of the general electric company ge as part of this transaction the reinsurance obligations were provided by two regulated insurance subsidiaries of ge life which funded two collateral trusts with securities presently as discussed below the trusts are referred to as the genworth trusts 

as part of ge’s spinoff of genworth in 2004 ge retained the risks and rewards associated with the 2000 travelers reinsurance agreement by providing a reinsurance contract to genworth through ge’s union fidelity life insurance company uflic subsidiary that covers the travelers ltc policies in addition ge provided a capital maintenance agreement in favor of uflic that is designed to assure that uflic will have the funds to pay its reinsurance obligations as a result of these reinsurance agreements and the spinoff of genworth genworth has reinsurance protection from uflic supported by ge and has reinsurance obligations in connection with the travelers ltc policies as noted below the genworth reinsurance obligations now benefit brighthouse financial inc brighthouse while neither brighthouse nor citi are direct beneficiaries of the capital maintenance agreement between ge and uflic brighthouse and citi benefit indirectly from the existence of the capital maintenance agreement which helps assure that uflic will continue to have funds necessary to pay its reinsurance obligations to genworth 

in connection with citi’s 2005 sale of travelers to metlife inc metlife citi provided an indemnification to metlife for losses including policyholder claims relating to the ltc business for the entire term of the travelers ltc policies which as noted above are reinsured by subsidiaries of genworth in 2017 metlife spun off its retail insurance business to brighthouse as a result the travelers ltc policies now reside with brighthouse the original reinsurance agreement between travelers now brighthouse and genworth remains in place and brighthouse is the sole beneficiary of the genworth trusts the genworth trusts are designed to provide collateral to brighthouse in an amount equal to the statutory liabilities of brighthouse in respect of the travelers ltc policies the assets in the genworth trusts are evaluated and adjusted periodically to ensure that the fair value of the assets continues to provide collateral in an amount equal to these estimated statutory liabilities as the liabilities change over time 

if both i genworth fails to perform under the original travelersge life reinsurance agreement for any reason including its insolvency or the failure of uflic to perform under its reinsurance contract or ge to perform under the capital maintenance agreement and ii the assets of the two genworth trusts are insufficient or unavailable then citi through its ltc reinsurance indemnification must reimburse brighthouse for any losses incurred in connection with the ltc policies since both events would have to occur before citi would become responsible for any payment to brighthouse pursuant to its indemnification obligation and the likelihood of such events occurring is currently not probable there is no liability reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2021 and 2020 related to this indemnification however if both events become reasonably possible meaning more than remote but less than probable citi will be required to estimate and disclose a reasonably possible loss or range of loss to the extent that such an estimate could be made in addition if both events become probable citi will be required to accrue for such liability in accordance with applicable accounting principles 

futures and overthecounter derivatives clearing 

citi provides clearing services on central clearing parties ccp for clients that need to clear exchangetraded and overthecounter otc derivatives contracts with ccps based on all relevant facts and circumstances citi has concluded that it acts as an agent for accounting purposes in its role as clearing member for these client transactions as such citi does not reflect the underlying exchangetraded or otc derivatives contracts in its consolidated financial statements see note 22 for a discussion of citi’s derivatives activities that are reflected in its consolidated financial statements 

as a clearing member citi collects and remits cash and securities collateral margin between its clients and the respective ccp in certain circumstances citi collects a higher amount of cash or securities from its clients than it needs to remit to the ccps this excess cash is then held at depository institutions such as banks or carry brokers 

there are two types of margin initial and variation where citi obtains benefits from or controls cash initial margin eg retains an interest spread cash initial margin 

collected from clients and remitted to the ccp or depository institutions is reflected within brokerage payables payables to customers and brokerage receivables receivables from brokers dealers and clearing organizations or cash and due from banks  respectively 

however for exchangetraded and otccleared derivatives contracts where citi does not obtain benefits from or control the client cash balances the client cash initial margin collected from clients and remitted to the ccp or depository institutions is not reflected on citi’s consolidated balance sheet these conditions are met when citi has contractually agreed with the client that i citi will pass through to the client all interest paid by the ccp or depository institutions on the cash initial margin ii citi will not utilize its right as a clearing member to transform cash margin into other assets iii citi does not guarantee and is not liable to the client for the performance of the ccp or the depository institution and iv the client cash balances are legally isolated from citi’s bankruptcy estate the total amount of cash initial margin collected and remitted in this manner was approximately  187 billion and  166 billion as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively 

variation margin due from clients to the respective ccp or from the ccp to clients reflects changes in the value of the client’s derivative contracts for each trading day as a clearing member citi is exposed to the risk of nonperformance by clients eg failure of a client to post variation margin to the ccp for negative changes in the value of the client’s derivative contracts in the event of nonperformance by a client citi would move to close out the client’s positions the ccp would typically utilize initial margin posted by the client and held by the ccp with any remaining shortfalls required to be paid by citi as clearing member citi generally holds incremental cash or securities margin posted by the client which would typically be expected to be sufficient to mitigate citi’s credit risk in the event that the client fails to perform

performance risk 

citi evaluates the performance risk of its guarantees based on the assigned referenced counterparty internal or external ratings where external ratings are used investmentgrade ratings are considered to be baabbb and above while anything below is considered noninvestment grade citi’s internal ratings are in line with the related external rating system on certain underlying referenced assets or entities ratings are not available such referenced assets are included in the “not rated” category the maximum potential amount of the future payments related to the outstanding guarantees is determined to be the notional amount of these contracts which is the par amount of the assets guaranteed 

presented in the tables below are the maximum potential amounts of future payments that are classified based on internal and external credit ratings the determination of the maximum potential future payments is based on the notional amount of the guarantees without consideration of possible recoveries under recourse provisions or from collateral held or pledged as such citi believes such amounts bear no relationship to the anticipated losses if any on these guarantees

27 contingencies 

accounting and disclosure framework 

asc 450 governs the disclosure and recognition of loss contingencies including potential losses from litigation regulatory tax and other matters asc 450 defines a “loss contingency” as “an existing condition situation or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss to an entity that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur” it imposes different requirements for the recognition and disclosure of loss contingencies based on the likelihood of occurrence of the contingent future event or events it distinguishes among degrees of likelihood using the following three terms “probable” meaning that “the future event or events are likely to occur” “remote” meaning that “the chance of the future event or events occurring is slight” and “reasonably possible” meaning that “the chance of the future event or events occurring is more than remote but less than likely” these three terms are used below as defined in asc 450 

accruals  asc 450 requires accrual for a loss contingency when it is “probable that one or more future events will occur confirming the fact of loss” and “the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated” in accordance with asc 450 citigroup establishes accruals for contingencies including any litigation regulatory or tax matters disclosed herein when citigroup believes it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated when the reasonable estimate of the loss is within a range of amounts the minimum amount of the range is accrued unless some higher amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range once established accruals are adjusted from time to time as appropriate in light of additional information the amount of loss ultimately incurred in relation to those matters may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts accrued for those matters 

disclosure  asc 450 requires disclosure of a loss contingency if “there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may have been incurred” and there is no accrual for the loss because the conditions described above are not met or an exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount accrued in accordance with asc 450 if citigroup has not accrued for a matter because citigroup believes that a loss is reasonably possible but not probable or that a loss is probable but not reasonably estimable and the reasonably possible loss is material it discloses the loss contingency in addition citigroup discloses matters for which it has accrued if it believes a reasonably possible exposure to material loss exists in excess of the amount accrued in accordance with asc 450 citigroup’s disclosure includes an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss for those matters as to which an estimate can be made asc 450 does not require disclosure of an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss where an estimate cannot be made neither accrual nor disclosure is required for losses that are deemed remote 

litigation regulatory and other contingencies 

overview in addition to the matters described below in the ordinary course of business citigroup its affiliates and subsidiaries and current and former officers directors and employees for purposes of this section sometimes collectively referred to as citigroup and related parties routinely are named as defendants in or as parties to various legal actions and proceedings certain of these actions and proceedings assert claims or seek relief in connection with alleged violations of consumer protection fair lending securities banking antifraud antitrust antimoney laundering employment and other statutory and common laws certain of these actual or threatened legal actions and proceedings include claims for substantial or indeterminate compensatory or punitive damages or for injunctive relief and in some instances seek recovery on a classwide basis 

in the ordinary course of business citigroup and related parties also are subject to governmental and regulatory examinations informationgathering requests investigations and proceedings both formal and informal certain of which may result in adverse judgments settlements fines penalties restitution disgorgement injunctions or other relief in addition certain affiliates and subsidiaries of citigroup are banks registered brokerdealers futures commission merchants investment advisors or other regulated entities and in those capacities are subject to regulation by various us state and foreign securities banking commodity futures consumer protection and other regulators in connection with formal and informal inquiries by these regulators citigroup and such affiliates and subsidiaries receive numerous requests subpoenas and orders seeking documents testimony and other information in connection with various aspects of their regulated activities from time to time citigroup and related parties also receive grand jury subpoenas and other requests for information or assistance formal or informal from federal or state law enforcement agencies including among others various united states attorneys’ offices the asset forfeiture and money laundering section and other divisions of the department of justice the financial crimes enforcement network of the united states department of the treasury and the federal bureau of investigation relating to citigroup and its customers 

because of the global scope of citigroup’s operations and its presence in countries around the world citigroup and related parties are subject to litigation and governmental and regulatory examinations informationgathering requests investigations and proceedings both formal and informal in multiple jurisdictions with legal regulatory and tax regimes that may differ substantially and present substantially different risks from those citigroup and related parties are subject to in the united states in some instances citigroup and related parties may be involved in proceedings involving the same subject matter in multiple jurisdictions which may result in overlapping cumulative or inconsistent outcomes 

citigroup seeks to resolve all litigation regulatory tax and other matters in the manner management believes is in the best interests of citigroup and its shareholders and contests liability allegations of wrongdoing and where applicable the amount of damages or scope of any penalties or other relief sought as appropriate in each pending matter 

inherent uncertainty of the matters disclosed certain of the matters disclosed below involve claims for substantial or indeterminate damages the claims asserted in these matters typically are broad often spanning a multiyear period and sometimes a wide range of business activities and the plaintiffs’ or claimants’ alleged damages frequently are not quantified or factually supported in the complaint or statement of claim other matters relate to regulatory investigations or proceedings as to which there may be no objective basis for quantifying the range of potential fine penalty or other remedy as a result citigroup is often unable to estimate the loss in such matters even if it believes that a loss is probable or reasonably possible until developments in the case proceeding or investigation have yielded additional information sufficient to support a quantitative assessment of the range of reasonably possible loss such developments may include among other things discovery from adverse parties or third parties rulings by the court on key issues analysis by retained experts and engagement in settlement negotiations depending on a range of factors such as the complexity of the facts the novelty of the legal theories the pace of discovery the court’s scheduling order the timing of court decisions and the adverse party’s regulator’s or other authority’s willingness to negotiate in good faith toward a resolution it may be months or years after the filing of a case or commencement of a proceeding or an investigation before an estimate of the range of reasonably possible loss can be made 

matters as to which an estimate can be made  for some of the matters disclosed below citigroup is currently able to estimate a reasonably possible loss or range of loss in excess of amounts accrued if any for some of the matters included within this estimation an accrual has been made because a loss is believed to be both probable and reasonably estimable but an exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount accrued in these cases the estimate reflects the reasonably possible range of loss in excess of the accrued amount for other matters included within this estimation no accrual has been made because a loss although estimable is believed to be reasonably possible but not probable in these cases the estimate reflects the reasonably possible loss or range of loss as of december 31 2021 citigroup estimates that the reasonably possible unaccrued loss for these matters ranges up to approximately  15 billion in the aggregate 

these estimates are based on currently available information as available information changes the matters for which citigroup is able to estimate will change and the estimates themselves will change in addition while many estimates presented in financial statements and other financial disclosures involve significant judgment and may be subject to significant uncertainty estimates of the range of reasonably possible loss arising from litigation regulatory and tax proceedings are subject to particular uncertainties for example at the time of making an estimate i citigroup may have only preliminary incomplete or inaccurate information about the facts underlying the claim ii its assumptions about the future rulings of the court other tribunal or authority on significant issues or the behavior and incentives of adverse parties regulators or other authorities may prove to be wrong and iii the outcomes it is attempting to predict are often not amenable to the use of statistical or other quantitative 

analytical tools in addition from time to time an outcome may occur that citigroup had not accounted for in its estimate because it had deemed such an outcome to be remote for all of these reasons the amount of loss in excess of amounts accrued in relation to matters for which an estimate has been made could be substantially higher or lower than the range of loss included in the estimate 

matters as to which an estimate cannot be made  for other matters disclosed below citigroup is not currently able to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss many of these matters remain in very preliminary stages even in some cases where a substantial period of time has passed since the commencement of the matter with few or no substantive legal decisions by the court tribunal or other authority defining the scope of the claims the class if any or the potentially available damages or other exposure and fact discovery is still in progress or has not yet begun in many of these matters citigroup has not yet answered the complaint or statement of claim or asserted its defenses nor has it engaged in any negotiations with the adverse party whether a regulator taxing authority or a private party for all these reasons citigroup cannot at this time estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss if any for these matters 

opinion of management as to eventual outcome subject to the foregoing it is the opinion of citigroup’s management based on current knowledge and after taking into account its current accruals that the eventual outcome of all matters described in this note would not likely have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition of citigroup nonetheless given the substantial or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and the inherent unpredictability of such matters an adverse outcome in certain of these matters could from time to time have a material adverse effect on citigroup’s consolidated results of operations or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods

credit risk 

overview 

credit risk is the risk of loss resulting from the decline in credit quality or the failure of a borrower counterparty third party or issuer to honor its financial or contractual obligations credit risk arises in many of citigroup’s business activities including 

 

credit risk also arises from settlement and clearing activities when citi transfers an asset in advance of receiving its countervalue or advances funds to settle a transaction on behalf of a client concentration risk within credit risk is the risk associated with having credit exposure concentrated within a specific client industry region or other category 

credit risk is one of the most significant risks citi faces as an institution for additional information see “risk factors—credit risk” above as a result citi has a wellestablished framework in place for managing credit risk across all businesses this includes a defined risk appetite credit limits and credit policies both at the business level as well as at the companywide level citi’s credit risk management also includes processes and policies with respect to problem recognition including “watch lists” portfolio reviews stress tests updated risk ratings and classification triggers 

with respect to citi’s settlement and clearing activities intraday client usage of lines is monitored against limits as well as against usage patterns to the extent that a problem develops citi typically moves the client to a secured collateralized operating model generally citi’s intraday settlement and clearing lines are uncommitted and cancelable at any time 

to manage concentration of risk within credit risk citi has in place a correlation framework consisting of industry limits an idiosyncratic framework consisting of single name concentrations for each business and across citigroup and a specialized framework consisting of product limits 

credit exposures are generally reported in notional terms for accrual loans reflecting the value at which the loans as well as loan and other offbalance sheet commitments are carried on the consolidated balance sheet credit exposure arising from capital markets activities is generally expressed as the current marktomarket net of margin reflecting the net value owed to citi by a given counterparty 

the credit risk associated with these credit exposures is a function of the idiosyncratic creditworthiness of the obligor as well as the terms and conditions of the specific obligation citi assesses the credit risk associated with its credit exposures on a regular basis through its loan loss reserve process see “significant accounting policies and significant estimates—allowance for credit losses” below and notes 1 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements as well as through regular 

 

stress testing at the company business geography and product levels these stresstesting processes typically estimate potential incremental credit costs that would occur as a result of either downgrades in the credit quality or defaults of the obligors or counterparties

portfolio mix—geography counterparty and industry 

citi’s corporate credit portfolio is diverse by geography and counterparty the following table shows the regional percentages of this portfolio based on citi’s internal management geography 



the maintenance of accurate and consistent risk ratings across the corporate credit portfolio facilitates the comparison of credit exposure across all lines of business geographic regions and products counterparty risk ratings reflect an estimated probability of default for a counterparty and are derived by leveraging validated statistical models scorecard models and external agency ratings under defined circumstances in combination with consideration of factors specific to the obligor or market such as management experience competitive position and regulatory environment 

 

and commodity prices facility risk ratings are assigned that reflect the probability of default of the obligor and factors that affect the loss given default of the facility such as support or collateral internal obligor ratings that generally correspond to 

bbb and above are considered investment grade while those below are considered noninvestment grade 

citigroup has also incorporated environmental factors such as climate risk assessment and reporting criteria for certain obligors as necessary factors evaluated include consideration of climate risk to an obligor’s business and physical assets and when relevant consideration of costeffective options to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 

the following table presents the corporate credit portfolio by facility risk rating as a percentage of the total corporate credit portfolio 



note total exposure includes direct outstandings and unfunded lending commitments 

citi’s corporate credit portfolio is also diversified by industry the following table shows the allocation of citi’s total corporate credit portfolio by industry 



for additional information on citi’s corporate credit portfolio see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements 

credit risk mitigation 

as part of its overall risk management activities citigroup uses credit derivatives and other risk mitigants to hedge portions of the credit risk in its corporate credit portfolio in addition to outright asset sales citi may enter into partialterm hedges as well as fullterm hedges in advance of the expiration of partialterm hedges citi will determine among other factors the economic feasibility of hedging the remaining life of the instrument the results of the marktomarket and any realized gains or losses on credit derivatives are reflected primarily in principal transactions in the consolidated statement of income 

at december 31 2019  september 30 2019 and december 31 2018  citigroup had economic hedges in place on the corporate credit portfolio of 352 billion 295 billion and 302 billion respectively citigroup’s expected loss model used in the calculation of its loan loss reserve does not include the favorable impact of credit derivatives and other mitigants that are marked to market in addition the reported amounts of direct outstandings and unfunded lending commitments in the tables above do not reflect the impact of these hedging transactions the credit protection was economically hedging underlying corporate credit portfolio exposures with the following risk rating distribution

liquidity risk 

overview 

adequate and diverse sources of funding and liquidity are essential to citi’s businesses funding and liquidity risks arise from several factors many of which are mostly or entirely outside citi’s control such as disruptions in the financial markets changes in key funding sources credit spreads changes in citi’s credit ratings and macroeconomic geopolitical and other conditions for additional information see “risk factors” above 

citi’s funding and liquidity management objectives are aimed at i funding its existing asset base ii growing its core businesses iii maintaining sufficient liquidity structured appropriately so that citi can operate under a variety of adverse circumstances including potential companyspecific andor market liquidity events in varying durations and severity and iv satisfying regulatory requirements including among other things those related to resolution planning for additional information see “resolution plan” and “total lossabsorbing capacity tlac” below citigroup’s primary liquidity objectives are established by entity and in aggregate across two major categories 

  

 

at an aggregate citigroup level citi’s goal is to maintain sufficient funding in amount and tenor to fully fund customer assets and to provide an appropriate amount of cash and highquality liquid assets as discussed below even in times of stress in order to meet its payment obligations as they come due the liquidity risk management framework provides that in addition to the aggregate requirements certain entities be selfsufficient or net providers of liquidity including in conditions established under their designated stress tests 

citi’s primary sources of funding include i deposits via citi’s bank subsidiaries which are citi’s most stable and lowest cost source of longterm funding ii longterm debt primarily senior and subordinated debt primarily issued at the parent and certain bank subsidiaries and iii stockholders’ equity these sources may be supplemented by shortterm borrowings primarily in the form of secured funding transactions 

 

as referenced above citi’s funding and liquidity framework ensures that the tenor of these funding sources is of sufficient term in relation to the tenor of its asset base the goal of citi’s assetliability management is to ensure that there is excess liquidity and tenor in the liability structure relative to the liquidity profile of the assets this reduces the risk that liabilities will become due before assets mature or are monetized this excess liquidity is held primarily in the form of highquality liquid assets hqla as set forth in the table below 

citi’s liquidity is managed via a centralized treasury model by treasury in conjunction with regional and incountry treasurers with independent oversight provided by independent risk management pursuant to this approach citi’s hqla are managed with emphasis on assetliability management and entitylevel liquidity adequacy throughout citi 

the chief risk officer and citi’s cfo cochair citi’s asset liability management committee alco which includes citi’s treasurer and other senior executives alco among other things sets the strategy of the liquidity portfolio and monitors its performance significant changes to portfolio asset allocations need to be approved by alco 

liquidity monitoring and measurement 

stress testing 

liquidity stress testing is performed for each of citi’s major entities operating subsidiaries andor countries stress testing and scenario analyses are intended to quantify the potential impact of an adverse liquidity event on the balance sheet and liquidity position and to identify viable funding alternatives that can be utilized these scenarios include assumptions about significant changes in key funding sources market triggers such as credit ratings potential uses of funding and macroeconomic geopolitical and other conditions these conditions include expected and stressed market conditions as well as companyspecific events 

liquidity stress tests are performed to ascertain potential mismatches between liquidity sources and uses over a variety of time horizons and over different stressed conditions liquidity limits are set accordingly to monitor the liquidity of an entity these stress tests and potential mismatches are calculated with varying frequencies with several tests performed daily 

given the range of potential stresses citi maintains contingency funding plans on a consolidated basis and for individual entities these plans specify a wide range of readily available actions for a variety of adverse market conditions or idiosyncratic stresses 

highquality liquid assets hqla 



note the amounts set forth in the table above are presented on an average basis for securities the amounts represent the liquidity value that potentially could be realized and therefore exclude any securities that are encumbered and incorporate any haircuts that would be required for securities financing transactions the table above incorporates various restrictions that could limit the transferability of liquidity between legal entities including section 23a of the federal reserve act 

 

the table above includes average amounts of hqla held at citigroup’s operating entities that are eligible for inclusion in the calculation of citigroup’s consolidated liquidity coverage ratio lcr pursuant to the us lcr rules these amounts include the hqla needed to meet the minimum requirements at these entities and any amounts in excess of these minimums that are assumed to be transferable to other entities within citigroup citigroup’s hqla increased sequentially reflecting deposit growth and the issuance of longterm debt 

citi’s hqla as set forth above does not include citi’s available borrowing capacity from the federal home loan banks fhlbs of which citi is a member which was approximately 35 billion as of december 31 2019 compared to 40 billion as of september 30 2019 and 29 billion as of december 31 2018 and maintained by eligible collateral pledged to such banks the hqla also does not include citi’s borrowing capacity at the us federal reserve bank discount window or other central banks which would be in addition to the resources noted above 

 

shortterm liquidity measurement liquidity coverage ratio lcr 

in addition to internal 30day liquidity stress testing performed for citi’s major entities operating subsidiaries and countries citi also monitors its liquidity by reference to the lcr 

generally the lcr is designed to ensure that banks maintain an adequate level of hqla to meet liquidity needs under an acute 30day stress scenario the lcr is calculated by dividing hqla by estimated net outflows over a stressed 30day period with the net outflows determined by applying prescribed outflow factors to various categories of liabilities such as deposits unsecured and secured wholesale borrowings unused lending commitments and derivativesrelated exposures partially offset by inflows from assets maturing within 30 days banks are required to calculate an addon to address potential maturity mismatches between contractual cash outflows and inflows within the 30day period in determining the total amount of net outflows the minimum lcr requirement is 100 

the table below details the components of citi’s lcr calculation and hqla in excess of net outflows for the periods indicated 



note the amounts are presented on an average basis 

citi’s average lcr increased sequentially reflecting the issuance of longterm debt 

longterm liquidity measurement net stable funding ratio nsfr 

in 2016 the federal reserve board the fdic and the occ issued a proposed rule to implement the basel iii nsfr requirement 

the usproposed nsfr is largely consistent with the basel committee’s final nsfr rules in general the nsfr assesses the availability of a bank’s stable funding against a required level a bank’s available stable funding would include portions of equity deposits and longterm debt while its required stable funding would be based on the liquidity characteristics and encumbrance period of its assets derivatives and commitments prescribed factors would be required to be applied to the various categories of asset and liabilities classes the ratio of available stable funding to required stable funding would be required to be greater than 100 

while citi believes that it is compliant with the proposed us nsfr rules as of december 31 2019 it will need to evaluate a final version of the rules citi expects that the nsfr final rules implementation period will be communicated along with the final version of the rules 

loans 

as part of its funding and liquidity objectives citi seeks to fund its existing asset base appropriately as well as maintain sufficient liquidity to grow its gcb and icg businesses including its loan portfolio citi maintains a diversified portfolio of loans to its consumer and institutional clients the table below details the average loans by business andor segment and the total endofperiod loans for each of the periods indicated

in icg  deposits increased 10 primarily driven by highquality deposit growth in tts 

longterm debt 

longterm debt generally defined as debt with original maturities of one year or more represents the most significant component of citi’s funding for the citigroup parent company and citi’s nonbank subsidiaries and is a supplementary source of funding for the bank entities 

longterm debt is an important funding source due in part to its multiyear contractual maturity structure the weightedaverage maturity of unsecured longterm debt issued by citigroup and its affiliates including citibank with a remaining life greater than one year was approximately 84 years as of december 31 2019  unchanged from september 30 2019 and a slight decline from the prior year the weightedaverage maturity is calculated based on the contractual maturity of each security for securities that are redeemable prior to maturity at the option of the holder the weightedaverage maturity is calculated based on the earliest date an option becomes exercisable 

citi’s longterm debt outstanding at the citigroup parent company includes benchmark senior and subordinated debt and what citi refers to as customerrelated debt consisting of structured notes such as equity and creditlinked notes as well as nonstructured notes citi’s issuance of customerrelated debt is generally driven by customer demand and supplements benchmark debt issuance as a source of funding for citi’s nonbank entities citi’s longterm debt at the bank includes benchmark senior debt fhlb advances and securitizations 

 

longterm debt outstanding 

the following table sets forth citi’s endofperiod total longterm debt outstanding for each of the dates indicated 



note amounts represent the current value of longterm debt on citi’s consolidated balance sheet which for certain debt instruments includes consideration of fair value hedging impacts and unamortized discounts and premiums 

 

citi’s total longterm debt outstanding increased both yearoveryear and quarteroverquarter largely driven by an increase in customerrelated debt at the nonbank entities yearoveryear this growth was partially offset by a decline in securitizations at the bank 

as part of its liability management citi has considered and may continue to consider opportunities to repurchase its longterm debt pursuant to open market purchases tender offers or other means such repurchases help reduce citi’s overall funding costs during 2019 citi repurchased 131 billion of its outstanding longterm debt including early redemptions of fhlb advances but excluding the exercise of call options on 40 billion of securities with a remaining life of three months or less 

longterm debt issuances and maturities 

the table below details citi’s longterm debt issuances and maturities including repurchases and redemptions during the periods presented 



the table below shows citi’s aggregate longterm debt maturities including repurchases and redemptions in 2019  as well as its aggregate expected annual longterm debt maturities as of december 31 2019  

resolution plan 

citi is required under title i of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 doddfrank act and the rules promulgated by the fdic and frb to periodically submit a plan for citi’s rapid and orderly resolution under the us bankruptcy code in the event of material financial distress or failure for additional information on citi’s resolution plan submissions see “risk factors—strategic risks” above citigroup’s preferred resolution strategy is “single point of entry” under the us bankruptcy code 

under citi’s resolution plan only citigroup the parent holding company would enter into bankruptcy while citigroup’s material legal entities as defined in the public section of its 2019 resolution plan which can be found on the frb’s and fdic’s websites would remain operational and outside of any resolution or insolvency proceedings citigroup’s resolution plan has been designed to minimize the risk of systemic impact to the us and global financial systems while maximizing the value of the bankruptcy estate for the benefit of citigroup’s creditors including its unsecured longterm debt holders in addition in line with the federal reserve’s final total lossabsorbing capacity tlac rule citigroup believes it has developed the resolution plan so that citigroup’s shareholders and unsecured creditors—including its unsecured longterm debt holders—bear any losses resulting from citigroup’s bankruptcy accordingly any value realized by holders of its unsecured longterm debt may not be sufficient to repay the amounts owed to such debt holders in the event of a bankruptcy or other resolution proceeding of citigroup 

the fdic has also indicated that it was developing a single point of entry strategy to implement its resolution authority under title ii of the doddfrank act 

as previously disclosed in response to feedback received from the federal reserve and fdic citigroup took the following actions 

 



 

other things meet citigroup’s nearterm cash needs 

 

 

the citi support agreement provides two mechanisms besides citicorp’s issuing of dividends to citigroup pursuant to which citicorp will be required to transfer cash to citigroup during business as usual so that citigroup can fund its debt service as well as other operating needs i one or more funding notes issued by citicorp to citigroup and ii a committed line of credit under which citicorp may make loans to citigroup 

on december 17 2019 the frb and fdic issued feedback on the resolution plans filed on july 1 2019 by the eight us gsibs including citi the frb and fdic identified one shortcoming but no deficiencies in citi’s resolution plan relating to governance mechanisms citi is required to submit a plan to address the shortcoming by march 31 2020 which the frb and fdic will take into account in determining the scope of citi’s targeted resolution plan due on july 1 2021 

total lossabsorbing capacity tlac 

in 2016 the federal reserve board imposed minimum external tlac and longterm debt ltd requirements on us global systemically important bank holding companies gsibs including citi effective as of january 1 2019 as a result us gsibs are required to maintain minimum levels of tlac and eligible ltd each set by reference to the gsib’s consolidated riskweighted assets rwa and total leverage exposure as described further below the intended purpose of the requirements is to facilitate the orderly resolution of us gsibs under the us bankruptcy code and title ii of the doddfrank act for additional information including citi’s tlac and ltd amounts and ratios see “capital resources— current regulatory capital standards” and “risk factors—compliance risks” above 

minimum tlac requirements 

the minimum tlac requirement is the greater of i 18 of the gsib’s rwa plus the thenapplicable rwabased tlac buffer see below and ii 75 of the gsib’s total leverage exposure plus a leveragedbased tlac buffer of 2 ie 95 

the rwabased tlac buffer equals the 25 capital conservation buffer plus any applicable countercyclical capital buffer currently 0 plus the gsib’s capital surcharge as determined under method 1 of the gsib surcharge rule 20 for citi for 2020 accordingly citi’s total current minimum tlac requirement is 225 of rwa for 2020 

as of december 31 2019 citi exceeded each of the minimum tlac requirements with ratios of 115 of tlac 

as a percentage of total leverage exposure and 247 of tlac as a percentage of standardized approach rwa 

minimum eligible ltd requirements 

the minimum ltd requirement is the greater of i 6 of the gsib’s rwa plus its capital surcharge as determined under method 2 of the gsib surcharge rule 30 for citi for 2020 for a total current requirement of 9 of rwa for citi and ii 45 of the gsib’s total leverage exposure 

as of december 31 2019 citi exceeded each of the minimum ltd requirements with ratios of 109 of ltd as a percentage of standardized approach rwa and 51 of ltd as a percentage of total leverage exposure 

for additional discussion of the method 1 and method 2 gsib capital surcharge methodologies see “capital resources—current regulatory capital standards” above 

secured funding transactions and shortterm borrowings 

citi supplements its primary sources of funding with shortterm financings that generally include i secured funding transactions consisting of securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase or repos and ii to a lesser extent shortterm borrowings consisting of commercial paper and borrowings from the fhlb and other market participants 

secured funding transactions 

secured funding is primarily accessed through citi’s brokerdealer subsidiaries to fund efficiently both i secured lending activity and ii a portion of the securities inventory held in the context of market making and customer activities citi also executes a smaller portion of its secured funding transactions through its bank entities which are typically collateralized by government debt securities generally daily changes in the level of citi’s secured funding are primarily due to fluctuations in secured lending activity in the matched book as described below and securities inventory 

secured funding of 166 billion as of december 31 2019 decreased 6 from the prior year and 15 from the prior quarter excluding the impact of fx translation secured funding decreased 7 from the prior year and 17 from the prior quarter both driven by normal business activity average balances for secured funding were 188 billion for the quarter ended december 31 2019  

the portion of secured funding in the brokerdealer subsidiaries that funds secured lending is commonly referred to as “matched book” activity the majority of this activity is secured by highquality liquid securities such as us treasury securities us agency securities and foreign government debt securities other secured funding is secured by less liquid securities including equity securities corporate bonds and assetbacked securities the tenor of which is generally equal to or longer than the tenor of the corresponding matched book assets 

 

the remainder of the secured funding activity in the brokerdealer subsidiaries serves to fund securities inventory held in the context of market making and customer activities to maintain reliable funding under a wide range of market conditions including under periods of stress citi manages these activities by taking into consideration the quality of the underlying collateral and establishing minimum required funding tenors the weighted average maturity of citi’s secured funding of less liquid securities inventory was greater than 110 days as of december 31 2019  

citi manages the risks in its secured funding by conducting daily stress tests to account for changes in capacity tenors haircut collateral profile and client actions in addition citi maintains counterparty diversification by establishing concentration triggers and assessing counterparty reliability and stability under stress citi generally sources secured funding from more than 150 counterparties 

shortterm borrowings 

citi’s shortterm borrowings of 45 billion increased 39 yearoveryear and 28 sequentially primarily driven by an increase in fhlb advances as well as commercial paper issued out of the brokerdealer entities see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on citigroup’s and its affiliates’ outstanding shortterm borrowings 

overall shortterm borrowings 

the following table contains the yearend average and maximum monthend amounts for the following respective shortterm borrowings categories at the end of each of the three prior years 



 

credit ratings 

citigroup’s funding and liquidity funding capacity ability to access capital markets and other sources of funds the cost of these funds and its ability to maintain certain deposits are partially dependent on its credit ratings 

the table below shows the ratings for citigroup and citibank as of december 31 2019 while not included in the table below the longterm and shortterm ratings of citigroup global markets holding inc cgmhi were bbba2 at standard  poor’s and af1 at fitch as of december 31 2019  

ratings as of december 31 2019 

potential impacts of ratings downgrades 

ratings downgrades by moody’s fitch or sp could negatively impact citigroup’s andor citibank’s funding and liquidity due to reduced funding capacity including derivative triggers which could take the form of cash obligations and collateral requirements 

the following information is provided for the purpose of analyzing the potential funding and liquidity impact to citigroup and citibank of a hypothetical simultaneous 

ratings downgrade across all three major rating agencies this analysis is subject to certain estimates estimation methodologies judgments and uncertainties uncertainties include potential ratings limitations that certain entities may have with respect to permissible counterparties as well as general subjective counterparty behavior for example certain corporate customers and markets counterparties could reevaluate their business relationships with citi and limit transactions in certain contracts or market instruments with citi changes in counterparty behavior could impact citi’s funding and liquidity as well as the results of operations of certain of its businesses the actual impact to citigroup or citibank is unpredictable and may differ materially from the potential funding and liquidity impacts described below for additional information on the impact of credit rating changes on citi and its applicable subsidiaries see “risk factors—liquidity risks” above 

citigroup inc and citibank—potential derivative triggers 

as of december 31 2019  citi estimates that a hypothetical onenotch downgrade of the senior debtlongterm rating of citigroup inc across all three major rating agencies could impact citigroup’s funding and liquidity due to derivative triggers by approximately 05 billion compared to 03 billion as of september 30 2019  other funding sources such as secured financing transactions and other margin requirements for which there are no explicit triggers could also be adversely affected 

 

as of december 31 2019  citi estimates that a hypothetical onenotch downgrade of the senior debtlongterm rating of citibank across all three major rating agencies could impact citibank’s funding and liquidity by approximately 03 billion compared to 07 billion as of september 30 2019  

in total as of december 31 2019  citi estimates that a onenotch downgrade of citigroup and citibank across all three major rating agencies could result in increased aggregate cash obligations and collateral requirements of approximately 08 billion compared to 10 billion as of september 30 2019 see also note 22 to the consolidated financial statements as detailed under “highquality liquid assets” above the liquidity resources that are eligible for inclusion in the calculation of citi’s consolidated hqla were approximately 385 billion for citibank and 53 billion for citi’s nonbank and other entities for a total of approximately 438 billion as of december 31 2019  these liquidity resources are available in part as a contingency for the potential events described above 

in addition a broad range of mitigating actions are currently included in citigroup’s and citibank’s contingency funding plans for citigroup these mitigating factors include but are not limited to accessing surplus funding capacity from existing clients tailoring levels of secured lending and adjusting the size of select trading books and collateralized borrowings from certain citibank subsidiaries mitigating actions available to citibank include but are not limited to selling or financing highly liquid government securities tailoring levels of secured lending adjusting the size of select trading assets reducing loan originations and renewals raising additional deposits or borrowing from the fhlb or central banks citi believes these mitigating actions could substantially reduce the funding and liquidity risk if any of the potential downgrades described above 

citibank—additional potential impacts 

in addition to the above derivative triggers citi believes that a potential downgrade of citibank’s senior debtlongterm rating across any of the three major rating agencies could also have an adverse impact on the commercial papershortterm rating of citibank as of december 31 2019  citibank had liquidity commitments of approximately 102 billion to consolidated assetbacked commercial paper conduits compared to 100 billion as of september 30 2019 as referenced in note 21 to the consolidated financial statements 

in addition to the abovereferenced liquidity resources of certain citibank entities citibank could reduce the funding and liquidity risk if any of the potential downgrades described above through mitigating actions including repricing or reducing certain commitments to commercial paper conduits in the event of the potential downgrades described above citi believes that certain corporate customers could reevaluate their deposit relationships with citibank this reevaluation could result in clients adjusting their discretionary deposit levels or changing their depository institution which could potentially reduce certain deposit levels at citibank however citi could choose to adjust pricing offer alternative deposit products to its existing customers or seek to attract deposits from new customers in addition to the mitigating actions referenced above 

market risk 

overview 

market risk is the potential for losses arising from changes in the value of citi’s assets and liabilities resulting from changes in market variables such as interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices commodity prices and credit spreads as well as their implied volatilities market risk emanates from both citi’s trading and nontrading portfolios for additional information on market risk see “risk factors” above 

each business is required to establish with approval from citi’s market risk management a market risk limit framework for identified risk factors that clearly defines approved risk profiles and is within the parameters of citi’s overall risk appetite these limits are monitored by the risk organization citi’s country and business asset and liability committees and the citigroup asset and liability committee in all cases the businesses are ultimately responsible for the market risks taken and for remaining within their defined limits 

market risk of nontrading portfolios 

market risk from nontrading portfolios stems from the potential impact of changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates on citi’s net interest revenues the changes in accumulated other comprehensive income loss aoci from its debt securities portfolios and capital invested in foreign currencies 

net interest revenue at risk 

net interest revenue for interest rate exposure purposes is the difference between the yield earned on the nontrading portfolio assets including customer loans and the rate paid on the liabilities including customer deposits or company borrowings net interest revenue is affected by changes in the level of interest rates as well as the amounts and mix of assets and liabilities and the timing of contractual and assumed repricing of assets and liabilities to reflect market rates 

citi’s principal measure of risk to net interest revenue is interest rate exposure ire ire measures the change in expected net interest revenue in each currency resulting solely from unanticipated changes in forward interest rates 

citi’s estimated ire incorporates various assumptions including prepayment rates on loans customer behavior and the impact of pricing decisions for example in rising interest rate scenarios portions of the deposit portfolio may be assumed to experience rate increases that are less than the change in market interest rates in declining interest rate scenarios it is assumed that mortgage portfolios experience higher prepayment rates citi’s estimated ire below assumes that its businesses andor citi treasury make no additional changes in balances or positioning in response to the unanticipated rate changes 

in order to manage changes in interest rates effectively citi may modify pricing on new customer loans and deposits purchase fixedrate securities issue debt that is either fixed or floating or enter into derivative transactions that have the opposite risk exposures citi regularly assesses the viability of these and other strategies to reduce its interest rate risks and 

 

implements such strategies when it believes those actions are prudent 

citi manages interest rate risk as a consolidated companywide position citi’s clientfacing businesses create interest ratesensitive positions including loans and deposits as part of their ongoing activities citi treasury aggregates these risk positions and manages them centrally operating within established limits citi treasury makes positioning decisions and uses tools such as citi’s investment securities portfolio companyissued debt and interest rate derivatives to target the desired risk profile changes in citi’s interest rate risk position reflect the accumulated changes in all nontrading assets and liabilities with potentially large and offsetting impacts as well as in citi treasury’s positioning decisions 

citigroup employs additional measurements including stress testing the impact of nonlinear interest rate movements on the value of the balance sheet and the analysis of portfolio duration and volatility particularly as they relate to mortgage loans and mortgagebacked securities and the potential impact of the change in the spread between different market indices 

interest rate risk of investment portfolios—impact 

on aoci 

citi also measures the potential impacts of changes in interest rates on the value of its aoci  which can in turn impact citi’s common equity and tangible common equity this will impact citi’s common equity tier 1 and other regulatory capital ratios citi’s goal is to benefit from an increase in the market level of interest rates while limiting the impact of changes in aoci on its regulatory capital position 

aoci at risk is managed as part of the companywide interest rate risk position aoci at risk considers potential changes in aoci and the corresponding impact on the common equity tier 1 capital ratio relative to citi’s capital generation capacity 

the following table sets forth the estimated impact to citi’s net interest revenue aoci and the common equity tier 1 capital ratio on a fully implemented basis each assuming an unanticipated parallel instantaneous 100 basis point bps increase in interest rates 



 

the yearoveryear decrease in the estimated impact to net interest revenue primarily reflected changes in citi’s balance sheet composition and citi treasury positioning the yearoveryear changes in the estimated impact to aoci and the common equity tier 1 capital ratio primarily reflected the impact of the composition of citi treasury’s investment and derivatives portfolio 

in the event of an unanticipated parallel instantaneous 100 bps increase in interest rates citi expects that the negative impact to aoci would be offset in shareholders’ equity through the combination of expected incremental net interest 

 

revenue and the expected recovery of the impact on aoci through accretion of citi’s investment portfolio over a period of time as of december 31 2019  citi expects that the negative 50 billion impact to aoci in such a scenario could potentially be offset over approximately 37 months 

the following table sets forth the estimated impact to citi’s net interest revenue aoci and the common equity tier 1 capital ratio on a fully implemented basis under five different changes in interest rate scenarios for the us dollar and citi’s other currencies 



note each scenario assumes that the rate change will occur instantaneously changes in interest rates for maturities between the overnight rate and the 10year rate are interpolated 

 

as shown in the table above the magnitude of the impact to citi’s net interest revenue and aoci is greater under scenario 2 as compared to scenario 3 this is because the combination of changes to citi’s investment portfolio partially offset by changes related to citi’s pension liabilities results in a net position that is more sensitive to rates at shorter and intermediateterm maturities 

changes in foreign exchange rates—impacts on aoci 

and capital 

as of december 31 2019  citi estimates that an unanticipated parallel instantaneous 5 appreciation of the us dollar against all of the other currencies in which citi has invested capital could reduce citi’s tangible common equity tce by approximately 15 billion or 1 as a result of changes to citi’s foreign currency translation adjustment in aoci  net of hedges this impact would be primarily due to changes in the value of the mexican peso euro australian dollar and indian rupee 

this impact is also before any mitigating actions citi may take including ongoing management of its foreign currency translation exposure specifically as currency movements change the value of citi’s net investments in foreign currencydenominated capital these movements also change the value of citi’s riskweighted assets denominated in those currencies this coupled with citi’s foreign currency hedging strategies such as foreign currency borrowings foreign currency forwards and other currency hedging instruments lessens the impact of foreign currency movements on citi’s common equity tier 1 capital ratio changes in these hedging strategies as well as hedging costs divestitures and tax impacts can further affect the actual impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on citi’s capital as compared to an unanticipated parallel shock as described above 

 

the effect of citi’s ongoing management strategies with respect to changes in foreign exchange rates and the impact of these changes on citi’s tce and common equity tier 1 capital ratio are shown in the table below for additional information on the changes in aoci  see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements 



 

interest revenueexpense and net interest margin nim 



note all interest expense amounts include fdic as well as other similar deposit insurance assessments outside of the us as of the fourth quarter of 2018 citi’s fdic surcharge was eliminated approximately 130 million per quarter 

 with any changes in fair value as part of principal transactions in the consolidated statement of income and is therefore not reflected in interest expense in the 

table above 

 

net interest revenue excluding icg markets 



 

citi’s net interest revenue in the fourth quarter of 2019 increased 1 to 120 billion also 120 billion on a taxable equivalent basis versus the prioryear period excluding the impact of fx translation net interest revenue also increased 1 or approximately 70 million as growth in icg markets fixed income markets and equity markets net interest revenue of 21 or 210 million was partially offset by a 1 decline or 150 million in net interest revenue exmarkets the increase in markets net interest revenue was driven by ongoing changes in the composition and mix of the business’s revenues between net interest revenue and noninterest revenue the decline in net interest revenue exmarkets was primarily due to the impact of lower interest rates partially offset by growth in the nonmarkets franchise citi’s nim was 263 on a taxable equivalent basis in the fourth quarter of 2019 an increase of 7 basis points bps from the prior quarter primarily driven by the higher markets net interest revenue partially offset by the impact of lower interest rates 

 

citi’s net interest revenue for the full year 2019 increased 2 to 473 billion 476 billion on a taxable equivalent basis versus the prior year excluding the impact of fx translation citi’s net interest revenue increased 3 or approximately 14 billion mainly reflecting strength in citibranded cards in north america gcb and treasury and trade solutions including the impact of volume growth as well as interest rates on a fullyear basis citi’s nim was 265 on a taxable equivalent basis compared to 269 in 2018 citi’s markets and nonmarkets net interest revenues are nongaap financial measures citi reviews nonmarkets net interest revenue to assess the performance of its lending investing and depositraising activities citi believes disclosure of this metric assists in providing a meaningful depiction of the underlying fundamentals of its nonmarkets businesses

market risk of trading portfolios 

trading portfolios include positions resulting from marketmaking activities hedges of certain availableforsale afs debt securities the cva relating to derivative counterparties and all associated hedges fair value option loans and hedges of the loan portfolio within capital markets origination within icg  

the market risk of citi’s trading portfolios is monitored using a combination of quantitative and qualitative measures including but not limited to 

 

each trading portfolio across citi’s businesses has its own market risk limit framework encompassing these measures and other controls including trading mandates new product 

 

approval permitted product lists and pretrade approval for larger more complex and less liquid transactions 

the following chart of total daily tradingrelated revenue loss captures trading volatility and shows the number of days in which revenues for citi’s trading businesses fell within particular ranges tradingrelated revenue includes trading net interest and other revenue associated with citi’s trading businesses it excludes dva fva and cva adjustments incurred due to changes in the credit quality of counterparties as well as any associated hedges of that cva in addition it excludes fees and other revenue associated with capital markets origination activities tradingrelated revenues are driven by both customer flows and the changes in valuation of the trading inventory as shown in the chart below positive tradingrelated revenue was achieved for 100 of the trading days in 2019 



 

factor sensitivities 

factor sensitivities are expressed as the change in the value of a position for a defined change in a market risk factor such as a change in the value of a us treasury bill for a onebasispoint change in interest rates citi’s market risk management within the risk organization works to ensure that factor sensitivities are calculated monitored and limited for all material risks taken in the trading portfolios 

value at risk var 

var estimates at a 99 confidence level the potential decline in the value of a position or a portfolio under normal market conditions assuming a oneday holding period var statistics which are based on historical data can be materially different across firms due to differences in portfolio composition differences in var methodologies and differences in model parameters as a result citi believes var statistics can be used more effectively as indicators of trends in risktaking within a firm rather than as a basis for inferring differences in risktaking across firms 

citi uses a single independently approved monte carlo simulation var model see “var model review and validation” below which has been designed to capture material risk sensitivities such as first and secondorder sensitivities of positions to changes in market prices of various asset classesrisk types such as interest rate credit 

 

spread foreign exchange equity and commodity risks citi’s var includes positions that are measured at fair value it does not include investment securities classified as afs or htm for information on these securities see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements 

citi believes its var model is conservatively calibrated to incorporate fattail scaling and the greater of shortterm approximately the most recent month and longterm three years market volatility the monte carlo simulation involves approximately 450000 market factors making use of approximately 350000 time series with sensitivities updated daily volatility parameters updated intramonthly and correlation parameters updated monthly the conservative features of the var calibration contribute an approximate 26 addon to what would be a var estimated under the assumption of stable and perfectly normally distributed markets 

as set forth in the table below citi’s average trading var decreased from 2018 to 2019 mainly due to changes in interest rates in the icg markets businesses the average trading and credit portfolio var also declined although the decrease in average trading var was partially offset by additional hedging related to lending activities in 2019 

yearend and average trading var and trading and credit portfolio var 



 

the table below provides the range of market factor vars associated with citi’s total trading var inclusive of specific risk 



note no covariance adjustment can be inferred from the above table as the high and low for each market factor will be from different closeofbusiness dates 

the following table provides the var for icg  excluding the cva relating to derivative counterparties hedges of cva fair value option loans and hedges to the loan portfolio 



var model review and validation 

generally citi’s var review and model validation process entails reviewing the model framework major assumptions and implementation of the mathematical algorithm in addition as part of the model validation process product specific backtesting on portfolios is periodically completed and reviewed with citi’s us banking regulators furthermore regulatory var backtesting as described below is performed against buyandhold profit and loss on a monthly basis for multiple subportfolios across the organization trading desk level icg business segment and citigroup and the results are shared with us banking regulators 

significant var model and assumption changes must be independently validated within citi’s risk management organization this validation process includes a review by model validation group within citi’s model risk management in the event of significant model changes parallel model runs are undertaken prior to implementation in addition significant model and assumption changes are subject to the periodic reviews and approval by citi’s us banking regulators 

citi uses the same independently validated var model for both regulatory var and risk management var ie total trading and total trading and credit portfolios vars and as such the model review and validation process for both purposes is as described above 

regulatory var which is calculated in accordance with basel iii differs from risk management var due to the fact that certain positions included in risk management var are not eligible for market risk treatment in regulatory var the 

 

composition of risk management var is discussed under “value at risk” above the applicability of the var model for positions eligible for market risk treatment under us regulatory capital rules is periodically reviewed and approved by citi’s us banking regulators 

in accordance with basel iii regulatory var includes all trading bookcovered positions and all foreign exchange and commodity exposures pursuant to basel iii regulatory var excludes positions that fail to meet the intent and ability to trade requirements and are therefore classified as nontrading book and categories of exposures that are specifically excluded as covered positions regulatory var excludes cva on derivative instruments and dva on citi’s own fair value option liabilities cva hedges are excluded from regulatory var and included in credit riskweighted assets as computed under the advanced approaches for determining riskweighted assets 

regulatory var backtesting 

in accordance with basel iii citi is required to perform backtesting to evaluate the effectiveness of its regulatory var model regulatory var backtesting is the process in which the daily oneday var at a 99 confidence interval is compared to the buyandhold profit and loss ie the profit and loss impact if the portfolio is held constant at the end of the day and repriced the following day buyandhold profit and loss represents the daily marktomarket profit and loss attributable to price movements in covered positions from the close of the previous business day buyandhold profit and loss excludes realized trading revenue net interest fees and commissions intraday trading profit and loss and changes in reserves 

based on a 99 confidence level citi would expect two to three days in any one year when buyandhold losses exceed the regulatory var given the conservative calibration of citi’s var model as a result of taking the greater of short and longterm volatilities and fattail scaling of volatilities citi would expect fewer exceptions under normal and stable market conditions periods of unstable market conditions could increase the number of backtesting exceptions 

the following graph shows the daily buyandhold profit and loss associated with citi’s covered positions compared to citi’s oneday regulatory var during 2019  as of december 31 2019 there were no backtesting exceptions observed for citi’s regulatory var for the prior 12 months 

the difference between the 548 of days with buyandhold gains for regulatory var backtesting and the 100 of days with trading net interest and other revenue associated with citi’s trading businesses shown in the histogram of daily tradingrelated revenue below reflects among other things that a significant portion of citi’s tradingrelated revenue is not generated from daily price movements on these positions and exposures as well as differences in the portfolio composition of regulatory var and risk management var 

 



 

stress testing 

citi performs market risk stress testing on a regular basis to estimate the impact of extreme market movements it is performed on individual positions and trading portfolios as well as in aggregate inclusive of multiple trading portfolios citi’s market risk management after consultations with the businesses develops both systemic and specific stress scenarios reviews the output of periodic stress testing exercises and uses the information to assess the ongoing appropriateness of exposure levels and limits citi uses two complementary approaches to market risk stress testing across all major risk factors ie equity foreign exchange commodity interest rate and credit spreads topdown systemic stresses and bottomup businessspecific stresses systemic stresses are designed to quantify the potential impact of extreme market movements on an institutionwide basis and are constructed using both historical periods of market stress and projections of adverse economic scenarios businessspecific stresses are designed to probe the risks of particular portfolios and market segments especially those risks that are not fully captured in var and systemic stresses 

the systemic stress scenarios and businessspecific stress scenarios at citi are used in several reports reviewed by senior management and also to calculate internal risk capital for trading market risk in general changes in market values are defined over a oneyear horizon for the most liquid positions and market factors changes in market values are defined over a shorter twomonth horizon the limited set of positions and market factors whose market value changes are defined over a twomonth horizon are those that in management’s judgment have historically remained very liquid during financial crises even as the trading liquidity of most other positions and market factors materially declined 

operational risk 

overview 

operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes systems or human factors or from external events it includes risk of failing to comply with applicable laws and regulations but excludes strategic risk operational risk includes the reputation and franchise risk associated with business practices or market conduct in which citi is involved as well as compliance conduct and legal risks 

operational risk is inherent in citi’s global business activities as well as related support functions and can result in losses arising from events associated with the following among others 

 

citi manages operational risk consistent with the overall framework described in “managing global risk—overview” above the company’s goal is to keep operational risk at appropriate levels relative to the characteristics of citi’s businesses the markets in which it operates its capital and liquidity and the competitive economic and regulatory environment 

to anticipate mitigate and control operational risk citi has established policies and a global framework for assessing monitoring and communicating operational risks and the overall operating effectiveness of the internal control environment across citigroup as part of this framework citi has defined its operational risk appetite and has established a manager’s control assessment mca process a process through which managers at citi identify monitor measure report on and manage risks and the related controls to help managers selfassess significant operational risks and key controls and identify and address weaknesses in the design andor operating effectiveness of internal controls that mitigate significant operational risks 

each major business segment must implement an operational risk process consistent with the requirements of this framework the process for operational risk management includes the following steps 

 

as new products and business activities are developed processes are designed modified or sourced through alternative means and operational risks are considered 

 

an operational risk management committee has been established to provide oversight for operational risk across citigroup and to provide a forum to assess citi’s operational risk profile and ensure actions are taken so that citi’s operational risk exposure is actively managed consistent with citi’s risk appetite the committee seeks to ensure that these actions address the root causes that persistently lead to operational risk losses and create lasting solutions to minimize these losses members include citi’s chief risk officer and citi’s head of operational risk and senior members of their organizations these members cover multiple dimensions of risk management and include business and regional chief risk officers and senior operational risk managers 

in addition risk management including operational risk management works proactively with the businesses and other independent control functions to embed a strong operational risk management culture and framework across citi operational risk management engages with the businesses to ensure effective implementation of the operational risk management framework by focusing on i identification analysis and assessment of operational risks ii effective challenge of key control issues and operational risks and iii anticipation and mitigation of operational risk events 

information about the businesses’ operational risk historical operational risk losses and the control environment is reported by each major business segment and functional area the information is summarized and reported to senior management as well as to the audit and risk committees of citi’s board of directors 

operational risk is measured and assessed through operational risk capital and operational risk regulatory capital for the advanced approaches under basel iii projected operational risk losses under stress scenarios are also required as part of the federal reserve board’s ccar process 

for additional information on citi’s operational risks see “risk factors—operational risk” above 

cybersecurity risk 

cybersecurity risk is the business risk associated with the threat posed by a cyber attack cyber breach or the failure to protect citi’s most vital business information assets or operations resulting in a financial or reputational loss for additional information see the operational systems and cybersecurity risk factors in “risk factors—operational risks” above with an evolving threat landscape everincreasing sophistication of cybersecurity attacks and use of new technologies to conduct financial transactions citi and its clients customers and third parties are and will continue to be at risk for cyber attacks and information security incidents citi recognizes the significance of these risks and therefore employs an intelligenceled strategy to prevent detect respond to and recover from cyber attacks further citi actively participates in financial industry government and crosssector knowledgesharing groups to enhance individual and collective cyber resilience 

citi’s technology and cybersecurity risk management program is built on three lines of defense citi’s first line of defense under the office of the chief information security officer provides frontline business operational and technical controls and capabilities to protect against cybersecurity risks and to respond to cyber incidents and data breaches citi manages these threats through stateoftheart fusion centers which serve as central command for monitoring and coordinating responses to cyber threats the enterprise information security team is responsible for infrastructure defense and security controls performing vulnerability assessments and thirdparty information security assessments employee awareness and training programs and security incident management in each case working in coordination with a network of information security officers who are embedded within the businesses and functions on a global basis 

citi’s operational risk managementtechnology and cyber ormtc and independent compliance risk managementtechnology and information security icrmt groups serve as the second line of defense and actively evaluate anticipate and challenge citi’s risk mitigation practices and capabilities internal audit serves as the third line of defense and independently provides assurance on how effectively the organization as a whole manages cybersecurity risk citi also has multiple senior committees such as the information security risk committee isrc which governs enterpriselevel risk tolerance inclusive of cybersecurity risk 

citi seeks to proactively identify and remediate technology and cybersecurity risks before they materialize as incidents that negatively affect business operations accordingly the ormtc team independently challenges and monitors capabilities in accordance with citi’s defined technology and cyber risk appetite statements to address evolving cybersecurity risks and corresponding regulations ormtc also monitors cyber legal and regulatory requirements identifies and defines emerging risks executes strategic cyber threat assessments performs new products and initiative reviews performs data management risk oversight and conducts cyber risk assurance reviews inclusive of thirdparty assessments in addition ormtc employs tools and oversees and challenges metrics that are both tailored to cybersecurity and technology and aligned with citi’s overall operational risk management framework to effectively track identify and manage risk 

compliance risk 

compliance risk is the risk to current or projected financial condition and resilience arising from violations of laws or regulations or from nonconformance with prescribed practices internal policies and procedures or ethical standards this risk exposes a bank to fines civil money penalties payment of damages and the voiding of contracts compliance risk is not limited to risk from failure to comply with consumer protection laws it encompasses the risk of noncompliance with all laws and regulations as well as prudent ethical standards and contractual obligations it also includes the exposure to litigation known as legal risk from all aspects of banking traditional and nontraditional 

 

compliance risk spans all risk types in citi’s risk governance framework and the risk categories outlined in the governance risk compliance grc taxonomy citi seeks to operate with integrity maintain strong ethical standards and adhere to applicable policies and regulatory and legal requirements citi must maintain and execute a proactive compliance risk management crm policy that is designed to manage compliance risk effectively across citi with a view to fundamentally strengthen the compliance risk management culture across the lines of defense taking into account citi’s risk governance framework and regulatory requirements independent compliance risk management’s icrm primary objectives are to 

 

to anticipate control and mitigate compliance risk citi has established the crm policy to achieve standardization and centralization of methodologies and processes and to enable more consistent and comprehensive execution of compliance risk management 

citi has a commitment as well as an obligation to identify assess and mitigate compliance risks associated with its businesses and functions icrm is responsible for oversight of citi’s crm policy while all businesses and global control functions are responsible for managing their compliance risks and operating within the compliance risk appetite 

citi carries out its objectives and fulfills its responsibilities through the integrated crm policy which is based upon four components i governance and organization ii compliance risk requirements iii processes and activities and iv resources and capabilities to achieve this citi follows these crm policy process steps 



 

reputation risk 

citi’s reputation is a vital asset in building trust with its stakeholders and citi is diligent in communicating its corporate values to its employees customers and investors to support this citi has defined a reputation risk appetite approach under this approach each major business segment has implemented a risk appetite statement and related key indicators to monitor and address weaknesses that may result in significant reputation risks the approach requires that each business segment or region escalates significant reputation risks that require review or mitigation through its business practice committee or equivalent 

the business practices committees are part of the governance infrastructure that citi has in place to properly review business activities sales practices product design perceived conflicts of interest and other potential franchise or reputation risks these committees may also raise potential franchise reputation or systemic risks for due consideration by the business practices committee at the corporate level all of these committees which are composed of citi’s most senior executives provide the guidance necessary for citi’s business practices to meet the highest standards of professionalism integrity and ethical behavior consistent with citi’s mission and value proposition 

further the responsibility for maintaining citi’s reputation is shared by all employees who are guided by citi’s code of conduct employees are expected to exercise sound judgment and common sense in decisions and actions they are also expected to promptly and appropriately escalate all issues that present potential franchise reputation andor systemic risk 

strategic risk 

overview 

citi executive management with citi’s ceo at the lead is responsible for the development and execution of citi’s strategy this strategy is translated into forwardlooking plans that are then cascaded across the organization strategic risk is monitored through a range of practices regular citigroup board of director meetings provide strategic external checkpoints where management’s progress against executing the plans is assessed and where decisions to refine the strategic direction of the company are evaluated citi’s 

 

executive management assesses progress against executing the defined plans ceo reviews which include a risk assessment of the plans occur across products regions and functions to focus on progress against executing the plans products regions and functions have internal reviews to assess performance at lower levels across the organization and specific forums exist to focus on key areas that drive strategic risk such as balance sheet management the introduction of new or modified products and services and country management among others in addition to these daytoday practices significant strategic actions such as mergers acquisitions or capital expenditures are reviewed and approved by or notified to the citigroup and citibank boards of directors as appropriate 

exit of uk from eu 

as a result of a 2016 uk referendum citi has reorganized certain uk and eu operations and implemented contingency plans to address the uk’s official exit from the eu which occurred as of january 31 2020 in addition citi has established a formal program with seniorlevel sponsorship and governance to deliver a coordinated response to the uk’s exit 

until negotiations between the uk and the eu are finalized and any exit agreement is ratified citi continues to plan for a “hard” exit scenario citi’s strategy focuses on providing continuity of services to its uk and eu clients with minimal disruption consequently citi has migrated certain business activities to alternative legal entities and branches with appropriate regulatory permissions to carry out such activity and has established required capabilities in the uk and eu citi’s plans for a uk exit from the eu have primarily covered 

 

citi has worked closely with clients regulators and other relevant stakeholders in the execution of its plans to prepare for the uk’s exit from the eu in addition citi continues to monitor macroeconomic scenarios and market events and has been undertaking stress testing to assess potential impacts on its businesses for additional information see “risk factors—strategic risks” above 

libor transition risk 

citi recognizes that a transition away from and discontinuance of libor presents risks and challenges that could significantly impact financial markets and market participants including citi for information about citi’s risks from a transition away from and discontinuation of libor or any 

other benchmark see “risk factors—strategic risks” above accordingly citi has continued its efforts to identify and manage its libor transition risks 

citi’s libor governance and implementation program remains focused on identifying and addressing the libor transition impacts to citi’s clients operational capabilities and legal and financial contracts among others the program operates globally across citi’s businesses and functions and includes active involvement of senior management oversight by citi’s asset and liability committee and reporting to the risk management committee of citigroup’s board of directors as part of the program citi has developed libor transition action plans and associated roadmaps under the following key workstreams program management transition strategy and risk management customer management including internal communications and training legalcontract management and product management financial exposures and risk management regulatory and industry engagement operations and technology and finance risk tax and treasury 

during 2019 citi continued to participate in a number of working groups formed by global regulators including the alternative reference rates committee arrc convened by the federal reserve board these working groups continue to promote and advance development of alternative reference rates and to identify and address potential challenges from any transition to such rates citi also continues to engage with and monitor developments involving regulators financial accounting bodies and others on libor transition matters and relief 

moreover citi has been investing in its systems and infrastructure as client activity moves away from libor to alternative reference rates citi also has continued to identify its libor transition exposures including existing financial instruments that do not contain contract provisions that adequately contemplate the discontinuance of reference rates and that would require additional negotiation with counterparties in addition citi has begun to mitigate its libor transition exposures by among other things using alternative reference rates in certain newly issued financial instruments and products for example since early 2019 citi has issued both preferred stock and benchmark debt referencing the secured overnight financing rate sofr and updated the libor determination method in its debt documentation with the arrc recommended fallback language citi has also been conducting libor transitionrelated training for employees 

country risk 

top 25 country exposures 

the following table presents citi’s top 25 exposures by 

country excluding the us as of december 31 2019 the total exposure as of december 31 2019 to the top 25 countries disclosed below in combination with the us would represent approximately 95 of citi’s exposure to all countries for purposes of the table loan amounts are reflected in the country where the loan is booked which is generally based on the domicile of the borrower for example a loan to a chinese subsidiary of a switzerlandbased corporation will generally be categorized as a loan in china in addition citi has developed regional booking centers in certain countries 

 

most significantly in the united kingdom uk and ireland in order to more efficiently serve its corporate customers as an example with respect to the uk only 33 of corporate 

loans presented in the table below are to uk domiciled 

entities 35 for unfunded commitments with the balance of 

the loans predominately to european domiciled counterparties 

approximately 85 of the total uk funded loans and 89 of 

the total uk unfunded commitments were investment grade 

as of december 31 2019 trading account assets and investment securities are generally categorized based on the domicile of the issuer of the security of the underlying reference entity for additional information on the assets included in the table see the footnotes to the table below 

  





 

argentina 

citi operates in argentina through its icg businesses as of december 31 2019 citi’s net investment in its argentine operations was approximately 730 million citi uses the us dollar as the functional currency for its operations in argentina because the argentine economy is considered highly inflationary under us gaap 

during 2019 the argentine peso depreciated 59 against the us dollar and the us rating agencies downgraded argentina’s sovereign debt rating given renewed concerns of a debt default in addition the government of argentina reprofiled certain shortterm debt obligations and also implemented new capital and currency controls during the third quarter of 2019 prior to the implementation of these new capital controls citi had already remitted all available earnings from its argentine operations that could be remitted during the 2019 calendar year the new controls may restrict citi’s ability to access us dollars in argentina and remit earnings from its argentine operations in the future 

citi economically hedges the foreign currency risk in its net argentine pesodenominated assets to the extent possible and prudent using nondeliverable forward ndf derivative instruments that are executed outside of argentina as of december 31 2019 the international ndf market had very limited liquidity resulting in citi being unable to economically hedge a significant portion of its argentine peso exposure to the extent that citi is unable to execute additional ndf contracts in the future devaluations on citi’s net argentine pesodenominated assets would be recorded in earnings without any benefit from a change in the fair value of derivative positions used to economically hedge the exposure 

in addition citi continually evaluates its economic exposure to its argentine counterparties and reserves for changes in credit risk and sovereign risk associated with its argentine assets citi believes it has established appropriate loan loss reserves on its argentine loans and appropriate fair value adjustments on argentine assets and liabilities measured at fair value for such risks under us gaap as of december 31 2019 however given the recent events in argentina us regulatory agencies may require citi to record additional reserves in the future increasing icg ’s cost of credit based on the perceived country risk associated with its argentine exposures for additional information on emerging markets risks see “risk factors—strategic risks” above 

 

ffiec—crossborder claims on third parties and local country assets 

citi’s crossborder disclosures are based on the country exposure bank regulatory reporting guidelines of the federal financial institutions examination council ffiec the following summarizes some of the ffiec key reporting guidelines 

 

given the requirements noted above citi’s ffiec crossborder exposures and total outstandings tend to fluctuate in some cases significantly from period to period as an example because total outstandings under ffiec guidelines do not include the benefit of margin or hedges market volatility in interest rates foreign exchange rates and credit spreads may cause significant fluctuations in the level of total outstandings all else being equal 

the tables below show each country whose total outstandings exceeded 075 of total citigroup assets 









significant accounting policies and significant estimates 

this section contains a summary of citi’s most significant accounting policies note 1 to the consolidated financial statements contains a summary of all of citigroup’s significant accounting policies these policies as well as estimates made by management are integral to the presentation of citi’s results of operations and financial condition while all of these policies require a certain level of management judgment and estimates this section highlights and discusses the significant accounting policies that require management to make highly difficult complex or subjective judgments and estimates at times regarding matters that are inherently uncertain and susceptible to change see also “risk factors—operational risks” above management has discussed each of these significant accounting policies the related estimates and its judgments with the audit committee of the citigroup board of directors 

valuations of financial instruments 

citigroup holds debt and equity securities derivatives retained interests in securitizations investments in private equity and other financial instruments substantially all of 

these assets and liabilities are reflected at fair value on citi’s 

consolidated balance sheet 

citi purchases securities under agreements to resell reverse repos and sells securities under agreements 

to repurchase repos a majority of which are carried at 

fair value in addition certain loans shortterm borrowings 

longterm debt and deposits as well as certain securities 

borrowed and loaned positions that are collateralized with 

cash are carried at fair value citigroup holds its investments trading assets and liabilities and resale and repurchase agreements on the consolidated balance sheet to meet customer needs and to manage liquidity needs interest rate risks and private equity investing 

when available citi generally uses quoted market prices to determine fair value and classifies such items within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy established under asc 82010 fair value measurement  if quoted market prices are not available fair value is based upon internally developed valuation models that use where possible current marketbased or independently sourced market parameters such as interest rates currency rates and option volatilities such models are often based on a discounted cash flow analysis in addition items valued using such internally generated valuation techniques are classified according to the lowest level input or value driver that is significant to the valuation thus an item may be classified under the fair value hierarchy as level 3 even though there may be some significant inputs that are readily observable 

citi is required to exercise subjective judgments relating to the applicability and functionality of internal valuation models the significance of inputs or value drivers to the valuation of an instrument and the degree of illiquidity and subsequent lack of observability in certain markets these judgments have the potential to impact the company’s financial performance for instruments where the changes in 

 

fair value are recognized in either the consolidated statement of income or in aoci  

moreover for certain investments decreases in fair value are only recognized in earnings in the consolidated statement of income if such decreases are judged to be an otherthantemporary impairment otti adjudicating the temporary nature of fair value impairments is also inherently judgmental 

the fair value of financial instruments incorporates the effects of citi’s own credit risk and the market view of counterparty credit risk the quantification of which is also complex and judgmental for additional information on citi’s fair value analysis see notes 1 6 24 and 25 to the consolidated financial statements

management provides reserves for an estimate of probable losses inherent in the funded loan portfolio and in unfunded loan commitments and standby letters of credit on the consolidated balance sheet in the allowance for loan losses and in other liabilities  respectively 

estimates of these probable losses are based upon i citigroup’s internal system of creditrisk ratings that are analogous to the risk ratings of the major credit rating agencies and ii historical default and loss data including rating agency information regarding default rates from 1983 to 2017 and internal data dating to the early 1970s on severity of losses in the event of default adjustments may be made to this data including i statistically calculated estimates to cover the historical fluctuation of the default rates over the credit cycle the historical variability of loss severity among defaulted loans and the degree to which there are large obligor concentrations in the global portfolio and ii adjustments made for specifically known items such as current environmental factors and credit trends 

in addition representatives from both the risk management and finance staffs who cover business areas with delinquencymanaged portfolios containing smaller balance homogeneous loans present their recommended reserve balances based upon leading credit indicators including loan delinquencies and changes in portfolio size as well as economic trends including housing prices unemployment and gdp this methodology is applied separately for each individual product within each geographic region in which these portfolios exist 

this evaluation process is subject to numerous estimates and judgments the frequency of default risk ratings loss recovery rates the size and diversity of individual large credits and the ability of borrowers with foreign currency obligations to obtain the foreign currency necessary for orderly debt servicing among other things are all taken into account during this review changes in these estimates could have a direct impact on citi’s credit costs and the allowance in any period

goodwill 

citi tests goodwill for impairment annually on july 1 the annual test and through interim assessments between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would morelikelythannot reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount such as a significant adverse change in the business climate a decision to sell or dispose of all or a significant portion of a reporting unit or a significant decline in citi’s stock price during 2019 the annual test was performed which resulted in no goodwill impairment as described in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

as of december 31 2019 citigroup’s activities are conducted through the global consumer banking and institutional clients group business segments and corporateother  goodwill impairment testing is performed at the level below the business segment referred to as a reporting unit 

citi utilizes allocated equity as a proxy for the carrying value of its reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing the allocated equity in the reporting units is determined based on the capital the business would require if it were operating as a standalone entity incorporating sufficient capital to be in compliance with both current and expected regulatory capital requirements including capital for specifically identified goodwill and intangible assets the capital allocated to the businesses is incorporated into the annual budget process which is approved by citi’s board of directors 

goodwill impairment testing involves management judgment requiring an assessment of whether the carrying value of the reporting unit can be supported by the fair value of the reporting unit using widely accepted valuation techniques such as the market approach earnings multiples andor transaction multiples andor the income approach discounted cash flow dcf method in applying these methodologies citi utilizes a number of factors including actual operating results future business plans economic projections and market data 

similar to 2018  citigroup engaged an independent valuation specialist in 2019 to assist in citi’s valuation for all the reporting units with goodwill balances employing both the market approach and the dcf method the resulting fair values were relatively consistent and appropriate weighting was given to outputs from both methods 

the dcf method utilized at the time of each impairment test used discount rates that citi believes adequately reflected the risk and uncertainty in the financial markets in the internally generated cash flow projections the dcf method employs a capital asset pricing model in estimating the discount rate 

since none of the company’s reporting units are publicly traded individual reporting unit fair value determinations cannot be directly correlated to citigroup’s common stock price the sum of the fair values of the 

 

reporting units exceeded the overall market capitalization of citi as of july 1 2019 however citi believes that it is not meaningful to reconcile the sum of the fair values of the company’s reporting units to its market capitalization due to several factors the market capitalization of citigroup reflects the execution risk in a transaction involving citigroup due to its size however the individual reporting units’ fair values are not subject to the same level of execution risk nor a business model that is perceived to be as complex in addition the market capitalization of citigroup does not include consideration of the individual reporting unit’s control premium 

see notes 1 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on goodwill including the changes in the goodwill balance yearoveryear and the reporting units’ goodwill balances as of december 31 2019  

income taxes 

overview 

citi is subject to the income tax laws of the us its states and local municipalities and the nonus jurisdictions in which citi operates these tax laws are complex and are subject to differing interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be subject to review and adjudication by the court systems of the various tax jurisdictions or may be settled with the taxing authority upon audit 

in establishing a provision for income tax expense citi must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws citi must also make estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions both domestic and foreign deferred taxes are recorded for the future consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns based upon enacted tax laws and rates deferred tax assets dtas are recognized subject to management’s judgment that realization is morelikelythannot for example if it is morelikelythannot that a carryforward would expire unused citi would set up a valuation allowance against that dta citi has established valuation allowances as described below 

as a result of the tax cuts and jobs act tax reform beginning in 2018 citi is taxed on income generated by its us operations at a federal tax rate of 21 the effect on citi’s state tax rate is dependent upon how and when the individual states choose to or automatically adopt the various new provisions of the us internal revenue code 

citi’s nonus branches and subsidiaries are subject to tax at their local tax rates while nonus branches continue to be subject to us taxation citi expects no material residual us tax on such earnings since its overall nonus branch tax rate is in excess of 21 with respect to nonus subsidiaries dividends from these subsidiaries will be excluded from us taxation while the majority of citi’s nonus subsidiary earnings are classified as global intangible low taxed income gilti citi similarly 

expects no material residual us tax on such earnings based on its nonus subsidiaries’ local tax rates which exceed on average the gilti tax rate finally citi does not expect the base erosion antiabuse tax beat to affect its tax provision 

deferred tax assets and valuation allowances 

at december 31 2019 citi had net dtas of 231 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019 citi’s dtas increased by 06 billion driven primarily by the release of a portion of the valuation allowance related to citi’s general basket ftc carryforwards and losses in aoci  on a fullyear basis citi’s dtas increased 02 billion from 229 billion at december 31 2018 primarily due to the releases of a portion of the valuation allowance related to citi’s general basket ftc carryforwards partially offset by gains in aoci  

of citi’s total net dtas of 231 billion as of december 31 2019 107 billion primarily related to tax carryforwards was excluded in calculating citi’s regulatory capital the amount excluded from citi’s regulatory capital decreased 09 billion in the full year 2019 adjusting for the impact of the valuation allowance releases net dtas arising from temporary differences are deducted from regulatory capital if in excess of the 1015 limitations see “capital resources” above for the year ended december 31 2019 citi did not have any such dtas accordingly the remaining 124 billion of net dtas as of december 31 2019 was not deducted in calculating regulatory capital pursuant to basel iii standards and was appropriately risk weighted under those rules 

citi’s total valuation allowance at december 31 2019 was 65 billion a decrease of 28 billion from 93 billion at december 31 2018 the decrease was primarily driven by carryforward expirations in the ftc branch basket and in a nonus nol ftc general basket valuation allowance releases and a reduction in the net us residual dta related to nonus branches citi’s valuation allowance of 65 billion is composed of 46 billion on its ftc carryforwards 08 billion on its us residual dta related to its nonus branches 10 billion on local nonus dtas and 01 billion on state net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards 

citi’s valuation allowance of 35 billion against ftc carryforwards relating to its nonus branches decreased by 09 billion in 2019 primarily due to the expiration of the 2009 ftc carryforward citi expects that the absolute amount of its valuation allowance may change in future years as it generates additional ftcs relating to the higher overall local tax rate of its nonus branches reduced by the expiration of ftc carryforwards 

citi’s valuation allowance of 11 billion against ftc carryforwards in its general basket decreased by 05 billion primarily due to actions taken to increase foreign source income in the us and the updated forecast of foreign source income for the ftc carryforward period in the fourth quarter of 2019 citi committed to a plan to move a financing business involving nonus clients and its associated funding to the us the incremental foreign 

 

source income generated by this action over time will morelikelythannot enable usage of ftc carryforwards of 02 billion see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements as stated above with respect to the portion of the valuation allowance established on citi’s ftc carryforwards that are available for use in the general basket changes in the amount of earnings from sources outside the us could alter the amount of valuation allowance that is eventually needed against such ftcs citi continues to look for other actions that may improve foreign source income in the us tax return and thus affect the valuation allowance these actions can include the relocation of certain businesses to the us each of which can raise client regulatory or operational challenges no other actions were deemed prudent and feasible as of december 31 2019 

recognized ftcs comprised approximately 63 billion of citi’s dtas as of december 31 2019 compared to approximately 68 billion as of december 31 2018 the decrease in ftcs yearoveryear was primarily due to currentyear usage partially offset by the valuation allowance release the ftc carryforward period represents the most timesensitive component of citi’s dtas 

citi has an overall domestic loss odl of approximately 39 billion at december 31 2019 which allows citi to elect a percentage between 50 and 100 of future years’ domestic source income to be reclassified as foreign source income see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the odl 

citi believes the us federal and new york state and city net operating loss carryforward period of 20 years provides enough time to fully utilize the net dtas pertaining to the existing net operating loss carryforwards this is due to citi’s forecast of sufficient us taxable income and the continued taxation of citi’s nonus income by new york state and city although realization is not assured citi believes that the realization of its recognized net dtas of 231 billion at december 31 2019 is morelikelythannot based upon management’s expectations as to future taxable income in the jurisdictions in which the dtas arise as well as available tax planning strategies as defined in asc topic 740 income taxes  citi has concluded that it has the necessary positive evidence to support the realization of its net dtas after taking its valuation allowances into consideration 

for additional information on citi’s income taxes including its income tax provision tax assets and liabilities and a tabular summary of citi’s net dtas balance as of december 31 2019 including the ftcs and applicable expiration dates of the ftcs see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for information on citi’s ability to use its dtas see “risk factors—strategic risks” above 

tax cuts and jobs act 

on december 22 2017 the president signed tax reform into law reflecting changes to us corporate taxation including a lower statutory tax rate of 21 a quasiterritorial regime and a deemed repatriation of all accumulated earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries the new law was generally effective january 1 2018 

citi recorded a onetime noncash charge to continuing operations of 226 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017 composed of i a 124 billion remeasurement due to the reduction of the us corporate tax rate and the change to a “quasiterritorial tax system” ii a 79 billion valuation allowance against citi’s ftc carryforwards and its us residual dtas related to its nonus branches and iii a 23 billion reduction in citi’s ftc carryforwards related to the deemed repatriation of undistributed earnings of nonus subsidiaries of this onetime charge 164 billion was 

 

considered provisional pursuant to staff accounting bulletin sab 118 

citi completed its accounting for tax reform under sab 118 during the fourth quarter of 2018 and recorded a onetime noncash tax benefit of 94 million in corporateother  related to amounts that were considered provisional pursuant to sab 118

critical audit matters 

the critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that 1 relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and 2 involved our especially challenging subjective or complex judgments the communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole and we are not by communicating the critical audit matters below providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate 

assessment of the fair value of hardtoprice financial instruments 

as described in notes 1 6 24 and 25 to the consolidated financial statements the company’s financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis were 11487 billion and 6155 billion respectively at december 31 2019 financial instruments which are measured at fair value using valuation techniques inclusive of complex internal valuation models or alternative pricing procedures with significant unobservable inputs represent all level 3 assets and liabilities 80 billion and 230 billion respectively and certain level 2 assets and liabilities collectively hardtoprice financial instruments the company estimated the fair value of hardtoprice financial instruments utilizing various valuation techniques including but not limited to internal valuation models pricebased or comparables analysis and discounted cash flows 

we identified the assessment of the fair value for hardtoprice financial instruments as a critical audit matter as the assessment involved complex auditor judgment in particular there was a high level of subjectivity in the evaluation of the key assumptions and estimates utilized for prices andor inputs that are not readily observable in the current market and complex internally developed valuation techniques andor models were used this assessment encompassed the evaluation of the fair value estimate methodologies including the company’s key assumptions and inputs such as interest rate price yield credit spread volatilities correlations and forward prices this also included an evaluation of the underlying models for mathematical accuracy and assessing if the models are appropriate to value the financial instruments 

the following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter we tested internal controls over hardtoprice financial instruments including pricing methodologies and valuation techniques and key inputs and assumptions to determine the fair value we tested the company’s process to develop the fair value estimate this included performing an assessment of the key policies and methodologies used in the fair value determination we involved valuation professionals with industry knowledge and experience 

 

who assisted in challenging the models’ significant prices inputs and assumptions that are not readily observable and which are used in the fair value determination by testing the reliability of the process used by the company to determine fair value and evaluating that 

 

we involved valuation professionals with industry knowledge and experience who assisted in developing an independent fair value estimate for certain financial instruments based on independently developed valuation models andor assumptions and comparing to the company’s fair value measurements 

assessment of the allowance for loan losses collectively evaluated for impairment 

as discussed in notes 1 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements the company’s allowance for loan losses related to loans collectively evaluated for impairment all was 113 billion as of december 31 2019 the company estimated this all for consumer loans utilizing a migration analysis in which historical delinquency and credit loss experience is applied to the current aging of the portfolio together with analyses that reflect economic conditions for corporate loans the all was determined using a statistical model considering the portfolio’s size remaining tenor and credit quality as measured by internal risk ratings assigned to individual credit facilities which reflect probability of default and loss given default the statistical model and migration analysis were each supplemented by qualitative assessments 

we identified the assessment of the all as a critical audit matter as the assessment involved significant measurement uncertainty requiring complex auditor judgment and knowledge and experience in the industry this assessment encompassed the evaluation of the various components of the all methodology including certain key assumptions and inputs for the company’s quantitative and qualitative assessments key assumptions and inputs for consumer loans included historical credit losses delinquency status and the manner in which they are applied within a migration analysis for corporate loans key assumptions and inputs included internal risk ratings probability of default and loss given default considered in the statistical model 

the following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter we tested certain internal controls over 1 the approval of the all methodologies and 2 the determination of the key 

assumptions and inputs used to estimate the quantitative and qualitative assessments we evaluated the company’s process to develop the all estimate by testing certain sources of data factors and assumptions that the company used and considered the relevance and reliability of such data factors and assumptions we assessed the methodologies used to develop the resulting qualitative assessments and the effect of those assessments on the all compared with credit trends we involved credit risk professionals with industry knowledge and experience who assisted in 

 

we tested corporate loan internal risk ratings for a selection of credit facilities by 1 involving credit risk professionals with industry knowledge and risk rating experience to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of the internal risk ratings and 2 testing the historical accuracy of internal risk ratings compared to prior periods 

assessment of the realizability of deferred tax assets specifically as it relates to foreign tax credits 

as discussed in notes 1 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements the company’s net deferred tax assets dta were 231 billion as of december 31 2019 this balance is net of a valuation allowance of 65 billion recorded by the company the estimation of the dta for foreign tax credits ftcs and related valuation allowance was 109 billion and 46 billion respectively the company evaluated the realization of the dta for ftcs to determine whether there was more than a 50 likelihood that the dta for ftcs would be realized based primarily on the company’s expectations of future taxable income in each relevant jurisdiction available tax planning strategies and timing of tax credit expirations 

we identified the assessment of the realizability of the dta for ftcs as a critical audit matter as the 

 

assessment involved complex auditor judgment and knowledge of global tax regulations this assessment encompassed the evaluation of the company’s estimations that are complex due to its global structure and subjective given the company’s assumptions used to determine that sufficient taxable income will be generated or tax planning strategies implemented to support the realization of the dta for ftcs before expiration of foreign tax credits 

the following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter we tested certain internal controls over the company’s analysis of the realizability of the dta for ftcs including future taxable income and tax planning strategies we tested the company’s process to develop the valuation allowance estimate this included performing an assessment of the key policies and methodologies used in the valuation allowance determination we involved income tax professionals with ftc knowledge and experience including resources from our national office who assisted in assessing 

 

we performed sensitivity analyses over the company’s expectations of future taxable income and timing of tax credit expirations

notes to consolidated financial statements 

1 summary of significant accounting policies 

throughout these notes “citigroup” “citi” and the “company” refer to citigroup inc and its consolidated subsidiaries 

certain reclassifications have been made to the prior periods’ financial statements and notes to conform to the current period’s presentation 

principles of consolidation 

the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of citigroup and its subsidiaries prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap the company consolidates subsidiaries in which it holds directly or indirectly more than 50 of the voting rights or where it exercises control entities where the company holds 20 to 50 of the voting rights andor has the ability to exercise significant influence other than investments of designated venture capital subsidiaries or investments accounted for at fair value under the fair value option are accounted for under the equity method and the pro rata share of their income loss is included in other revenue  income from investments in lessthan 20  owned companies is recognized when dividends are received as discussed in more detail in note 21 to the consolidated financial statements citigroup also consolidates entities deemed to be variable interest entities when citigroup is determined to be the primary beneficiary gains and losses on the disposition of branches subsidiaries affiliates buildings and other investments are included in other revenue  

citibank 

citibank na citibank is a commercial bank and wholly owned subsidiary of citigroup citibank’s principal offerings include consumer finance mortgage lending and retail banking including commercial banking products and services investment banking cash management and trade finance and private banking products and services 

variable interest entities vies 

an entity is a variable interest entity vie if it meets either of the criteria outlined in accounting standards codification asc topic 810 consolidation  which are i the entity has equity that is insufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties or ii the entity has equity investors that cannot make significant decisions about the entity’s operations or that do not absorb their proportionate share of the entity’s expected losses or expected returns 

the company consolidates a vie when it has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the vie’s economic performance and a right to receive benefits or the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could be potentially significant to the vie that is citi is the primary beneficiary in addition to variable interests held in 

 

consolidated vies the company has variable interests in other vies that are not consolidated because the company is not the primary beneficiary 

all unconsolidated vies are monitored by the company to assess whether any events have occurred to cause its primary beneficiary status to change 

all entities not deemed to be vies with which the company has involvement are evaluated for consolidation under other subtopics of asc 810 see note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for more detailed information

trading account assets include debt and marketable equity securities derivatives in a receivable position residual interests in securitizations and physical commodities inventory in addition as described in note 25 to the consolidated financial statements certain assets that citigroup has elected to carry at fair value under the fair value option such as loans and purchased guarantees are also included in trading account assets  

trading account liabilities include securities sold not yet purchased short positions and derivatives in a net payable position as well as certain liabilities that citigroup has elected to carry at fair value as described in note 25 to the consolidated financial statements 

other than physical commodities inventory all trading account assets and liabilities are carried at fair value revenues generated from trading assets and trading liabilities are generally reported in principal transactions and include realized gains and losses as well as unrealized 

 

gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value of such instruments interest income on trading assets is recorded in interest revenue reduced by interest expense on trading liabilities 

physical commodities inventory is carried at the lower of cost or market with related losses reported in principal transactions  realized gains and losses on sales of commodities inventory are included in principal transactions  investments in unallocated precious metals accounts gold silver platinum and palladium are accounted for as hybrid instruments containing a debt host contract and an embedded nonfinancial derivative instrument indexed to the price of the relevant precious metal the embedded derivative instrument is separated from the debt host contract and accounted for at fair value the debt host contract is carried at fair value under the fair value option as described in note 25 to the consolidated financial statements 

derivatives used for trading purposes include interest rate currency equity credit and commodity swap agreements options caps and floors warrants and financial and commodity futures and forward contracts derivative asset and liability positions are presented net by counterparty on the consolidated balance sheet when a valid master netting agreement exists and the other conditions set out in asc topic 21020 balance sheet—offsetting  are met see note 22 to the consolidated financial statements 

the company uses a number of techniques to determine the fair value of trading assets and liabilities which are described in note 24 to the consolidated financial statements 

securities borrowed and securities loaned 

securities borrowing and lending transactions do not constitute a sale of the underlying securities for accounting purposes and are treated as collateralized financing transactions such transactions are recorded at the amount of proceeds advanced or received plus accrued interest as described in note 25 to the consolidated financial statements the company has elected to apply fair value accounting to a number of securities borrowing and lending transactions fees paid or received for all securities lending and borrowing transactions are recorded in interest expense or interest revenue at the contractually specified rate 

the company monitors the fair value of securities borrowed or loaned on a daily basis and obtains or posts additional collateral in order to maintain contractual margin protection 

as described in note 24 to the consolidated financial statements the company uses a discounted cash flow technique to determine the fair value of securities lending and borrowing transactions 

repurchase and resale agreements 

securities sold under agreements to repurchase repos and securities purchased under agreements to resell reverse repos do not constitute a sale or purchase of the underlying securities for accounting purposes and are treated as collateralized financing transactions as described in note 

25 to the consolidated financial statements the company has elected to apply fair value accounting to certain of such transactions with changes in fair value reported in earnings any transactions for which fair value accounting has not been elected are recorded at the amount of cash advanced or received plus accrued interest irrespective of whether the company has elected fair value accounting interest paid or received on all repo and reverse repo transactions is recorded in interest expense or interest revenue at the contractually specified rate 

where the conditions of asc 210204511 balance sheet—offsetting repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements  are met repos and reverse repos are presented net on the consolidated balance sheet 

the company’s policy is to take possession of securities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements the company monitors the fair value of securities subject to repurchase or resale on a daily basis and obtains or posts additional collateral in order to maintain contractual margin protection 

as described in note 24 to the consolidated financial statements the company uses a discounted cash flow technique to determine the fair value of repo and reverse repo transactions 

loans 

loans are reported at their outstanding principal balances net of any unearned income and unamortized deferred fees and costs except for credit card receivable balances which include accrued interest and fees loan origination fees and certain direct origination costs are generally deferred and recognized as adjustments to income over the lives of the related loans 

as described in note 25 to the consolidated financial statements citi has elected fair value accounting for certain loans such loans are carried at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings interest income on such loans is recorded in interest revenue at the contractually specified rate 

loans that are heldforinvestment are classified as loans net of unearned income on the consolidated balance sheet and the related cash flows are included within the cash flows from investing activities category in the consolidated statement of cash flows on the line change in loans  however when the initial intent for holding a loan has changed from heldforinvestment to heldforsale hfs the loan is reclassified to hfs but the related cash flows continue to be reported in cash flows from investing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows on the line proceeds from sales and securitizations of loans  

consumer loans 

consumer loans represent loans and leases managed primarily by the global consumer banking gcb businesses and corporateother  

consumer nonaccrual and reaging policies 

as a general rule interest accrual ceases for installment and real estate both open and closedend loans when payments 

 

are 90 days contractually past due for credit cards and other unsecured revolving loans however citi generally accrues interest until payments are 180 days past due as a result of occ guidance home equity loans in regulated bank entities are classified as nonaccrual if the related residential first mortgage is 90 days or more past due also as a result of occ guidance mortgage loans in regulated bank entities are classified as nonaccrual within 60 days of notification that the borrower has filed for bankruptcy other than federal housing administration fhainsured loans 

loans that have been modified to grant a concession to a borrower in financial difficulty may not be accruing interest at the time of the modification the policy for returning such modified loans to accrual status varies by product andor region in most cases a minimum number of payments ranging from one to six  is required while in other cases the loan is never returned to accrual status for regulated bank entities such modified loans are returned to accrual status if a credit evaluation at the time of or subsequent to the modification indicates the borrower is able to meet the restructured terms and the borrower is current and has demonstrated a reasonable period of sustained payment performance minimum six months of consecutive payments 

for us consumer loans generally one of the conditions to qualify for modification is that a minimum number of payments typically ranging from one to three  must be made upon modification the loan is reaged to current status however reaging practices for certain openended consumer loans such as credit cards are governed by federal financial institutions examination council ffiec guidelines for openended consumer loans subject to ffiec guidelines one of the conditions for the loan to be reaged to current status is that at least three consecutive minimum monthly payments or the equivalent amount must be received in addition under ffiec guidelines the number of times that such a loan can be reaged is subject to limitations generally once in 12 months and twice in five years furthermore fha and department of veterans affairs va loans may only be modified under those respective agencies’ guidelines and payments are not always required in order to reage a modified loan to current 

consumer chargeoff policies 

citi’s chargeoff policies follow the general guidelines below 

 

 

corporate loans 

corporate loans represent loans and leases managed by institutional clients group  icg  corporate loans are identified as impaired and placed on a cash nonaccrual basis when it is determined based on actual experience and a forwardlooking assessment of the collectability of the loan in full that the payment of interest or principal is doubtful or when interest or principal is 90 days past due except when the loan is well collateralized and in the process of collection any interest accrued on impaired corporate loans and leases is reversed at 90 days past due and charged against current earnings and interest is thereafter included in earnings only to the extent actually received in cash when there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectability of principal all cash receipts are thereafter applied to reduce the recorded investment in the loan 

impaired corporate loans and leases are written down to the extent that principal is deemed to be uncollectable impaired collateraldependent loans and leases where repayment is expected to be provided solely by the sale of the underlying collateral and there are no other available and reliable sources of repayment are written down to the lower of carrying value or collateral value cashbasis loans are returned to accrual status when all contractual principal and interest amounts are reasonably assured of repayment and there is a sustained period of repayment performance in accordance with the contractual terms 

loans heldforsale 

corporate and consumer loans that have been identified for sale are classified as loans hfs and included in other assets  the practice of citi’s us prime mortgage business has been to sell substantially all of its conforming loans as such us prime mortgage conforming loans are classified as hfs and the fair value option is elected at origination with changes in fair value recorded in other revenue  with the exception of those loans for which the fair value option has been elected hfs loans are accounted for at the lower of cost or market value with any writedowns or subsequent recoveries charged to other revenue  the related cash flows are classified in the consolidated statement of cash flows in the cash flows from operating activities category on the line change in loans heldforsale  

 

allowance for loan losses 

allowance for loan losses represents management’s best estimate of probable losses inherent in the portfolio including probable losses related to large individually evaluated impaired loans and troubled debt restructurings attribution of the allowance is made for analytical purposes only and the entire allowance is available to absorb probable loan losses inherent in the overall portfolio additions to the allowance are made through the provision for loan losses  loan losses are deducted from the allowance and subsequent recoveries are added assets received in exchange for loan claims in a restructuring are initially recorded at fair value with any gain or loss reflected as a recovery or chargeoff in the provision 

consumer loans 

for consumer loans each portfolio of nonmodified smallerbalance homogeneous loans is independently evaluated for impairment by product type eg residential mortgage credit card etc in accordance with asc 450 contingencies  the allowance for loan losses attributed to these loans is established via a process that estimates the probable losses inherent in the specific portfolio this process includes migration analysis in which historical delinquency and credit loss experience is applied to the current aging of the portfolio together with analyses that reflect current and anticipated economic conditions including changes in housing prices and unemployment trends citi’s allowance for loan losses under asc 450 only considers contractual principal amounts due except for credit card loans where estimated loss amounts related to accrued interest receivable are also included 

management also considers overall portfolio indicators including historical credit losses delinquent nonperforming and classified loans trends in volumes and terms of loans an evaluation of overall credit quality the credit process including lending policies and procedures and economic geographical product and other environmental factors 

separate valuation allowances are determined for impaired smallerbalance homogeneous loans whose terms have been modified in a troubled debt restructuring tdr longterm modification programs and shortterm less than 12 months modifications that provide concessions such as interest rate reductions to borrowers in financial difficulty are reported as tdrs in addition loan modifications that involve a trial period are reported as tdrs at the start of the trial period the allowance for loan losses for tdrs is determined in accordance with asc 3101035 receivables—subsequent measurement  considering all available evidence including as appropriate the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s original contractual effective rate the secondary market value of the loan and the fair value of collateral less disposal costs these expected cash flows incorporate modification program default rate assumptions the original contractual effective rate for credit card loans is the premodification rate which may include interest rate increases under the original contractual agreement with the borrower 

corporate loans 

in the corporate portfolios the allowance for loan losses includes an assetspecific component and a statistically based component the assetspecific component is calculated under asc 3101035 for largerbalance nonhomogeneous loans that are considered impaired an assetspecific allowance is established when the discounted cash flows collateral value less disposal costs or observable market price of the impaired loan are lower than its carrying value this allowance considers the borrower’s overall financial condition resources and payment record the prospects for support from any financially responsible guarantors discussed further below and if appropriate the realizable value of any collateral the assetspecific component of the allowance for smallerbalance impaired loans is calculated on a pool basis considering historical loss experience 

the allowance for the remainder of the loan portfolio is determined under asc 450 using a statistical methodology supplemented by management judgment the statistical analysis considers the portfolio’s size remaining tenor and credit quality as measured by internal risk ratings assigned to individual credit facilities which reflect probability of default and loss given default the statistical analysis considers historical default rates and historical loss severity in the event of default including historical average levels and historical variability the result is an estimated range for inherent losses the best estimate within the range is then determined by management’s quantitative and qualitative assessment of current conditions including general economic conditions specific industry and geographic trends and internal factors including portfolio concentrations trends in internal credit quality indicators and current and past underwriting standards 

for both the assetspecific and the statistically based components of the allowance for loan losses  management may incorporate guarantor support the financial wherewithal of the guarantor is evaluated as applicable based on net worth cash flow statements and personal or company financial statements which are updated and reviewed at least annually citi seeks performance on guarantee arrangements in the normal course of business seeking performance entails obtaining satisfactory cooperation from the guarantor or borrower in the specific situation this regular cooperation is indicative of pursuit and successful enforcement of the guarantee the exposure is reduced without the expense and burden of pursuing a legal remedy a guarantor’s reputation and willingness to work with citigroup are evaluated based on the historical experience with the guarantor and knowledge of the marketplace in the rare event that the guarantor is unwilling or unable to perform or facilitate borrower cooperation citi pursues a legal remedy however enforcing a guarantee via legal action against the guarantor is not the primary means of resolving a troubled loan situation and rarely occurs if citi does not pursue a legal remedy it is because citi does not believe that the guarantor has the financial wherewithal to perform regardless of legal action or because there are legal limitations on simultaneously pursuing guarantors and 

 

foreclosure a guarantor’s reputation does not impact citi’s decision or ability to seek performance under the guarantee 

in cases where a guarantee is a factor in the assessment of loan losses it is included via adjustment to the loan’s internal risk rating which in turn is the basis for the adjustment to the statistically based component of the allowance for loan losses  to date it is only in rare circumstances that an impaired commercial loan or commercial real estate loan is carried at a value in excess of the appraised value due to a guarantee 

when citi’s monitoring of the loan indicates that the guarantor’s wherewithal to pay is uncertain or has deteriorated there is either no change in the risk rating because the guarantor’s credit support was never initially factored in or the risk rating is adjusted to reflect that uncertainty or deterioration accordingly a guarantor’s ultimate failure to perform or a lack of legal enforcement of the guarantee does not materially impact the allowance for loan losses as there is typically no further significant adjustment of the loan’s risk rating at that time where citi is not seeking performance under the guarantee contract it provides for loan losses as if the loans were nonperforming and not guaranteed 

reserve estimates and policies 

management provides reserves for an estimate of probable losses inherent in the funded loan portfolio on the consolidated balance sheet in the form of an allowance for loan losses these reserves are established in accordance with citigroup’s credit reserve policies as approved by the audit committee of the citigroup board of directors citi’s chief risk officer and chief financial officer review the adequacy of the credit loss reserves each quarter with representatives from the risk management and finance staffs for each applicable business area applicable business areas include those having classifiably managed portfolios where internal creditrisk ratings are assigned primarily icg and gcb  or modified consumer loans where concessions were granted due to the borrowers’ financial difficulties 

the aforementioned representatives for these business areas present recommended reserve balances for their funded and unfunded lending portfolios along with supporting quantitative and qualitative data discussed below 

estimated probable losses for nonperforming nonhomogeneous exposures within a business line’s classifiably managed portfolio and impaired smallerbalance homogeneous loans whose terms have been modified due to the borrowers’ financial difficulties where it was determined that a concession was granted to the borrower consideration may be given to the following as appropriate when determining this estimate i the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s original effective rate ii the borrower’s overall financial condition resources and payment record and iii the prospects for support from financially responsible guarantors or the realizable value of any collateral in the determination of the allowance for loan losses for tdrs management considers a combination of historical redefault rates the current 

economic environment and the nature of the modification program when forecasting expected cash flows when impairment is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows the entire change in present value is recorded in provision for loan losses  

statistically calculated losses inherent in the classifiably managed portfolio for performing and de minimis nonperforming exposures the calculation is based on i citi’s internal system of creditrisk ratings which are analogous to the risk ratings of the major rating agencies and ii historical default and loss data including rating agency information regarding default rates from 1983 to 2017 and internal data dating to the early 1970s on severity of losses in the event of default adjustments may be made to this data such adjustments include i statistically calculated estimates to cover the historical fluctuation of the default rates over the credit cycle the historical variability of loss severity among defaulted loans and the degree to which there are large obligor concentrations in the global portfolio and ii adjustments made for specific known items such as current environmental factors and credit trends 

in addition representatives from each of the risk management and finance staffs who cover business areas with delinquencymanaged portfolios containing smallerbalance homogeneous loans present their recommended reserve balances based on leading credit indicators including loan delinquencies and changes in portfolio size as well as economic trends including current and future housing prices unemployment length of time in foreclosure costs to sell and gdp this methodology is applied separately for each individual product within each geographic region in which these portfolios exist 

this evaluation process is subject to numerous estimates and judgments the frequency of default risk ratings loss recovery rates the size and diversity of individual large credits and the ability of borrowers with foreign currency obligations to obtain the foreign currency necessary for orderly debt servicing among other things are all taken into account during this review changes in these estimates could have a direct impact on the credit costs in any period and could result in a change in the allowance 

allowance for unfunded lending commitments 

a similar approach to the allowance for loan losses is used for calculating a reserve for the expected losses related to unfunded lending commitments and standby letters of credit this reserve is classified on the consolidated balance sheet in other liabilities  changes to the allowance for unfunded lending commitments are recorded in provision for unfunded lending commitments  

 

mortgage servicing rights msrs 

mortgage servicing rights msrs are recognized as intangible assets when purchased or when the company sells or securitizes loans acquired through purchase or origination and retains the right to service the loans mortgage servicing rights are accounted for at fair value with changes in value recorded in other revenue in the company’s consolidated statement of income 

for additional information on the company’s msrs see notes 16 and 21 to the consolidated financial statements 

goodwill 

goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing and interim assessments between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would morelikelythannot reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 

under asc topic 350 intangibles—goodwill and other  the company has an option to assess qualitative factors to determine if it is necessary to perform the goodwill impairment test if after assessing the totality of events or circumstances the company determines that it is not morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount no further testing is necessary if however the company determines that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount then the company must perform the first step of the twostep goodwill impairment test 

the company has an unconditional option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any reporting period and proceed directly to the first step of the goodwill impairment test 

the first step requires a comparison of the fair value of the individual reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit is in excess of the carrying value the related goodwill is considered not impaired and no further analysis is necessary if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value this is an indication of potential impairment and the second step of testing is performed to measure the amount of impairment if any for that reporting unit 

if required the second step involves calculating the implied fair value of goodwill for each of the affected reporting units the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination which is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit determined in step one over the fair value of the net assets and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit were being acquired if the amount of the goodwill allocated to the reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill in the pro forma purchase price allocation an impairment charge is recorded for the excess a recognized impairment charge cannot exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to a reporting unit and cannot subsequently be reversed even if the fair value of the reporting unit recovers 

upon any business disposition goodwill is allocated to and derecognized with the disposed business based on the ratio of the fair value of the disposed business to the fair value of the reporting unit 

additional information on citi’s goodwill impairment testing can be found in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

intangible assets 

intangible assets— including core deposit intangibles present value of future profits purchased credit card relationships credit card contract related intangibles other customer relationships and other intangible assets but excluding msrs — are amortized over their estimated useful lives intangible assets that are deemed to have indefinite useful lives primarily trade names are not amortized and are subject to annual impairment tests an impairment exists if the carrying value of the indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds its fair value for other intangible assets subject to amortization an impairment is recognized if the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds the fair value of the intangible asset 

other assets and other liabilities 

other assets include among other items loans hfs deferred tax assets equity method investments interest and fees receivable lease rightofuse assets premises and equipment including purchased and developed software repossessed assets and other receivables other liabilities include among other items accrued expenses and other payables lease liabilities deferred tax liabilities and reserves for legal claims taxes unfunded lending commitments repositioning reserves and other matters 

other real estate owned and repossessed assets 

real estate or other assets received through foreclosure or repossession are generally reported in other assets  net of a valuation allowance for selling costs and subsequent declines in fair value 

securitizations 

there are two key accounting determinations that must be made relating to securitizations citi first makes a determination as to whether the securitization entity must be consolidated second it determines whether the transfer of financial assets to the entity is considered a sale under gaap if the securitization entity is a vie the company consolidates the vie if it is the primary beneficiary as discussed in “variable interest entities” above for all other securitization entities determined not to be vies in which citigroup participates consolidation is based on which party has voting control of the entity giving consideration to removal and liquidation rights in certain partnership structures only securitization entities controlled by citigroup are consolidated 

interests in the securitized and sold assets may be retained in the form of subordinated or senior interestonly strips subordinated tranches spread accounts and servicing rights in credit card securitizations the company retains a 

 

seller’s interest in the credit card receivables transferred to the trusts which is not in securitized form in the case of consolidated securitization entities including the credit card trusts these retained interests are not reported on citi’s consolidated balance sheet the securitized loans remain on 

the balance sheet substantially all of the consumer loans sold or securitized through nonconsolidated trusts by citigroup are us prime residential mortgage loans retained interests in nonconsolidated mortgage securitization trusts are classified as trading account assets  except for msrs which are included in intangible assets on citigroup’s consolidated balance sheet 

debt 

shortterm borrowings and longterm debt are accounted for at amortized cost except where the company has elected to report the debt instruments including certain structured notes at fair value or the debt is in a fair value hedging relationship 

transfers of financial assets 

for a transfer of financial assets to be considered a sale i the assets must be legally isolated from the company even in bankruptcy or other receivership ii the purchaser must have the right to pledge or sell the assets transferred or if the purchaser is an entity whose sole purpose is to engage in securitization and assetbacked financing activities through the issuance of beneficial interests and that entity is constrained from pledging the assets it receives each beneficial interest holder must have the right to sell or pledge their beneficial interests and iii the company may not have an option or obligation to reacquire the assets 

if these sale requirements are met the assets are removed from the company’s consolidated balance sheet if the conditions for sale are not met the transfer is considered to be a secured borrowing the assets remain on the consolidated balance sheet and the sale proceeds are recognized as the company’s liability a legal opinion on a sale generally is obtained for complex transactions or where the company has continuing involvement with assets transferred or with the securitization entity for a transfer to be eligible for sale accounting that opinion must state that the asset transfer would be considered a sale and that the assets transferred would not be consolidated with the company’s other assets in the event of the company’s insolvency 

for a transfer of a portion of a financial asset to be considered a sale the portion transferred must meet the definition of a participating interest a participating interest must represent a pro rata ownership in an entire financial asset all cash flows must be divided proportionately with the same priority of payment no participating interest in the transferred asset may be subordinated to the interest of another participating interest holder and no party may have the right to pledge or exchange the entire financial asset unless all participating interest holders agree otherwise the transfer is accounted for as a secured borrowing 

see note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

risk management activities—derivatives used for hedging purposes 

the company manages its exposures to market movements outside of its trading activities by modifying the asset and liability mix either directly or through the use of derivative financial products including interest rate swaps futures forwards and purchased options as well as foreignexchange contracts these enduser derivatives are carried at fair value in trading account assets and trading account liabilities  

see note 22 to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of the company’s hedging and derivative activities 

instrumentspecific credit risk 

citi presents separately in aoci the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrumentspecific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments accordingly the change in fair value of liabilities for which the fair value option was elected related to changes in citigroup’s own credit spreads is presented in aoci  

employee benefits expense 

employee benefits expense includes current service costs of pension and other postretirement benefit plans which are accrued on a current basis contributions and unrestricted awards under other employee plans the amortization of restricted stock awards and costs of other employee benefits 

for its most significant pension and postretirement benefit plans significant plans citigroup measures and discloses plan obligations plan assets and periodic plan expense quarterly instead of annually the effect of remeasuring the significant plan obligations and assets by updating plan actuarial assumptions on a quarterly basis is reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and periodic plan expense all other plans all other plans are remeasured annually see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

stockbased compensation 

the company recognizes compensation expense related to stock and option awards over the requisite service period generally based on the instruments’ grantdate fair value reduced by actual forfeitures as they occur compensation cost related to awards granted to employees who meet certain age plus yearsofservice requirements retirementeligible employees is accrued in the year prior to the grant date in the same manner as the accrual for cash incentive compensation certain stock awards with performance conditions or certain clawback provisions are subject to variable accounting pursuant to which the associated compensation expense fluctuates with changes in citigroup’s common stock price see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

income taxes 

the company is subject to the income tax laws of the us and its states and municipalities as well as the nonus jurisdictions in which it operates these tax laws are complex and may be subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities in establishing a provision for income tax expense the company must make judgments and interpretations about these tax laws the company must also make estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions both domestic and foreign 

disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be subject to review and adjudication by the court systems of the various tax jurisdictions or may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit the company treats interest and penalties on income taxes as a component of income tax expense  

deferred taxes are recorded for the future consequences of events that have been recognized in financial statements or tax returns based upon enacted tax laws and rates deferred tax assets are recognized subject to management’s judgment about whether realization is morelikelythannot asc 740 income taxes  sets out a consistent framework to determine the appropriate level of tax reserves to maintain for uncertain tax positions this interpretation uses a twostep approach wherein a tax benefit is recognized if a position is morelikelythannot to be sustained the amount of the benefit is then measured to be the highest tax benefit that is more than 50 likely to be realized asc 740 also sets out disclosure requirements to enhance transparency of an entity’s tax reserves 

see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for a further description of the company’s tax provision and related income tax assets and liabilities 

commissions underwriting and principal transactions 

commissions and fees revenues are recognized in income when earned underwriting revenues are recognized in income typically at the closing of the transaction principal transactions revenues are recognized in income on a tradedate basis see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the company’s revenue recognition policies for commissions and fees  and note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for details of principal transactions revenue 

earnings per share 

earnings per share eps is computed after deducting preferred stock dividends the company has granted restricted and deferred share awards with dividend rights that are considered to be participating securities which are akin to a second class of common stock accordingly a portion of citigroup’s earnings is allocated to those participating securities in the eps calculation 

basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders after the allocation of dividends and undistributed earnings to the participating securities by the weighted average number of 

common shares outstanding for the period diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised it is computed after giving consideration to the weighted average dilutive effect of the company’s stock options and warrants and convertible securities and after the allocation of earnings to the participating securities antidilutive options and warrants are disregarded in the eps calculations 

use of estimates 

management must make estimates and assumptions that affect the consolidated financial statements and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements such estimates are used in connection with certain fair value measurements see note 24 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussions on estimates used in the determination of fair value moreover estimates are significant in determining the amounts of otherthantemporary impairments impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets provisions for probable losses that may arise from creditrelated exposures and probable and estimable losses related to litigation and regulatory proceedings and income taxes while management makes its best judgment actual amounts or results could differ from those estimates 

cash flows 

cash equivalents are defined as those amounts included in cash and due from banks and predominately all of deposits with banks  cash flows from risk management activities are classified in the same category as the related assets and liabilities 

related party transactions 

the company has related party transactions with certain of its subsidiaries and affiliates these transactions which are primarily shortterm in nature include cash accounts collateralized financing transactions margin accounts derivative transactions charges for operational support and the borrowing and lending of funds and are entered into in the ordinary course of business 

accounting changes 

lease accounting 

in february 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201602 leases topic 842  which increases the transparency and comparability of accounting for lease transactions the asu requires lessees to recognize liabilities for operating leases and corresponding rightofuse rou assets on the balance sheet the asu also requires quantitative and qualitative disclosures regarding key information about leasing arrangements lessee accounting for finance leases as well as lessor accounting are largely unchanged 

effective january 1 2019 the company prospectively adopted the provisions of the asu at adoption citi recognized a lease liability and a corresponding rou asset of approximately  44 billion on the consolidated balance 

 

sheet related to its future lease payments as a lessee under operating leases in addition the company recorded a  151 million increase in retained earnings for the cumulative effect of recognizing previously deferred gains on saleleaseback transactions adoption of the asu did not have a material impact on the consolidated statement of income see notes 14 and 26 for additional details 

the company has elected not to separate lease and nonlease components in its lease contracts and accounts for them as a single lease component citi has also elected not to record an rou asset for shortterm leases that have a term of 12 months or less and do not contain purchase options that citi is reasonably certain to exercise the cost of shortterm leases is recognized in the consolidated statement of income on a straightline basis over the lease term in addition citi applies the portfolio approach to account for certain equipment leases with nearly identical contractual terms 

lessee accounting 

operating lease rou assets and lease liabilities are included in other assets and other liabilities  respectively on the consolidated balance sheet finance lease assets and liabilities are included in other assets and longterm debt  respectively on the consolidated balance sheet the company uses its incremental borrowing rate factoring in the lease term to determine the lease liability which is measured at the present value of future lease payments the rou asset is initially measured at the amount of the lease liability plus any prepaid rent and remaining initial direct costs less any remaining lease incentives and accrued rent the rou asset is subject to impairment during the lease term in a manner consistent with the impairment of longlived assets the lease terms include periods covered by options to extend or terminate the lease depending on whether citi is reasonably certain to exercise such options 

lessor accounting 

lessor accounting is largely unchanged under the asu citi acts as a lessor for power railcar shipping and aircraft assets where the company has executed operating direct financing and leveraged leasing arrangements in a direct financing or a leveraged lease citi derecognizes the leased asset and records a lease financing receivable at lease commencement in loans  upon lease termination citi may obtain control of the asset which is then recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet and any remaining receivable for the asset’s residual value is derecognized under the asu leveraged lease accounting is grandfathered and may continue to be applied until the leveraged lease is terminated or modified upon modification the lease must be classified as an operating direct finance or salestype lease in accordance with the asu 

separately as part of managing its real estate footprint citi subleases excess real estate space via operating lease arrangements 

sec staff accounting bulletin 118 

on december 22 2017 the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab 118 which set forth the accounting for the changes in tax law caused by the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act tax reform sab 118 provided guidance where the accounting under asc 740 was incomplete for certain income tax effects of tax reform at the time of the issuance of an entity’s financial statements for the period in which tax reform was enacted provisional items citi disclosed several provisional items recorded as part of its  226 billion fourth quarter 2017 charge related to tax reform 

citi completed its accounting for tax reform under sab 118 during the fourth quarter of 2018 and recorded a onetime noncash tax benefit of  94 million in corporateother related to amounts that were considered provisional pursuant to sab 118 the adjustments for the provisional amounts consisted of a  12 billion benefit relating to a reduction of the valuation allowance against citi’s ftc carryforwards and its us residual dtas related to its nonus branches offset by additional charges of  02 billion related to the impact of a change to a “quasiterritorial tax system” and  09 billion related to the impact of deemed repatriation of undistributed earnings of nonus subsidiaries 

also citi has made a policy election to account for taxes on global intangible low taxed income gilti as incurred 

revenue recognition 

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers revenue recognition which outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers the core principle of the revenue model is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services the asu defines the promised good or service as the performance obligation under the contract 

while the guidance replaces most existing revenue recognition guidance in gaap the asu is not applicable to financial instruments and therefore does not impact a majority of the company’s revenues including net interest income loan fees gains on sales and marktomarket accounting 

in accordance with the new revenue recognition standard citi has identified the specific performance obligation promised services associated with the contract with the customer and has determined when that specific performance obligation has been satisfied which may be at a point in time or over time depending on how the performance obligation is defined the contracts with customers also contain the transaction price which consists of fixed consideration andor consideration that may vary variable consideration and is defined as the amount of consideration an entity expects to be entitled to when or as the performance obligation is satisfied excluding amounts 

 

collected on behalf of third parties including transaction taxes the amounts recognized at the point in time the performance obligation is satisfied may differ from the ultimate transaction price associated with that performance obligation when a portion of it is based on variable consideration for example some consideration is based on the client’s monthend balance or market values which are unknown at the time the contract is executed the remaining transaction price amount if any will be recognized as the variable consideration becomes determinable in certain transactions the performance obligation is considered satisfied at a point in time in the future in this instance citi defers revenue on the balance sheet that will only be recognized upon completion of the performance obligation 

the new revenue recognition standard further clarified the guidance related to reporting revenue gross as principal versus net as an agent in many cases citi outsources a component of its performance obligations to third parties the company has determined that it acts as principal in the majority of these transactions and therefore presents the amounts paid to these third parties gross within operating expenses 

the company has retrospectively adopted this standard as of january 1 2018 and as a result was required to report amounts paid to third parties where citi is principal to the contract within operating expenses the adoption resulted in an increase in both revenue and expenses of approximately  1 billion for each of the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 with similar amounts for prior years prior to adoption these expense amounts were reported as contra revenue primarily within commissions and fees and administration and other fiduciary fees revenues accordingly prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the new presentation 

see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the company’s revenue recognition policies for commissions and fees and administration and other fiduciary fees  

income tax impact of intraentity transfers of assets 

in october 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201616 income taxes—intraentity transfers of assets other than inventory  which requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of an intraentity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs the asu was effective january 1 2018 and was adopted as of that date the impact of this standard was an increase of dtas by approximately  300 million  a decrease of retained earnings by approximately  80 million and a decrease of prepaid tax assets by approximately  380 million  

clarifying the definition of a business 

in january 2017 the fasb issued asu no 201701 business combinations topic 805 clarifying the definition of a business the definition of a business directly and indirectly affects many areas of accounting eg acquisitions disposals goodwill and consolidation the asu narrows the definition of a business by introducing a quantitative screen as the first step such that if substantially 

all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets then the set of transferred assets and activities is not a business if the set is not clarified from the quantitative screen the entity then evaluates whether the set meets the requirement that a business include at a minimum an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs 

citi adopted the asu upon its effective date on january 1 2018 prospectively the ongoing impact of the asu will depend upon the acquisition and disposal activities of citi if fewer transactions qualify as a business there could be less initial recognition of goodwill  but also less goodwill allocated to disposals there was no impact during 2018 from the adoption of this asu 

changes in accounting for pension and postretirement benefit expense 

in march 2017 the fasb issued asu no 201707 compensation—retirement benefits topic 715 improving the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost  which changes the income statement presentation of net benefit expense and requires restating the company’s financial statements for each of the earlier periods presented in citi’s annual and interim financial statements the change in presentation was effective for annual and interim periods starting january 1 2018 the asu requires that only the service cost component of net benefit expense be included in compensation and benefits on the income statement the other components of net benefit expense are required to be presented outside of compensation and benefits and are presented in other operating expenses  since both of these income statement line items are part of operating expenses  total operating expenses and net income will not change this change in presentation did not have a material effect on compensation and benefits and other operating expenses and was applied prospectively the components of the net benefit expense are disclosed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

the standard also changes the components of net benefit expense that are eligible for capitalization when employee costs are capitalized in connection with various activities such as internally developed software constructioninprogress and loan origination costs prospectively from january 1 2018 only the service cost component of net benefit expense may be capitalized existing capitalized balances are not affected this change in amounts eligible for capitalization does not have a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 

hedging 

in august 2017 the fasb issued asu no 201712 targeted improvements to accounting for hedging activities  which better aligns an entity’s risk management activities and financial reporting for hedging relationships through changes to the designation and measurement guidance for qualifying hedging relationships and the presentation of 

 

hedge results the asu requires the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument to be presented in the same income statement line as the hedged item and also requires expanded disclosures citi adopted this standard on january 1 2018 and transferred approximately  4 billion of prepayable mortgagebacked securities and municipal bonds from heldtomaturity htm into availableforsale afs securities classification as permitted as a onetime transfer upon adoption of the standard as these assets were deemed to be eligible to be hedged under the lastoflayer hedge strategy the impact to opening retained earnings was immaterial see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

statement of cash flows 

in november 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201618 restricted cash  which requires that companies present cash cash equivalents and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents restricted cash when reconciling beginningofperiod and endofperiod totals on the consolidated statement of cash flows in connection with the adoption of the asu citigroup also changed its definition of cash and cash equivalents to include all of cash and due from banks and predominately all of deposits with banks the company has retrospectively adopted this asu as of january 1 2018 and as a result net cash provided by investing activities of continuing operations on the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended december 31 2017 increased by  193 billion  

reclassification of certain tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income 

on february 14 2018 the fasb issued asu no 201802 reclassification of certain tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income  the asu allows a reclassification from aoci to retained earnings for the deferred taxes previously recorded in aoci that exceed the current federal tax rate of 21 resulting from the newly enacted corporate tax rate in tax reform and other stranded tax amounts related to the application of tax reform that citi elects to reclassify the asu allows adjustments to reclassification amounts in subsequent periods as a result of changes to the amounts recorded under sab 118 citi elected to early adopt the asu effective december 31 2017 which applied only to the period in which the effects related to the onetime tax reform charge were recognized in addition to the reclassification of deferred taxes recorded in aoci that exceed the current federal tax rate citi also reclassified amounts recorded in aoci related to the effects of the shift to a territorial system related to the application of tax reform using the portfolio method 

the effect of adopting the asu resulted in an increase of  33 billion to retained earnings at december 31 2017 due to the reclassification of aoci to retained earnings  

premium amortization on purchased callable 

debt securities 

in march 2017 the fasb issued asu no 201708 receivables—nonrefundable fees and other costs subtopic 31020 premium amortization on purchased callable debt securities  which amends the amortization period for certain purchased callable debt securities held at a premium the asu requires entities to amortize premiums on debt securities by the first call date when the securities have fixed and determinable call dates and prices the scope of the asu includes all accounting premiums such as purchase premiums and cumulative fair value hedge adjustments the asu does not change the accounting for discounts which continue to be recognized over the contractual life of a security 

citi early adopted the asu in the second quarter of 2017 with an effective date of january 1 2017 adoption of the asu is on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption adoption of the asu primarily affected citi’s afs and htm portfolios of callable state and municipal debt securities the asu adoption resulted in a net reduction to total stockholders’ equity of  156 million aftertax effective as of january 1 2017 this amount is composed of a reduction of approximately  660 million to retained earnings for the incremental amortization of purchase premiums and cumulative hedge adjustments generated under fair value hedges of these callable debt securities offset by an increase to aoci of  504 million related to the cumulative fair value hedge adjustments reclassified to retained earnings for afs debt securities

in august 2018 the fasb issued asu no 201813 fair value measurement topic 820 disclosure framework—changes to the disclosure requirements for fair value measurement the amendments modify certain disclosure requirements for fair value measurements and were effective january 1 2020 with early adoption permitted the company early adopted this asu as of december 31 2019 in its entirety with no material impact on the company 

future accounting changes 

accounting for financial instruments—credit losses 

overview 

in june 2016 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asu no 201613 financial instruments—credit losses topic 326 the asu introduces a new credit loss methodology the current expected credit losses cecl methodology which requires earlier recognition of credit losses while also providing additional transparency about credit risk citi adopted the asu as of january 1 2020 which as discussed below resulted in an increase in citi’s allowance for credit losses and a decrease to opening retained earnings  net of deferred income taxes at january 1 2020 

 

the cecl methodology utilizes a lifetime “expected credit loss” measurement objective for the recognition of credit losses for loans heldtomaturity debt securities receivables and other financial assets measured at amortized cost at the time the financial asset is originated or acquired the allowance for credit losses is adjusted each period for changes in expected lifetime credit losses the cecl methodology represents a significant change from prior us gaap and replaced the prior multiple existing impairment methods which generally required that a loss be incurred before it was recognized within the life cycle of a loan or other financial asset the methodology generally results in the earlier recognition of the provision for credit losses and the related allowance for credit losses than prior us gaap for availableforsale debt securities where fair value is less than cost that citi intends to hold or morelikelythannot will not be required to sell creditrelated impairment if any is recognized through an allowance for credit losses and adjusted each period for changes in credit risk 

january 1 2020 cecl transition day 1 impact 

the cecl methodology’s impact on expected credit losses among other things reflects citi’s view of the current state of the economy forecasted macroeconomic conditions and citi’s portfolios at the january 1 2020 date of adoption based on forecasts of macroeconomic conditions and exposures at that time the aggregate impact to citi was an approximate  41 billion  or an approximate 29   pretax increase in the allowance for credit losses  along with a  31 billion aftertax decrease in retained earnings and a deferred tax asset increase of  10 billion  this transition impact reflects i a  49 billion build to the allowance for credit losses for citi’s consumer exposures primarily driven by the impact on credit card receivables of longer estimated tenors under the cecl lifetime expected credit loss methodology loss coverage of approximately 23 months  compared to shorter estimated tenors under the probable loss methodology under prior us gaap loss coverage of approximately 14 months  net of recoveries and ii a release of  08 billion of reserves primarily related to citi’s corporate net loan loss exposures largely due to more precise contractual maturities that result in shorter remaining tenors incorporation of recoveries and use of more specific historical loss data based on an increase in portfolio segmentation across industries and geographies 

under the cecl methodology the allowance for credit losses consists of quantitative and qualitative components citi’s quantitative component of the allowance for credit losses is model based and utilizes a single forwardlooking macroeconomic forecast complemented by the qualitative component described below in estimating expected credit losses and discounts inputs for the corporate classifiably managed portfolios reasonable and supportable forecast periods vary by product for example citi’s consumer cards models use a 13quarter reasonable and supportable period and revert to historical loss experience thereafter while its corporate loan models use a ninequarter reasonable and supportable period followed by a threequarter graduated transition to historical loss experience 

citi’s qualitative component of the allowance for credit losses considers i the uncertainty of forwardlooking scenarios based on the likelihood and severity of a possible recession as another possible scenario ii certain portfolio characteristics such as portfolio concentration and collateral coverage and iii model limitations as well as idiosyncratic events 

subsequent measurement of goodwill 

in january 2017 the fasb issued asu no 201704 intangibles—goodwill and other topic 350 simplifying the test for goodwill impairment  the asu simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill impairment by eliminating the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill ie the current step 2 of the goodwill impairment test to measure a goodwill impairment charge under the asu the impairment test is the comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount the current step 1 with the impairment charge being the deficit in fair value but not exceeding the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit the simplified onestep impairment test applies to all reporting units including those with zero or negative carrying amounts 

the asu was adopted by citi as of january 1 2020 with prospective application the impact of the asu will depend upon the performance of citi’s reporting units and the market conditions impacting the fair value of each reporting unit going forward

7 incentive plans 

  

discretionary annual incentive awards 

citigroup grants immediate cash bonus payments and various forms of immediate and deferred awards as part of its discretionary annual incentive award program involving a large segment of citigroup’s employees worldwide most of the shares of common stock issued by citigroup as part of its equity compensation programs are issued to settle the vesting of the stock components of these awards 

discretionary annual incentive awards are generally awarded in the first quarter of the year based on the previous year’s performance awards valued at less than us  100000 or the local currency equivalent are generally paid entirely in the form of an immediate cash bonus pursuant to citigroup policy andor regulatory requirements certain employees and officers are subject to mandatory deferrals of incentive pay and generally receive 25  – 60  of their awards in a combination of restricted or deferred stock deferred cash stock units or deferred cash discretionary annual incentive awards to many employees in the eu are subject to deferral requirements regardless of the total award value with at least 50  of the immediate incentive delivered in the form of a stock payment award subject to a restriction on sale or transfer generally for 12 months 

deferred annual incentive awards may be delivered in the form of one or more award types a restricted or deferred stock award under citi’s capital accumulation program cap or a deferred cash stock unit award andor a deferred cash award under citi’s deferred cash award plan the applicable mix of awards may vary based on the employee’s minimum deferral requirement and the country of employment 

subject to certain exceptions principally for retirementeligible employees continuous employment within citigroup is required to vest in cap deferred cash stock unit and deferred cash awards post employment vesting by retirementeligible employees and participants who meet other conditions is generally conditioned upon their refraining from competition with citigroup during the remaining vesting period unless the employment relationship has been terminated by citigroup under certain conditions 

generally the deferred awards vest in equal annual installments over three  or four year periods vested cap awards are delivered in shares of common stock deferred cash awards are payable in cash and except as prohibited by applicable regulatory guidance earn a fixed notional rate of interest that is paid only if and when the underlying principal award amount vests deferred cash stock unit awards are payable in cash at the vesting value of the underlying stock generally in the eu vested cap shares are subject to a restriction on sale or transfer after vesting and vested deferred cash awards and deferred cash stock units are subject to hold back generally for 6 or 12 months based on the award type 

unvested cap deferred cash stock units and deferred cash awards are subject to one or more clawback provisions that apply in certain circumstances including gross misconduct cap and deferred cash stock unit awards made to certain employees are subject to a formulaic performancebased vesting condition pursuant to which amounts otherwise 

 

scheduled to vest will be reduced based on the amount of any pretax loss in the participant’s business in the calendar year preceding the scheduled vesting date a minimum reduction of 20  applies for the first dollar of loss for cap and deferred cash stock unit awards 

in addition deferred cash awards are subject to a discretionary performancebased vesting condition under which an amount otherwise scheduled to vest may be reduced in the event of a “material adverse outcome” for which a participant has “significant responsibility” these awards are also subject to an additional clawback provision pursuant to which unvested awards may be canceled if the employee engaged in misconduct or exercised materially imprudent judgment or failed to supervise or escalate the behavior of other employees who did 

signon and longterm retention awards 

stock awards and deferred cash awards may be made at various times during the year as signon awards to induce new hires to join citi or to highpotential employees as longterm retention awards 

vesting periods and other terms and conditions pertaining to these awards tend to vary by grant generally recipients must remain employed through the vesting dates to vest in the awards except in cases of death disability or involuntary termination other than for gross misconduct these awards do not usually provide for post employment vesting by retirementeligible participants 

outstanding unvested stock awards 

a summary of the status of unvested stock awards granted as discretionary annual incentive or signon and longterm retention awards is presented below 



  total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock awards was  538 million at december 31 2019 the cost is expected to be recognized over a weightedaverage period of 16 years  

performance share units 

certain executive officers were awarded a target number of performance share units psus each february from 2016 to 2019 for performance in the year prior to the award date 

the psus granted in february 2016 were earned over a three year performance period based on citigroup’s relative total shareholder return as compared to peers 

the psus granted in february 2017 2018 and 2019 are earned over a three year performance period based half on return on tangible common equity performance in the last year of the threeyear performance period and the remaining half on cumulative earnings per share over the threeyear performance period 

for all award years if the total shareholder return is negative over the three year performance period executives may earn no more than 100  of the target psus regardless of the extent to which citigroup outperforms peer firms the number of psus ultimately earned could vary from zero  if performance goals are not met to as much as 150  of target if performance goals are meaningfully exceeded 

for all award years the value of each psu is equal to the value of one share of citi common stock dividend equivalents will be accrued and paid on the number of earned psus after the end of the performance period 

psus are subject to variable accounting pursuant to which the associated value of the award will fluctuate with changes in citigroup’s stock price and the attainment of the specified performance goals for each award until the award is settled solely in cash after the end of the performance period the value of the award subject to the performance goals is estimated using a simulation model that incorporates multiple valuation assumptions including the probability of achieving the specified performance goals of each award the riskfree rate used in the model is based on the applicable us treasury yield curve other significant assumptions for the awards are as follows 



 

a summary of the performance share unit activity for 2019 is presented below 



 

psus granted in 2017 were equitably adjusted after the enactment of tax reform as required under the terms of those awards the adjustments were intended to reproduce the expected value of the awards immediately prior to the passage of tax reform the psus granted in 2016 were not impacted by tax reform

all outstanding stock options are fully vested with the related expense recognized as a charge to income in prior periods 

the following table presents information with respect to stock option activity under citigroup’s stock option programs 



the following table summarizes information about stock options outstanding under citigroup’s stock option programs at december 31 2019 



other variable incentive compensation 

citigroup has various incentive plans globally that are used to motivate and reward performance primarily in the areas of sales operational excellence and customer satisfaction participation in these plans is generally limited to employees who are not eligible for discretionary annual incentive awards other forms of variable compensation include monthly commissions paid to financial advisors and mortgage loan officers 

summary 

except for awards subject to variable accounting the total expense recognized for stock awards represents the grant date fair value of such awards which is generally recognized as a charge to income ratably over the vesting period other than for awards to retirementeligible employees and immediately vested awards whenever awards are made or are expected to be made to retirementeligible employees the charge to income is accelerated based on when the applicable conditions to retirement eligibility were or will be met if the employee is retirement eligible on the grant date or the award is vested at the grant date the entire expense is recognized in the year prior to grant 

recipients of citigroup stock awards generally do not have any stockholder rights until shares are delivered upon vesting or exercise or after the expiration of applicable required holding periods recipients of restricted or deferred stock awards and deferred cash stock unit awards however may except as prohibited by applicable regulatory guidance be entitled to receive or accrue dividends or dividendequivalent payments during the vesting period recipients of restricted stock awards generally are entitled to vote the shares in their award during the vesting period once a stock award 

 

vests the shares delivered to the participant are freely transferable unless they are subject to a restriction on sale or transfer for a specified period 

all equity awards granted since april 19 2005 have been made pursuant to stockholderapproved stock incentive plans that are administered by the personnel and compensation committee of the citigroup board of directors which is composed entirely of independent nonemployee directors 

at december 31 2019  approximately 297 million shares of citigroup common stock were authorized and available for grant under citigroup’s 2019 stock incentive plan the only plan from which equity awards are currently granted 

the 2019 stock incentive plan and predecessor plans permit the use of treasury stock or newly issued shares in connection with awards granted under the plans treasury shares were used to settle vestings from 2016 to 2019 and for the first quarter of 2020 except where local laws favor newly issued shares the use of treasury stock or newly issued shares to settle stock awards does not affect the compensation expense recorded in the consolidated statement of income for equity awards 

incentive compensation cost 

the following table shows components of compensation expense relating to certain of the incentive compensation programs described above 



  

8 retirement benefits 

pension and postretirement plans 

the company has several noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering certain us employees and has various defined benefit pension and termination indemnity plans covering employees outside the us 

the us qualified defined benefit plan was frozen effective january 1 2008 for most employees accordingly no additional compensationbased contributions have been credited to the cash balance portion of the plan for existing plan participants after 2007 however certain employees covered under the prior final pay plan formula continue to accrue benefits the company also offers postretirement health care and life insurance benefits to certain eligible us retired employees as well as to certain eligible employees outside the us 

the company also sponsors a number of noncontributory nonqualified pension plans these plans which are unfunded provide supplemental defined pension benefits to certain us 

 

employees with the exception of certain employees covered under the prior final pay plan formula the benefits under these plans were frozen in prior years 

the plan obligations plan assets and periodic plan expense for the company’s most significant pension and postretirement benefit plans significant plans are measured and disclosed quarterly instead of annually the significant plans captured approximately 90  of the company’s global pension and postretirement plan obligations as of december 31 2019  all other plans all other plans are measured annually with a december 31 measurement date 

net benefit expense 

the following table summarizes the components of net benefit expense recognized in the consolidated statement of income for the company’s pension and postretirement plans for significant plans and all other plans 



 

contributions 

the company’s funding practice for us and nonus pension and postretirement plans is generally to fund to minimum funding requirements in accordance with applicable local laws and regulations the company may increase its contributions above the minimum required contribution if appropriate in addition management has the ability to change its funding practices for the us pension plans there were no required minimum cash contributions for 2019 or 2018 

 

the following table summarizes the actual company contributions for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  as well as estimated expected company contributions for 2020 expected contributions are subject to change since contribution decisions are affected by various factors such as market performance tax considerations and regulatory requirements 



 

funded status and accumulated other comprehensive income aoci 

the following table summarizes the funded status and amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheet for the company’s pension and postretirement plans 

 

the following table shows the change in aoci related to the company’s pension postretirement and post employment plans 

  

at december 31 2019 and 2018 the aggregate projected benefit obligation pbo the aggregate accumulated benefit obligation abo and the aggregate fair value of plan assets are presented for all defined benefit pension plans with a pbo in excess of plan assets and for all defined benefit pension plans with an abo in excess of plan assets as follows 



 

plan assumptions 

the company utilizes a number of assumptions to determine plan obligations and expenses changes in one or a combination of these assumptions will have an impact on the company’s pension and postretirement pbo funded status and benefit expense changes in the plans’ funded status resulting from changes in the pbo and fair value of plan assets will have a corresponding impact on accumulated other comprehensive income loss  

the actuarial assumptions at the respective years ended december 31 in the table below are used to measure the yearend pbo and the net periodic benefit expense for the subsequent year period since citi’s significant plans are measured on a quarterly basis the yearend rates for those plans are used to calculate the net periodic benefit expense for the subsequent year’s first quarter 

as a result of the quarterly measurement process the net periodic benefit expense for the significant plans is calculated at each respective quarter end based on the preceding quarterend rates as shown below for the us and nonus pension and postretirement plans the actuarial assumptions for all other plans are measured annually 

certain assumptions used in determining pension and postretirement benefit obligations and net benefit expense for the company’s plans are shown in the following table 



 

 

 



  

discount rate 

the discount rates for the us pension and postretirement plans were selected by reference to a citigroupspecific analysis using each plan’s specific cash flows and compared with highquality corporate bond indices for reasonableness the discount rates for the nonus pension and postretirement plans are selected by reference to highquality corporate bond rates in countries that have developed corporate bond markets however where developed corporate bond markets do not exist the discount rates are selected by reference to local government bond rates with a premium added to reflect the additional risk for corporate bonds in certain countries 

effective december 31 2019 the established rounding convention is to the nearest 5 bps for all countries 

expected rate of return 

the company determines its assumptions for the expected rate of return on plan assets for its us pension and postretirement plans using a “building block” approach which focuses on ranges of anticipated rates of return for each asset class a weighted average range of nominal rates is then determined based on target allocations to each asset class market performance over a number of earlier years is evaluated covering a wide range of economic conditions to determine whether there are sound reasons for projecting any past trends 

the company considers the expected rate of return to be a longterm assessment of return expectations and does not anticipate changing this assumption unless there are significant changes in investment strategy or economic conditions this contrasts with the selection of the discount rate and certain other assumptions which are reconsidered annually or quarterly for the significant plans in accordance with gaap 

the expected rate of return for the us pension and postretirement plans was 670  at december 31 2019 and 2018 and 680  at december 31 2017 the expected return on assets reflects the expected annual appreciation of the plan assets and reduces the company’s annual pension expense the expected return on assets is deducted from the sum of service cost interest cost and other components of pension expense to arrive at the net pension benefit expense 

 

the following table shows the expected rates of return used in determining the company’s pension expense compared to the actual rate of return on plan assets during 2019 2018 and 2017 for the us pension and postretirement plans 



  

for the nonus pension plans pension expense for 2019 was reduced by the expected return of  281 million  compared with the actual return of  781 million  pension expense for 2018 and 2017 was reduced by expected returns of  291 million and  299 million  respectively 

mortality tables 

at december 31 2019 the company adopted the private retirement plans pri2012 mortality table and the mortality projection 2019 mp2019 projection table for the us plans 



  

sensitivities of certain key assumptions 

the following tables summarize the effect on pension expense 



the us qualified pension plan was frozen in 2008 and as a result most service cost has been eliminated the pension expense for the us qualified pension plan is driven primarily by interest cost rather than by service cost an increase in the discount rate generally increases pension expense 

for nonus pension plans that are not frozen in countries such as mexico the uk and south korea there is more service cost the pension expense for the nonus plans is driven by both service cost and interest cost an increase in the discount rate generally decreases pension expense due to the greater impact on service cost compared to interest cost 

since the us qualified pension plan was frozen most of the prospective service cost has been eliminated and the gainloss amortization period was changed to the life expectancy for inactive participants as a result pension expense for the us qualified pension plan is driven more by interest costs than service costs and an increase in the discount rate would increase pension expense while a decrease in the discount rate would decrease pension expense 

the following tables summarize the effect on pension expense 



 

  health care cost trend rate 

assumed health care cost trend rates were as follows 



interest crediting rate 

the company has cash balance plans and other plans with promised interest crediting rates for these plans the interest crediting rates are set in line with plan rules or country legislation and do not change with market conditions 



plan assets 

citigroup’s pension and postretirement plans’ asset allocations for the us plans and the target allocations by asset category based on asset fair values are as follows 



  

thirdparty investment managers and advisors provide their services to citigroup’s us pension and postretirement plans assets are rebalanced as the company’s pension plan investment committee deems appropriate citigroup’s investment strategy with respect to its assets is to maintain a globally diversified investment portfolio across several asset classes that when combined with citigroup’s contributions to 

 

the plans will maintain the plans’ ability to meet all required benefit obligations 

citigroup’s pension and postretirement plans’ weightedaverage asset allocations for the nonus plans and the actual ranges and the weightedaverage target allocations by asset category based on asset fair values are as follows 



 



 

fair value disclosure 

for information on fair value measurements including descriptions of levels 1 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy and the valuation methodology utilized by the company see notes 1 and 24 to the consolidated financial statements asu 201507 removed the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy investments for which fair value is measured using the nav per share practical expedient 

 

certain investments may transfer between the fair value hierarchy classifications during the year due to changes in valuation methodology and pricing sources 

plan assets by detailed asset categories and the fair value hierarchy are as follows 



 

 



  



level 3 rollforward 

the reconciliations of the beginning and ending balances during the year for level 3 assets are as follows 



  



  





  

investment strategy 

the company’s global pension and postretirement funds’ investment strategy is to invest in a prudent manner for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits to participants the investment strategies are targeted to produce a total return that when combined with the company’s contributions to the funds will maintain the funds’ ability to meet all required benefit obligations risk is controlled through diversification of asset types and investments in domestic and international equities fixed income securities and cash and shortterm investments the target asset allocation in most locations outside the us is primarily in equity and debt securities these allocations may vary by geographic region and country depending on the nature of applicable obligations and various other regional considerations the wide variation in the actual range of plan asset allocations for the funded nonus plans is a result of differing local statutory requirements and economic conditions for example in certain countries local law requires that all pension plan assets must be invested in fixed income investments government funds or localcountry securities 

  

significant concentrations of risk in plan assets 

the assets of the company’s pension plans are diversified to limit the impact of any individual investment the us qualified pension plan is diversified across multiple asset classes with publicly traded fixed income hedge funds publicly traded equity and real estate representing the most significant asset allocations investments in these four asset classes are further diversified across funds managers strategies vintages sectors and geographies depending on the specific characteristics of each asset class the pension assets for the company’s nonus significant plans are primarily invested in publicly traded fixed income and publicly traded equity securities 

 

oversight and risk management practices 

the framework for the company’s pension oversight process includes monitoring of retirement plans by plan fiduciaries andor management at the global regional or country level as appropriate independent risk management contributes to the risk oversight and monitoring for the company’s us qualified pension plan and nonus significant pension plans although the specific components of the oversight process are tailored to the requirements of each region country and plan the following elements are common to the company’s monitoring and risk management process 

  

 

estimated future benefit payments   

the company expects to pay the following estimated benefit payments in future years 



post employment plans 

the company sponsors us post employment plans that provide income continuation and health and welfare benefits to certain eligible us employees on longterm disability 

as of december 31 2019 and 2018 the plans’ funded status recognized in the company’s consolidated balance sheet was  38  million and  32  million  respectively the pretax amounts recognized in aoci as of december 31 2019 and 2018 were  15  million and  15  million  respectively 

the following table summarizes the components of net expense recognized in the consolidated statement of income for the company’s us post employment plans 



the following table summarizes certain assumptions used in determining the post employment benefit obligations and net benefit expense for the company’s us post employment plans 



 

defined contribution plans 

the company sponsors defined contribution plans in the us and in certain nonus locations all of which are administered in accordance with local laws the most significant defined contribution plan is the citi retirement savings plan formerly known as the citigroup 401k plan sponsored by the company in the us 

under the citi retirement savings plan eligible us employees received matching contributions of up to 6  of their eligible compensation for 2019 and 2018 subject to statutory limits in addition for eligible employees whose eligible compensation is  100000 or less a fixed contribution of up to 2  of eligible compensation is provided all company contributions are invested according to participants’ individual elections the following tables summarize the company contributions for the defined contribution plans 



9 income taxes 

income tax provision 

details of the company’s income tax provision are presented below 



 

  

 

tax rate 

the reconciliation of the federal statutory income tax rate to the company’s effective income tax rate applicable to income from continuing operations before noncontrolling interests and the cumulative effect of accounting changes for each of the periods indicated is as follows 



    

as set forth in the table above citi’s effective tax rate for 2019 was 185   the rate is lower than the 228  reported in 2018 primarily due to the general basket ftc valuation allowance release 

deferred income taxes 

deferred income taxes at december 31 related to the following 



unrecognized tax benefits 

the following is a rollforward of the company’s unrecognized tax benefits 



 

the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 that if recognized would affect citi’s tax expense are  06 billion   04 billion and  08 billion  respectively the remaining uncertain tax positions have offsetting amounts in other jurisdictions or are temporary differences 

interest and penalties not included in “unrecognized tax benefits” above are a component of provision for income taxes  



 

as of december 31 2019 citi was under audit by the internal revenue service and other major taxing jurisdictions around the world it is thus reasonably possible that significant changes in the gross balance of unrecognized tax benefits may occur within the next 12 months although citi does not expect such audits to result in amounts that would cause a significant change to its effective tax rate 

the following are the major tax jurisdictions in which the company and its affiliates operate and the earliest tax year subject to examination 



 

nonus earnings 

nonus pretax earnings approximated  167 billion in 2019  161 billion in 2018 and  137 billion in 2017 as a us corporation citigroup and its us subsidiaries are currently subject to us taxation on all nonus pretax earnings of nonus branches beginning in 2018 there is a separate foreign tax credit ftc basket for branches also dividends from a nonus subsidiary or affiliate are effectively exempt from us taxation the company provides income taxes on the book over tax basis differences of nonus subsidiaries except to the extent that such differences are indefinitely reinvested outside the us 

at december 31 2019  109 billion of basis differences of nonus entities was indefinitely invested compared to  155 billion at december 31 2018 at the existing tax rates additional taxes net of us ftcs of  41 billion would have to be provided if such assertions were reversed the decrease of  46 billion in basis differences from the prior year end was primarily due to a tax election to treat a contiguous country affiliate as a branch rather than a subsidiary 

income taxes are not provided for the company’s “savings bank base year bad debt reserves” that arose before 1988 because under current us tax rules such taxes will become payable only to the extent that such amounts are distributed in excess of limits prescribed by federal law at december 31 2019 the amount of the base year reserves 

totaled approximately  358 million subject to a tax of  75 million  

deferred tax assets 

as of december 31 2019 citi had a valuation allowance of  65 billion  composed of valuation allowances of  46 billion on its ftc carryforwards  08 billion on its us residual dta related to its nonus branches  10 billion on local nonus dtas and  01 billion on state net operating loss carryforwards the valuation allowance against ftcs results from the impact of the lower tax rate and the new separate ftc basket for nonus branches the absolute amount of citi’s posttax reformrelated valuation allowances may change in future years first the separate ftc basket for nonus branches may result in additional dtas for ftcs requiring a valuation allowance given that the local tax rate for these branches exceeds on average the us tax rate of 21 offset by expirations of carryforwards the valuation allowance for the branch basket ftcs was reduced from  44 billion to  35 billion  primarily as a result of the expiration of the 2009 ftc carryforward 

second in citi’s general basket for ftcs changes in the forecasted amount of income in us locations derived from sources outside the us as well as actions that citi may be able to take to enhance such income in addition to tax examination changes from prior years could alter the amount of valuation allowance that is needed against such ftcs the valuation allowance for the general basket decreased from  16 billion to  11 billion  the decrease consists of the following items citi committed to a plan to move a financing business involving nonus clients and its associated funding to the us the incremental foreign source income generated by this action over time will morelikelythannot enable usage of ftc carryforwards of  02 billion  in addition citi committed to a plan as part of the company’s liquidity management program to increase its ownership of certain types of nonus securities and to hold such securities in its us operations the incremental foreign source income generated by this action will morelikelythannot enable the usage of ftc carryforwards of another  02 billion  the remainder of the decrease in the valuation allowance in the general basket was the result of other increases in foreign source income of  03 billion of which  02 billion is considered discrete and  01 billion is related to changes in 2019 foreign source income partially offset by an increase of  02 billion relating to prior years’ tax return adjustments that increased ftcs and the corresponding valuation allowance the valuation allowance for us residual dta related to its nonus branches decreased from  17 billion to  08 billion primarily due to a tax election to convert a contiguous country subsidiary into a branch which resulted in  09 billion of us dtls offsetting nonus local dtas in addition the nonus local valuation allowance was reduced from  15 billion to  10 billion  primarily due to an expiration of nol carryforwards in a nonus jurisdiction the following table summarizes citi’s dtas 

 



  

 

the following table summarizes the amounts of tax carryforwards and their expiration dates 



 

 

the time remaining for utilization of the ftc component has shortened given the passage of time although realization is not assured citi believes that the realization of the recognized net dtas of  231 billion at december 31 2019 is morelikelythannot based upon expectations as to future taxable income in the jurisdictions in which the dtas arise and consideration of available tax planning strategies as defined in asc 740 income taxes  

citi believes the us federal and new york state and city nol carryforward period of 20 years provides enough time to fully utilize the dtas pertaining to the existing nol carryforwards this is due to citi’s forecast of sufficient us taxable income and the fact that new york state and city continue to tax citi’s nonus income 

with respect to the ftcs component of the dtas the carryforward period is 10 years utilization of ftcs in any year is generally limited to 21  of foreign source taxable income in that year however overall domestic losses that citi has incurred of approximately  39 billion as of december 31 2019 are allowed to be reclassified as foreign source income to the extent of 50 – 100  at taxpayer’s election of domestic source income produced in subsequent years such resulting foreign source income would substantially cover the ftc carryforwards after valuation allowance as noted in the tables above citi’s ftc carryforwards were  63 billion   109 billion before valuation allowance as of december 31 2019 compared to  68 billion as of december 31 2018 citi believes that it will generate sufficient us taxable income within the 10year carryforward period to be able to utilize the net ftcs after the valuation allowance after considering any ftcs produced in the tax return for such period which must be used prior to any carryforward utilization 

10 earnings per share 

the following table reconciles the income and share data used in the basic and diluted earnings per share eps computations 



  

11 securities borrowed loaned and subject to repurchase agreements 

securities borrowed and purchased under agreements to resell  at their respective carrying values consisted of the following 



securities loaned and sold under agreements to repurchase  at their respective carrying values consisted of the following 



 

the resale and repurchase agreements represent collateralized financing transactions citi executes these transactions primarily through its brokerdealer subsidiaries to facilitate customer matchedbook activity and to efficiently fund a portion of citi’s trading inventory transactions executed by citi’s bank subsidiaries primarily facilitate customer financing activity 

to maintain reliable funding under a wide range of market conditions including under periods of stress citi manages these activities by taking into consideration the quality of the underlying collateral and stipulating financing tenor citi manages the risks in its collateralized financing transactions by conducting daily stress tests to account for changes in capacity tenors haircut collateral profile and client actions in addition citi maintains counterparty diversification by establishing concentration triggers and assessing counterparty reliability and stability under stress 

it is the company’s policy to take possession of the underlying collateral monitor its market value relative to the amounts due under the agreements and when necessary require prompt transfer of additional collateral in order to maintain contractual margin protection for resale and repurchase agreements when necessary the company posts additional collateral in order to maintain contractual margin protection 

 

collateral typically consists of government and governmentagency securities corporate and municipal bonds equities and mortgage and other assetbacked securities 

the resale and repurchase agreements are generally documented under industry standard agreements that allow the prompt closeout of all transactions including the liquidation of securities held and the offsetting of obligations to return cash or securities by the nondefaulting party following a payment default or other type of default under the relevant master agreement events of default generally include i failure to deliver cash or securities as required under the transaction ii failure to provide or return cash or securities as used for margining purposes iii breach of representation iv crossdefault to another transaction entered into among the parties or in some cases their affiliates and v a repudiation of obligations under the agreement the counterparty that receives the securities in these transactions is generally unrestricted in its use of the securities with the exception of transactions executed on a triparty basis where the collateral is maintained by a custodian and operational limitations may restrict its use of the securities 

a substantial portion of the resale and repurchase agreements is recorded at fair value as described in notes 24 and 25 to the consolidated financial statements the remaining portion is carried at the amount of cash initially advanced or received plus accrued interest as specified in the respective agreements 

the securities borrowing and lending agreements also represent collateralized financing transactions similar to the resale and repurchase agreements collateral typically consists of government and governmentagency securities and corporate debt and equity securities 

similar to the resale and repurchase agreements securities borrowing and lending agreements are generally documented under industry standard agreements that allow the prompt closeout of all transactions including the liquidation of securities held and the offsetting of obligations to return cash or securities by the nondefaulting party following a payment default or other default by the other party under the relevant master agreement events of default and rights to use securities under the securities borrowing and lending agreements are similar to the resale and repurchase agreements referenced above 

a substantial portion of securities borrowing and lending agreements is recorded at the amount of cash advanced or received the remaining portion is recorded at fair value as the company elected the fair value option for certain securities borrowed and loaned portfolios as described in note 25 to the consolidated financial statements with respect to securities loaned the company receives cash collateral in an amount generally in excess of the market value of the securities loaned the company monitors the market value of securities borrowed and securities loaned on a daily basis and obtains or posts additional collateral in order to maintain contractual margin protection 

the enforceability of offsetting rights incorporated in the master netting agreements for resale and repurchase agreements and securities borrowing and lending agreements is evidenced to the extent that i a supportive legal opinion 

has been obtained from counsel of recognized standing that provides the requisite level of certainty regarding the enforceability of these agreements and ii the exercise of rights by the nondefaulting party to terminate and close out transactions on a net basis under these agreements will not be stayed or avoided under applicable law upon an event of default including bankruptcy insolvency or similar proceeding 

a legal opinion may not have been sought or obtained for certain jurisdictions where local law is silent or sufficiently ambiguous to determine the enforceability of offsetting rights or where adverse case law or conflicting regulation may cast doubt on the enforceability of such rights in some jurisdictions and for some counterparty types the insolvency law for a particular counterparty type may be nonexistent or 

 

unclear as overlapping regimes may exist for example this may be the case for certain sovereigns municipalities central banks and us pension plans 

the following tables present the gross and net resale and repurchase agreements and securities borrowing and lending 

agreements and the related offsetting amounts permitted under asc 2102045 the tables also include amounts related to financial instruments that are not permitted to be offset under asc 2102045 but would be eligible for offsetting to the extent that an event of default has occurred and a legal opinion supporting enforceability of the offsetting rights has been obtained remaining exposures continue to be secured by financial collateral but the company may not have sought or been able to obtain a legal opinion evidencing enforceability of the offsetting right 









  

the following tables present the gross amounts of liabilities associated with repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements by remaining contractual maturity 





the following tables present the gross amounts of liabilities associated with repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements by class of underlying collateral 





12 brokerage receivables and brokerage 

payables 

the company has receivables and payables for financial instruments sold to and purchased from brokers dealers and customers which arise in the ordinary course of business citi is exposed to risk of loss from the inability of brokers dealers or customers to pay for purchases or to deliver the financial instruments sold in which case citi would have to sell or purchase the financial instruments at prevailing market prices credit risk is reduced to the extent that an exchange or clearing organization acts as a counterparty to the transaction and replaces the broker dealer or customer in question 

citi seeks to protect itself from the risks associated with customer activities by requiring customers to maintain margin collateral in compliance with regulatory and internal guidelines margin levels are monitored daily and customers deposit additional collateral as required where customers cannot meet collateral requirements citi may liquidate sufficient underlying financial instruments to bring the customer into compliance with the required margin level 

exposure to credit risk is impacted by market volatility which may impair the ability of clients to satisfy their obligations to citi credit limits are established and closely monitored for customers and for brokers and dealers engaged in forwards futures and other transactions deemed to be credit sensitive 

brokerage receivables and brokerage payables consisted of the following 





13 investments 

the following table presents citi’s investments by category 

  

the following table presents interest and dividend income on investments 



the following table presents realized gains and losses on the sales of investments which exclude otti losses 



the company from time to time may sell certain debt securities that were classified as htm these sales were in response to significant deterioration in the creditworthiness of the issuers or securities or because the company has collected a substantial portion at least 85   of the principal outstanding at acquisition of the security in addition certain other debt securities were reclassified to afs investments in 

 

response to significant credit deterioration because the company generally intends to sell these reclassified debt securities citi recorded otti on the securities the following table presents for the periods indicated the carrying value of htm debt securities sold and reclassified to afs as well as the related gain loss or the otti losses recorded on these securities 



debt securities availableforsale 

the amortized cost and fair value of afs debt securities were as follows 



 

at december 31 2019  the amortized cost of fixed income securities exceeded their fair value by  1113 million  of the  1113 million   802 million represented unrealized losses on fixed income investments that have been in a grossunrealizedloss position for less than a year and of these 93  were rated investment grade and  311 million represented unrealized losses on fixed income investments that have been in a grossunrealizedloss position for a year or more and of these 92  were rated investment grade of the  311 million mentioned above  132 million represents us treasury securities

the following table presents the amortized cost and fair value of afs debt securities by contractual maturity dates 



  

debt securities heldtomaturity 

the carrying value and fair value of debt securities htm were as follows 



 

the company has the positive intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity or where applicable to exercise any issuer call options absent any unforeseen significant changes in circumstances including deterioration in credit or changes in regulatory capital requirements 

the net unrealized losses classified in aoci for htm securities primarily relate to debt securities previously classified as afs that were transferred to htm and include any cumulative fair value hedge adjustments the net unrealized loss amount also includes any noncreditrelated changes in fair value of htm debt securities that have suffered credit impairment recorded in earnings the aoci balance related to htm debt securities is amortized as an adjustment of yield in a manner consistent with the accretion of any difference between the carrying value at the transfer date and par value of the same debt securities 

the table below shows the fair value of debt securities htm that have been in an unrecognized loss position 



note excluded from the gross unrecognized losses presented in the above table are  582  million and  653  million of net unrealized losses recorded in aoci as of december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively primarily related to the difference between the amortized cost and carrying value of htm debt securities that were reclassified from afs substantially all of these net unrecognized losses relate to securities that have been in a loss position for 12 months or longer at december 31 2019 and 2018 

the following table presents the carrying value and fair value of htm debt securities by contractual maturity dates 

  

evaluating investments for otherthantemporary impairment otti 

debt securities 

overview 

the company conducts periodic reviews of all debt securities with unrealized losses to evaluate whether the impairment is otherthantemporary this review applies to all debt securities that are not measured at fair value through earnings effective january 1 2018 the afs category was eliminated for equity securities and therefore otherthantemporary impairment otti review is not required for those securities 

an unrealized loss exists when the current fair value of an individual debt security is lower than its adjusted amortized cost basis unrealized losses that are determined to be temporary in nature are recorded net of tax in aoci for afs debt securities temporary losses related to htm debt securities generally are not recorded as these investments are carried at adjusted amortized cost basis however for htm debt securities with creditrelated impairment the credit loss is recognized in earnings as otti and any difference between the cost basis adjusted for the otti and fair value is recognized in aoci and amortized as an adjustment of yield over the remaining contractual life of the security for debt securities transferred to htm from trading account assets  amortized cost is defined as the fair value of the securities at the date of transfer plus any accretion income and less any impairment recognized in earnings subsequent to transfer for debt securities transferred to htm from afs amortized cost is defined as the original purchase cost adjusted for the cumulative accretion or amortization of any purchase discount or premium plus or minus any cumulative fair value hedge adjustments net of accretion or amortization and less any impairment recognized in earnings 

regardless of the classification of debt securities as afs or htm the company assesses each position with an unrealized loss for otti factors considered in determining whether a loss is temporary include 

 

the company’s review for impairment generally entails 

 

 

temporary impairment and those that would not support otherthantemporary impairment and 

 

the entire difference between amortized cost basis and fair value is recognized in earnings as otti for impaired debt securities that the company has an intent to sell or for which the company believes it will morelikelythannot be required to sell prior to recovery of the amortized cost basis however for those debt securities that the company does not intend to sell and is not likely to be required to sell only the creditrelated impairment is recognized in earnings and any noncreditrelated impairment is recorded in aoci  

for debt securities credit impairment exists where management does not expect to receive contractual principal and interest cash flows sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis of a security 

the sections below describe the company’s process for identifying creditrelated impairments for debt security types that have the most significant unrealized losses as of december 31 2019  

mortgagebacked securities 

for us mortgagebacked securities credit impairment is assessed using a cash flow model that estimates the principal and interest cash flows on the underlying mortgages using the securityspecific collateral and transaction structure the model distributes the estimated cash flows to the various tranches of securities considering the transaction structure and any subordination and credit enhancements that exist in that structure the cash flow model incorporates actual cash flows on the mortgagebacked securities through the current period and then estimates the remaining cash flows using a number of assumptions including default rates prepayment rates recovery rates on foreclosed properties and loss severity rates on nonagency mortgagebacked securities 

management develops specific assumptions using market data internal estimates and estimates published by rating agencies and other thirdparty sources default rates are projected by considering current underlying mortgage loan performance generally assuming the default of i 10  of current loans ii 25  of 30 – 59 day delinquent loans iii 70  of 60 – 90 day delinquent loans and iv 100  of 91  day delinquent loans these estimates are extrapolated along a default timing curve to estimate the total lifetime pool default rate other assumptions contemplate the actual collateral attributes including geographic concentrations rating actions and current market prices 

cash flow projections are developed using different stress test scenarios management evaluates the results of those stress tests including the severity of any cash shortfall indicated and the likelihood of the stress scenarios actually occurring based on the underlying pool’s characteristics and performance to assess whether management expects to recover the amortized cost basis of the security if cash flow projections indicate that the company does not expect to recover its amortized cost basis the company recognizes the estimated credit loss in earnings 

state and municipal securities 

the process for identifying credit impairments in citigroup’s afs and htm state and municipal bonds is primarily based on a credit analysis that incorporates thirdparty credit ratings citigroup monitors the bond issuers and any insurers providing default protection in the form of financial guarantee insurance the average external credit rating ignoring any insurance is aa3aa in the event of an external rating downgrade or other indicator of credit impairment ie based on instrumentspecific estimates of cash flows or probability of issuer default the subject bond is specifically reviewed for adverse changes in the amount or timing of expected contractual principal and interest payments 

for state and municipal bonds with unrealized losses that citigroup plans to sell or would be morelikelythannot required to sell the full impairment is recognized in earnings 

 

equity method investments 

management assesses equity method investments that have fair values that are lower than their respective carrying values for otti fair value is measured as price multiplied by quantity if the investee has publicly listed securities if the investee is not publicly listed other methods are used see note 24 to the consolidated financial statements 

for impaired equity method investments that citi plans to sell prior to recovery of value or would morelikelythannot be required to sell with no expectation that the fair value will recover prior to the expected sale date the full impairment is recognized in earnings as otti regardless of severity and duration the measurement of the otti does not include partial projected recoveries subsequent to the balance sheet date 

for impaired equity method investments that management does not plan to sell and is not morelikelythannot to be required to sell prior to recovery of value the evaluation of whether an impairment is otherthantemporary is based on i whether and when an equity method investment will recover in value and ii whether the investor has the intent and ability to hold that investment for a period of time sufficient to recover the value the determination of whether the impairment is considered otherthantemporary considers the following indicators 

 

recognition and measurement of otti 

the following tables present total otti on investments recognized in earnings 





 



 

the following are 12month rollforwards of the creditrelated impairments recognized in earnings for afs and htm debt securities that the company does not intend to sell nor likely will be required to sell 





 

nonmarketable equity securities not carried at 

fair value 

nonmarketable equity securities are required to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings unless i the measurement alternative is elected or ii the investment represents federal reserve bank and federal home loan bank stock or certain exchange seats that continue to be carried at cost see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details 

the election to measure a nonmarketable equity security using the measurement alternative is made on an instrumentbyinstrument basis under the measurement alternative an equity security is carried at cost plus or minus changes resulting from observable prices in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer the carrying value of the equity security is adjusted to fair value on the date of an observed transaction fair value may differ from the observed transaction price due to a number of factors including marketability adjustments and differences in rights and obligations when the observed transaction is not for the identical investment held by citi 

equity securities under the measurement alternative are also assessed for impairment on a quarterly basis management qualitatively assesses whether each equity security under the measurement alternative is impaired impairment indicators that are considered include but are not limited to the following 

 

 

when the qualitative assessment indicates that impairment exists the investment is written down to fair value with the full difference between the fair value of the investment and its carrying amount recognized in earnings 

below is the carrying value of nonmarketable equity securities measured using the measurement alternative at december 31 2019 and 2018 



below are amounts recognized in earnings and lifetodate amounts for nonmarketable equity securities measured using the measurement alternative 



 



a similar impairment analysis is performed for nonmarketable equity securities carried at cost for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 there was no impairment loss recognized in earnings for nonmarketable equity securities carried at cost 

investments in alternative investment funds that calculate net asset value 

the company holds investments in certain alternative investment funds that calculate net asset value nav or its equivalent including private equity funds funds of funds and real estate funds as provided by thirdparty asset managers investments in such funds are generally classified as nonmarketable equity securities carried at fair value the fair values of these investments are estimated using the nav of the company’s ownership interest in the funds some of these investments are in “covered funds” for purposes of the 

 

volcker rule which prohibits certain proprietary investment activities and limits the ownership of and relationships with covered funds on april 21 2017 citi’s request for extension of the permitted holding period under the volcker rule for certain of its investments in illiquid funds was approved allowing the company to hold such investments until the earlier of five years from the july 21 2017 expiration date of the general conformance period or the date such investments mature or are otherwise conformed with the volcker rule 



  

14 loans 

citigroup loans are reported in two categories consumer and corporate these categories are classified primarily according to the segment and subsegment that manage the loans 

consumer loans 

consumer loans represent loans and leases managed primarily by gcb and corporateother 

citigroup has established a risk management process to monitor evaluate and manage the principal risks associated with its consumer loan portfolio credit quality indicators that are actively monitored include delinquency status consumer credit scores under fair isaac corporation fico and loan to value ltv ratios each as discussed in more detail below 

included in the loan table above are lending products whose terms may give rise to greater credit issues credit cards with belowmarket introductory interest rates and interestonly loans are examples of such products these products are closely managed using credit techniques that are intended to mitigate their higher inherent risk 

delinquency status 

delinquency status is monitored and considered a key indicator of credit quality of consumer loans principally the us residential first mortgage loans use the mortgage bankers association mba method of reporting delinquencies which considers a loan delinquent if a monthly payment has not been received by the end of the day immediately preceding the loan’s next due date all other loans use a method of reporting delinquencies that considers a loan delinquent if a monthly payment has not been received by the close of business on the loan’s next due date 

as a general policy residential first mortgages home equity loans and installment loans are classified as nonaccrual when loan payments are 90 days contractually past due credit cards and unsecured revolving loans generally accrue interest until payments are 180 days past due home equity loans in regulated bank entities are classified as nonaccrual if the related residential first mortgage is 90 days or more past due mortgage loans other than federal housing administration fhainsured loans are classified as nonaccrual within 60 days of notification that the borrower has filed for bankruptcy 

the policy for reaging modified us consumer loans to current status varies by product generally one of the conditions to qualify for these modifications is that a minimum number of payments typically ranging from one to three  be made upon modification the loan is reaged to current status however reaging practices for certain openended consumer loans such as credit cards are governed by federal financial institutions examination council ffiec guidelines for openended consumer loans subject to ffiec guidelines one of the conditions for a loan to be reaged to current status is that at least three consecutive minimum monthly payments or the equivalent amount must be received in addition under ffiec guidelines the number of times that such a loan can be reaged is subject to limitations generally once in 12 months and twice in five years furthermore fha and department of veterans affairs va 

 

loans are modified under those respective agencies’ guidelines and payments are not always required in order to reage a modified loan to current

during the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  the company sold andor reclassified to hfs  29 billion and  32 billion  respectively of consumer loans 

consumer credit scores fico 

in the us independent credit agencies rate an individual’s risk for assuming debt based on the individual’s credit history and assign every consumer a fico credit score these scores are continually updated by the agencies based upon an individual’s credit actions eg taking out a loan or missed or late payments 

the following tables provide details on the fico scores for citi’s us consumer loan portfolio based on endofperiod receivables fico scores are updated monthly for substantially all of the portfolio or otherwise on a quarterly basis for the remaining portfolio 





  

 

loan to value ltv ratios 

ltv ratios loan balance divided by appraised value are calculated at origination and updated by applying market price data 

the following tables provide details on the ltv ratios for citi’s us consumer mortgage portfolios ltv ratios are updated monthly using the most recent core logic home price index data available for substantially all of the portfolio applied at the metropolitan statistical area level if available or the state level if not the remainder of the portfolio is updated in a similar manner using the federal housing finance agency indices 





  

impaired consumer loans 

a loan is considered impaired when citi believes it is probable that all amounts due according to the original contractual terms of the loan will not be collected impaired consumer loans include nonaccrual loans as well as smallerbalance homogeneous loans whose terms have been modified due to the borrower’s financial difficulties and where citi has granted a concession to the borrower these modifications may 

 

include interest rate reductions andor principal forgiveness impaired consumer loans exclude smallerbalance homogeneous loans that have not been modified and are carried on a nonaccrual basis

lease financing 

citi is a lessor in the power railcars shipping and aircraft sectors where the company has executed operating direct financing and leveraged leases citi’s  14 billion of lease financing receivables as of december 31 2019 is composed of approximately equal balances of direct financing lease receivables and net investments in leveraged leases citi uses the interest rate implicit in the lease to determine the present value of its lease financing receivables interest income on direct financing and leveraged leases during the year ended december 31 2019 was not material 

the company’s leases have an average remaining maturity of approximately three and a half years in certain cases citi obtains residual value insurance from third parties andor the lessee to manage the risk associated with the residual value of the leased assets the receivable related to the residual value of the leased assets is  09 billion as of december 31 2019 while the amount covered by residual value guarantees is  03 billion  

the company’s operating leases where citi is a lessor are not significant to the consolidated financial statements 

delinquency status 

citi generally does not manage corporate loans on a delinquency basis corporate loans are identified as impaired and placed on a cash nonaccrual basis when it is determined based on actual experience and a forwardlooking assessment of the collectability of the loan in full that the payment of interest or principal is doubtful or when interest or principal is 90 days past due except when the loan is well collateralized and in the process of collection any interest accrued on impaired corporate loans and leases is reversed at 90 days and charged against current earnings and interest is thereafter included in earnings only to the extent actually received in cash when there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectability of principal all cash receipts are thereafter applied to reduce the recorded investment in the loan while corporate loans are generally managed based on their internally assigned risk rating see further discussion below the following tables present delinquency information by corporate loan type 

corporate loan delinquencies and nonaccrual details at december 31 2019 

corporate loan delinquencies and nonaccrual details at december 31 2018 

  

citigroup has a risk management process to monitor evaluate and manage the principal risks associated with its corporate loan portfolio as part of its risk management process citi assigns numeric risk ratings to its corporate loan facilities based on quantitative and qualitative assessments of the obligor and facility these risk ratings are reviewed at least annually or more often if material events related to the obligor or facility warrant factors considered in assigning the risk ratings include financial condition of the obligor qualitative assessment of management and strategy amount and sources of repayment amount and type of collateral and guarantee arrangements amount and type of any contingencies associated with the obligor and the obligor’s industry and geography 

the obligor risk ratings are defined by ranges of default probabilities the facility risk ratings are defined by ranges of loss norms which are the product of the probability of default and the loss given default the investment grade rating categories are similar to the category bbbbaa3 and above as defined by sp and moody’s loans classified according to the bank regulatory definitions as special mention substandard and doubtful will have risk ratings within the noninvestmentgrade categories 

 

corporate loans credit quality indicators 



  

 

impaired collateraldependent loans and leases where repayment is expected to be provided solely by the sale of the underlying collateral and there are no other available and reliable sources of repayment are written down to the lower of carrying value or collateral value less cost to sell cashbasis loans are returned to an accrual status when all contractual principal and interest amounts are reasonably assured of repayment and there is a sustained period of repayment performance generally six months  in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan

21 securitizations and variable interest entities 

  

uses of special purpose entities 

a special purpose entity spe is an entity designed to fulfill a specific limited need of the company that organized it the principal uses of spes by citi are to obtain liquidity and favorable capital treatment by securitizing certain financial assets to assist clients in securitizing their financial assets and to create investment products for clients spes may be organized in various legal forms including trusts partnerships or corporations in a securitization through the spe’s issuance of debt and equity instruments certificates commercial paper or other notes of indebtedness the company transferring assets to the spe converts all or a portion of those assets into cash before they would have been realized in the normal course of business these issuances are recorded on the balance sheet of the spe which may or may not be consolidated onto the balance sheet of the company that organized the spe 

investors usually have recourse only to the assets in the spe but may also benefit from other credit enhancements such as a collateral account a line of credit or a liquidity facility such as a liquidity put option or asset purchase agreement because of these enhancements the spe issuances typically obtain a more favorable credit rating than the transferor could obtain for its own debt issuances this results in less expensive financing costs than unsecured debt the spe may also enter into derivative contracts in order to convert the yield or currency of the underlying assets to match the needs of the spe investors or to limit or change the credit risk of the spe citigroup may be the provider of certain credit enhancements as well as the counterparty to any related derivative contracts 

most of citigroup’s spes are variable interest entities vies as described below 

  

variable interest entities 

vies are entities that have either a total equity investment that is insufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or whose equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest ie ability to make significant decisions through voting rights or similar rights and a right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity or an obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity investors that finance the vie through debt or equity interests or other counterparties providing other forms of support such as guarantees certain fee arrangements or certain types of derivative contracts are variable interest holders in the entity 

 

the variable interest holder if any that has a controlling financial interest in a vie is deemed to be the primary beneficiary and must consolidate the vie citigroup would be deemed to have a controlling financial interest and be the primary beneficiary if it has both of the following characteristics 

 

the company must evaluate each vie to understand the purpose and design of the entity the role the company had in the entity’s design and its involvement in the vie’s ongoing activities the company then must evaluate which activities most significantly impact the economic performance of the vie and who has the power to direct such activities 

for those vies where the company determines that it has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the vie’s economic performance the company must then evaluate its economic interests if any and determine whether it could absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the vie when evaluating whether the company has an obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant it considers the maximum exposure to such loss without consideration of probability such obligations could be in various forms including but not limited to debt and equity investments guarantees liquidity agreements and certain derivative contracts 

in various other transactions the company may i act as a derivative counterparty for example interest rate swap crosscurrency swap or purchaser of credit protection under a credit default swap or total return swap where the company pays the total return on certain assets to the spe ii act as underwriter or placement agent iii provide administrative trustee or other services or iv make a market in debt securities or other instruments issued by vies the company generally considers such involvement by itself not to be variable interests and thus not an indicator of power or potentially significant benefits or losses 

citigroup’s involvement with consolidated and unconsolidated vies with which the company holds significant variable interests or has continuing involvement through servicing a majority of the assets in a vie is presented below 



 

the previous tables do not include the following 

 

 

the asset balances for consolidated vies represent the carrying amounts of the assets consolidated by the company the carrying amount may represent the amortized cost or the current fair value of the assets depending on the legal form of the asset eg loan or security and the company’s standard accounting policies for the asset type and line of business 

the asset balances for unconsolidated vies in which the company has significant involvement represent the most current information available to the company in most cases the asset balances represent an amortized cost basis without regard to impairments unless fair value information is readily available to the company 

the maximum funded exposure represents the balance sheet carrying amount of the company’s investment in the vie it reflects the initial amount of cash invested in the vie adjusted for any accrued interest and cash principal payments received the carrying amount may also be adjusted for increases or declines in fair value or any impairment in value recognized in earnings the maximum exposure of unfunded positions represents the remaining undrawn committed amount including liquidity and credit facilities provided by the company or the notional amount of a derivative instrument considered to be a variable interest in certain transactions the company has entered into derivative instruments or other arrangements that are not considered variable interests in the vie eg interest rate swaps crosscurrency swaps or where the company is the purchaser of credit protection under a credit default swap or total return swap where the company pays the total return on certain assets to the spe receivables under such arrangements are not included in the maximum exposure amounts 

funding commitments for significant unconsolidated vies—liquidity facilities and loan commitments 

the following table presents the notional amount of liquidity facilities and loan commitments that are classified as funding commitments in the vie tables above 



consolidated vies 

the company engages in onbalance sheet securitizations which are securitizations that do not qualify for sales treatment thus the assets remain on citi’s consolidated balance sheet and any proceeds received are recognized as secured liabilities the consolidated vies represent more than a hundred separate entities with which the company is involved in general the thirdparty investors in the obligations of consolidated vies have legal recourse only to the assets of the respective vies and do not have such recourse to the company except where citi has provided a guarantee to the investors or is the counterparty to certain 

 

derivative transactions involving the vie thus citigroup’s maximum legal exposure to loss related to consolidated vies is significantly less than the carrying value of the consolidated vie assets due to outstanding thirdparty financing intercompany assets and liabilities are excluded from citi’s consolidated balance sheet all vie assets are restricted from being sold or pledged as collateral the cash flows from these assets are the only source used to pay down the associated liabilities which are nonrecourse to citi’s general assets see the consolidated balance sheet for more information about these consolidated vie assets and liabilities 

significant interests in unconsolidated vies—balance sheet classification 

the following table presents the carrying amounts and classification of significant variable interests in unconsolidated vies 



credit card securitizations 

the company securitizes credit card receivables through trusts established to purchase the receivables citigroup transfers receivables into the trusts on a nonrecourse basis credit card securitizations are revolving securitizations as customers pay their credit card balances the cash proceeds are used to purchase new receivables and replenish the receivables in the trust 

substantially all of the company’s credit card securitization activity is through two  trusts—citibank credit card master trust master trust and citibank omni master trust omni trust with the substantial majority through the master trust these trusts are consolidated entities because as 

 

servicer citigroup has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the trusts citigroup holds a seller’s interest and certain securities issued by the trusts which could result in exposure to potentially significant losses or benefits from the trusts accordingly the transferred credit card receivables remain on citi’s consolidated balance sheet with no  gain or loss recognized the debt issued by the trusts to third parties is included on citi’s consolidated balance sheet 

citi utilizes securitizations as one of the sources of funding for its business in north america  the following table reflects amounts related to the company’s securitized credit card receivables 



the following table summarizes selected cash flow information related to citigroup’s credit card securitizations 



managed loans 

after securitization of credit card receivables the company continues to maintain credit card customer account relationships and provides servicing for receivables transferred to the trusts as a result the company considers the securitized credit card receivables to be part of the business it manages as citigroup consolidates the credit card trusts all managed securitized card receivables are onbalance sheet 

funding liquidity facilities and subordinated interests 

as noted above citigroup securitizes credit card receivables through two  securitization trusts—master trust and omni trust the liabilities of the trusts are included on the consolidated balance sheet excluding those retained by citigroup 

  

 

master trust liabilities at par value 

the master trust issues fixed and floatingrate term notes some of the term notes may be issued to multiseller commercial paper conduits the weighted average maturity of 

the term notes issued by the master trust was 30 years  as of december 31 2018  and 26 years  as of december 31 2017  



omni trust liabilities at par value 

the omni trust issues fixed and floatingrate term notes some of which are purchased by multiseller commercial paper conduits the weighted average maturity of the thirdparty term notes issued by the omni trust was 14 years  as of december 31 2018  and 19  years as of december 31 2017  



mortgage securitizations 

citigroup provides a wide range of mortgage loan products to a diverse customer base once originated the company often securitizes these loans through the use of vies these vies are funded through the issuance of trust certificates backed solely by the transferred assets these certificates have the same life as the transferred assets in addition to providing a source of liquidity and less expensive funding securitizing these assets also reduces citi’s credit exposure to the borrowers these mortgage loan securitizations are primarily nonrecourse thereby effectively transferring the risk of future credit losses to the purchasers of the securities issued by the trust 

citi’s us consumer mortgage business generally retains the servicing rights and in certain instances retains investment securities interestonly strips and residual interests in future cash flows from the trusts and also provides servicing for a limited number of icg  securitizations citi’s icg  business may hold investment securities pursuant to credit risk retention rules or in connection with secondary marketmaking activities 

the company securitizes mortgage loans generally through either a governmentsponsored agency such as ginnie mae fannie mae or freddie mac us agencysponsored mortgages or private label nonagencysponsored 

 

mortgages securitization citi is not the primary beneficiary 

of its us agencysponsored mortgage securitization entities because citigroup does not have the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance therefore citi does not consolidate these us agencysponsored mortgage securitization entities substantially all of the consumer loans sold or securitized through nonconsolidated trusts by citigroup are us prime residential mortgage loans retained interests in nonconsolidated agencysponsored mortgage securitization trusts are classified as trading account assets  except for msrs which are included in mortgage servicing rights  on citigroup’s consolidated balance sheet 

citigroup does not consolidate certain nonagencysponsored mortgage securitization entities because citi is either not the servicer with the power to direct the significant activities of the entity or citi is the servicer but the servicing relationship is deemed to be a fiduciary relationship therefore citi is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the entity 

in certain instances the company has i the power to direct the activities and ii the obligation to either absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could be potentially significant to its nonagencysponsored mortgage securitization entities and therefore is the primary beneficiary and thus consolidates the vie 

the following tables summarize selected cash flow information and retained interests related to citigroup mortgage securitizations 



note excludes resecuritization transactions 

1 the proceeds from new securitizations in 2016  include 03 billion  related to personal loan securitizations 

for nonconsolidated mortgage securitization entities where the transfer of loans to the vie meets the conditions for sale accounting citi recognizes a gain or loss based on the difference between the carrying value of the transferred assets and the proceeds received generally cash but may be beneficial interests or servicing rights 

 

agency and nonagency securitization gains for the year ended december 31 2018  were 17 million  and 36 million  respectively 

agency and nonagency securitization gains for the year ended december 31 2017  were 28 million  and 70 million  respectively and 76 million  and 5 million  respectively for the year ended december 31 2016  





key assumptions used in measuring the fair value of retained interests at the date of sale or securitization of mortgage receivables were as follows 





 

the interests retained by citi range from highly rated andor senior in the capital structure to unrated andor residual interests 

the key assumptions used to value retained interests and the sensitivity of the fair value to adverse changes of 10  and 20  in each of the key assumptions are presented in the 

 

tables below the negative effect of each change is calculated independently holding all other assumptions constant because the key assumptions may not be independent the net effect of simultaneous adverse changes in the key assumptions may be less than the sum of the individual effects shown below 











 

the following table includes information about loan delinquencies and liquidation losses for assets held in nonconsolidated nonagencysponsored securitization entities as of december 31 2018  and 2017  



mortgage servicing rights msrs 

in connection with the securitization of mortgage loans citi’s us consumer mortgage business generally retains the servicing rights which entitle the company to a future stream of cash flows based on the outstanding principal balances of the loans and the contractual servicing fee failure to service the loans in accordance with contractual requirements may lead to a termination of the servicing rights and the loss of future servicing fees 

these transactions create intangible assets referred to as msrs which are recorded at fair value on citi’s consolidated balance sheet the fair value of citi’s capitalized msrs was 584 million  and 558 million  at december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively the msrs correspond to principal loan balances of 62 billion  and 66 billion  as of december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively 

 

the following table summarizes the changes in capitalized msrs 



 

the fair value of the msrs is primarily affected by changes in prepayments of mortgages that result from shifts in mortgage interest rates specifically higher interest rates tend to lead to declining prepayments which causes the fair value of the msrs to increase in managing this risk citigroup economically hedges a significant portion of the value of its msrs through the use of interest rate derivative contracts forward purchase and sale commitments of mortgagebacked securities and purchased securities all classified as trading account assets  the company receives fees during the course of servicing previously securitized mortgages the amounts of these fees were as follows 



in the consolidated statement of income these fees are primarily classified as commissions and fees    and changes in msr fair values are classified as other revenue  

resecuritizations 

the company engages in resecuritization transactions in which debt securities are transferred to a vie in exchange for new beneficial interests citi did not transfer nonagency private label securities to resecuritization entities during the years ended december 31 2018  and 2017  these securities are backed by either residential or commercial mortgages and are often structured on behalf of clients 

as of december 31 2018  the fair value of citiretained interests in private label resecuritization transactions structured by citi totaled approximately 16 million  all related to resecuritization transactions executed prior to 2016 which has been recorded in trading account assets  of this amount all was related to subordinated beneficial interests as of december 31 2017  the fair value of citiretained interests in private label resecuritization transactions structured by citi totaled approximately 79 million  all related to resecuritization transactions executed prior to 2016 of this amount substantially all was related to subordinated beneficial interests the original par value of private label resecuritization transactions in which citi holds a retained interest as of december 31 2018  and 2017  was approximately 271 million  and 887 million  respectively 

the company also resecuritizes us governmentagency guaranteed mortgagebacked agency securities during the years ended december 31 2018  and 2017  citi transferred agency securities with a fair value of approximately 263 billion  and 266 billion  respectively to resecuritization entities 

as of december 31 2018  the fair value of citiretained interests in agency resecuritization transactions structured by citi totaled approximately 25 billion  including 14 billion  related to resecuritization transactions executed in 2018  compared to 21 billion  as of december 31 2017  including 854 million  related to resecuritization transactions executed in 2017  which is recorded in trading account assets  the original fair value of agency resecuritization transactions in 

 

which citi holds a retained interest as of december 31 2018  and 2017  was approximately 709 billion  and 683 billion  respectively 

as of december 31 2018  and 2017  the company did not consolidate any private label or agency resecuritization entities 

citiadministered assetbacked commercial paper conduits 

the company is active in the assetbacked commercial paper conduit business as administrator of several multiseller commercial paper conduits and also as a service provider to singleseller and other commercial paper conduits sponsored by third parties 

citi’s multiseller commercial paper conduits are designed to provide the company’s clients access to lowcost funding in the commercial paper markets the conduits purchase assets from or provide financing facilities to clients and are funded by issuing commercial paper to thirdparty investors the conduits generally do not purchase assets originated by citi the funding of the conduits is facilitated by the liquidity support and credit enhancements provided by the company 

as administrator to citi’s conduits the company is generally responsible for selecting and structuring assets purchased or financed by the conduits making decisions regarding the funding of the conduits including determining the tenor and other features of the commercial paper issued monitoring the quality and performance of the conduits’ assets and facilitating the operations and cash flows of the conduits in return the company earns structuring fees from customers for individual transactions and earns an administration fee from the conduit which is equal to the income from the client program and liquidity fees of the conduit after payment of conduit expenses this administration fee is fairly stable since most risks and rewards of the underlying assets are passed back to the clients once the asset pricing is negotiated most ongoing income costs and fees are relatively stable as a percentage of the conduit’s size 

the conduits administered by citi do not generally invest in liquid securities that are formally rated by third parties the assets are privately negotiated and structured transactions that are generally designed to be held by the conduit rather than actively traded and sold the yield earned by the conduit on each asset is generally tied to the rate on the commercial paper issued by the conduit thus passing interest rate risk to the client each asset purchased by the conduit is structured with transactionspecific credit enhancement features provided by the thirdparty client seller including overcollateralization cash and excess spread collateral accounts direct recourse or thirdparty guarantees these credit enhancements are sized with the objective of approximating a credit rating of a or above based on citi’s internal risk ratings at december 31 2018  and 2017  the conduits had approximately 188 billion  and 193 billion  of purchased assets outstanding respectively and had incremental funding commitments with clients of approximately 140 billion  and 145 billion  respectively 

substantially all of the funding of the conduits is in the form of shortterm commercial paper at december 31 2018  and 2017  the weighted average remaining lives of the 

commercial paper issued by the conduits were approximately 53  and 51 days  respectively 

the primary credit enhancement provided to the conduit investors is in the form of transactionspecific credit enhancements described above in addition to the transactionspecific credit enhancements the conduits other than the government guaranteed loan conduit have obtained a letter of credit from the company which is equal to at least 8  to 10  of the conduit’s assets with a minimum of 200 million  the letters of credit provided by the company to the conduits total approximately 17 billion  as of december 31 2018  and 2017  the net result across multiseller conduits administered by the company is that in the event defaulted assets exceed the transactionspecific credit enhancements described above any losses in each conduit are allocated first to the company and then to the commercial paper investors 

citigroup also provides the conduits with two  forms of liquidity agreements that are used to provide funding to the conduits in the event of a market disruption among other events each asset of the conduits is supported by a transactionspecific liquidity facility in the form of an asset purchase agreement apa under the apa the company has generally agreed to purchase nondefaulted eligible receivables from the conduit at par the apa is not designed to provide credit support to the conduit as it generally does not permit the purchase of defaulted or impaired assets any funding under the apa will likely subject the underlying conduit clients to increased interest costs in addition the company provides the conduits with programwide liquidity in the form of shortterm lending commitments under these commitments the company has agreed to lend to the conduits in the event of a shortterm disruption in the commercial paper market subject to specified conditions the company receives fees for providing both types of liquidity agreements and considers these fees to be on fair market terms 

finally citi is one of several named dealers in the commercial paper issued by the conduits and earns a marketbased fee for providing such services along with thirdparty dealers the company makes a market in the commercial paper and may from time to time fund commercial paper pending sale to a third party on specific dates with less liquidity in the market the company may hold in inventory commercial paper issued by conduits administered by the company as well as conduits administered by third parties separately in the normal course of business citi purchases commercial paper including commercial paper issued by citigroups conduits at december 31 2018  and 2017  the company owned 55 billion  and 93 billion  respectively of the commercial paper issued by its administered conduits the companys investments were not driven by market illiquidity and the company is not obligated under any agreement to purchase the commercial paper issued by the conduits 

the assetbacked commercial paper conduits are consolidated by citi the company has determined that through its roles as administrator and liquidity provider it has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities’ economic performance these powers include its ability to structure and approve the assets purchased by the conduits its ongoing surveillance and credit mitigation activities its ability to sell or repurchase assets out of the 

 

conduits and its liability management in addition as a result of all the company’s involvement described above it was concluded that citi has an economic interest that could potentially be significant however the assets and liabilities of the conduits are separate and apart from those of citigroup no assets of any conduit are available to satisfy the creditors of citigroup or any of its other subsidiaries 

collateralized loan obligations clos 

a collateralized loan obligation clo is a vie that purchases a portfolio of assets consisting primarily of noninvestment grade corporate loans clos issue multiple tranches of debt and equity to investors to fund the asset purchases and pay upfront expenses associated with forming the clo a thirdparty asset manager is contracted by the clo to purchase the underlying assets from the open market and monitor the credit risk associated with those assets over the term of a clo the asset manager directs purchases and sales of assets in a manner consistent with the clo’s asset management agreement and indenture in general the clo asset manager will have the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the economic performance of the clo investors in a clo through their ownership of debt andor equity in it can also direct certain activities of the clo including removing its asset manager under limited circumstances optionally redeeming the notes voting on amendments to the clo’s operating documents and other activities a clo has a finite life typically 12 years  

citi serves as a structuring and placement agent with respect to the clos typically the debt and equity of the clos are sold to thirdparty investors on occasion certain citi entities may purchase some portion of a clo’s liabilities for investment purposes in addition citi may purchase typically in the secondary market certain securities issued by the clos to support its market making activities 

the company does not generally have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the clos as this power is generally held by a thirdparty asset manager of the clo as such those clos are not consolidated 

the following tables summarize selected cash flow information and retained interests related to citigroup clos 





key assumptions used in measuring the fair value of retained interests at the date of sale or securitization of clos were as follows 



the key assumptions used to value retained interests in clos and the sensitivity of the fair value to adverse changes of 10 and 20 are set forth in the tables below 





all of citi’s retained interests were heldtomaturity securities as of december 31 2018  and substantially all were heldtomaturity securities as of december 31 2017  

assetbased financing 

the company provides loans and other forms of financing to vies that hold assets those loans are subject to the same credit approvals as all other loans originated or purchased by the company financings in the form of debt securities or derivatives are in most circumstances reported in trading account assets  and accounted for at fair value through earnings the company generally does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact these vies’ economic performance thus it does not consolidate them 

the primary types of citi’s assetbased financings total assets of the unconsolidated vies with significant involvement and citi’s maximum exposure to loss are shown below for citi to realize the maximum loss the vie borrower would have to default with no recovery from the assets held by the vie 





 

municipal securities tender option bond tob trusts 

municipal tob trusts may hold fixed or floatingrate taxable or taxexempt securities issued by state and local governments and municipalities tob trusts are typically structured as singleissuer entities whose assets are purchased from either the company or from other investors in the municipal securities market tob trusts finance the purchase of their municipal assets by issuing two  classes of certificates longdated floating rate certificates “floaters” that are putable pursuant to a liquidity facility and residual interest certificates “residuals” the floaters are purchased by thirdparty investors typically taxexempt money market funds the residuals are purchased by the original owner of the municipal securities that are being financed 

from citigroup’s perspective there are two  types of tob trusts customer and noncustomer customer tob trusts are those trusts utilized by customers of the company to finance their securities generally municipal securities the residuals issued by these trusts are purchased by the customer being financed noncustomer tob trusts are generally used by the company to finance its own municipal securities investments the residuals issued by noncustomer tob trusts are purchased by the company 

with respect to both customer and noncustomer tob trusts citi may provide remarketing agent services if floaters are optionally tendered and the company in its role as remarketing agent is unable to find a new investor to purchase the optionally tendered floaters within a specified period of time citigroup may but is not obligated to purchase the tendered floaters into its own inventory the level of the company’s inventory of such floaters fluctuates 

for certain customer tob trusts citi may also serve as a voluntary advance provider in this capacity the company may but is not obligated to make loan advances to customer tob trusts to purchase optionally tendered floaters that have not otherwise been successfully remarketed to new investors such loans are secured by pledged floaters as of december 31 2018  citi had no outstanding voluntary advances to customer tob trusts 

for certain noncustomer trusts the company also provides credit enhancement at december 31 2018  and 2017  none  of the municipal bonds owned by noncustomer tob trusts were subject to a credit guarantee provided by the company 

citigroup also provides liquidity services to many customer and noncustomer trusts if a trust is unwound early due to an event other than a credit event on the underlying municipal bonds the underlying municipal bonds are sold out of the trust and bond sale proceeds are used to redeem the outstanding trust certificates if this results in a shortfall between the bond sale proceeds and the redemption price of the tendered floaters the company pursuant to the liquidity agreement would be obligated to make a payment to the trust to satisfy that shortfall for certain customer tob trusts citigroup has also executed a reimbursement agreement with the holder of the residual pursuant to which the residual holder is obligated to reimburse the company for any payment the company makes under the liquidity arrangement these reimbursement agreements may be subject to daily margining based on changes in the market value of the underlying 

municipal bonds in cases where a third party provides liquidity to a noncustomer tob trust a similar reimbursement arrangement may be executed whereby the company or a consolidated subsidiary of the company as residual holder would absorb any losses incurred by the liquidity provider 

for certain other noncustomer tob trusts citi serves as tender option provider the tender option provider arrangement allows floater holders to put their interests directly to the company at any time subject to the requisite notice period requirements at a price of par 

at december 31 2018  and 2017  liquidity agreements provided with respect to customer tob trusts totaled 43 billion  and 32 billion  respectively of which 23 billion  and 20 billion  respectively were offset by reimbursement agreements for the remaining exposure related to tob transactions where the residual owned by the customer was at least 25  of the bond value at the inception of the transaction no reimbursement agreement was executed 

citi considers both customer and noncustomer tob trusts to be vies customer tob trusts are not consolidated by the company as the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the trust’s economic performance rests with the customer residual holder which may unilaterally cause the sale of the trust’s bonds 

noncustomer tob trusts generally are consolidated because the company holds the residual interest and thus has the unilateral power to cause the sale of the trust’s bonds 

the company also provides other liquidity agreements or letters of credit to customersponsored municipal investment funds which are not variable interest entities and municipalityrelated issuers that totaled 61 billion  as of december 31 2018  and 2017  these liquidity agreements and letters of credit are offset by reimbursement agreements with various termout provisions 

municipal investments 

municipal investment transactions include debt and equity interests in partnerships that finance the construction and rehabilitation of lowincome housing facilitate lending in new or underserved markets or finance the construction or operation of renewable municipal energy facilities citi generally invests in these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits and grants earned from the investments made by the partnership the company may also provide construction loans or permanent loans for the development or operation of real estate properties held by partnerships these entities are generally considered vies the power to direct the activities of these entities is typically held by the general partner accordingly these entities are not consolidated by citigroup 

 

client intermediation 

client intermediation transactions represent a range of transactions designed to provide investors with specified returns based on the returns of an underlying security referenced asset or index these transactions include creditlinked notes and equitylinked notes in these transactions the vie typically obtains exposure to the underlying security referenced asset or index through a derivative instrument such as a totalreturn swap or a creditdefault swap in turn the vie issues notes to investors that pay a return based on the specified underlying security referenced asset or index the vie invests the proceeds in a financial asset or a guaranteed insurance contract that serves as collateral for the derivative contract over the term of the transaction the company’s involvement in these transactions includes being the counterparty to the vie’s derivative instruments and investing in a portion of the notes issued by the vie in certain transactions the investor’s maximum risk of loss is limited and the company absorbs risk of loss above a specified level citi does not have the power to direct the activities of the vies that most significantly impact their economic performance and thus it does not consolidate them 

citi’s maximum risk of loss in these transactions is defined as the amount invested in notes issued by the vie and the notional amount of any risk of loss absorbed by citi through a separate instrument issued by the vie the derivative instrument held by the company may generate a receivable from the vie for example where the company purchases credit protection from the vie in connection with the vie’s issuance of a creditlinked note which is collateralized by the assets owned by the vie these derivative instruments are not considered variable interests and any associated receivables are not included in the calculation of maximum exposure to the vie 

investment funds 

the company is the investment manager for certain investment funds and retirement funds that invest in various asset classes including private equity hedge funds real estate fixed income and infrastructure citigroup earns a management fee which is a percentage of capital under management and may earn performance fees in addition for some of these funds the company has an ownership interest in the investment funds citi has also established a number of investment funds as opportunities for qualified employees to invest in private equity investments the company acts as investment manager for these funds and may provide employees with financing on both recourse and nonrecourse bases for a portion of the employees’ investment commitments 

22 derivatives activities 

in the ordinary course of business citigroup enters into various types of derivative transactions which include   

 

swaps forwards and some option contracts are overthecounter otc derivatives that are bilaterally negotiated with counterparties and settled with those counterparties except for swap contracts that are novated and cleared through central counterparties ccps futures contracts and other option contracts are standardized contracts that are traded on an exchange with a ccp as the counterparty from the inception of the transaction citigroup enters into derivative contracts relating to interest rate foreign currency commodity and other marketcredit risks for the following reasons 



 

denominated debt foreign currencydenominated afs securities and net investment exposures 

derivatives may expose citigroup to market credit or liquidity risks in excess of the amounts recorded on the consolidated balance sheet market risk on a derivative product is the exposure created by potential fluctuations in interest rates market prices foreign exchange rates and other factors and is a function of the type of product the volume of transactions the tenor and terms of the agreement and the underlying volatility credit risk is the exposure to loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to satisfy a derivative liability where the value of any collateral held by citi is not adequate to cover such losses the recognition in earnings of unrealized gains on derivative transactions is subject to management’s assessment of the probability of counterparty default liquidity risk is the potential exposure that arises when the size of a derivative position may affect the ability to monetize the position in a reasonable period of time and at a reasonable cost in periods of high volatility and financial stress 

derivative transactions are customarily documented under industry standard master netting agreements which provide that following an event of default the nondefaulting party may promptly terminate all transactions between the parties and determine the net amount due to be paid to or by the defaulting party events of default include i failure to make a payment on a derivative transaction that remains uncured following applicable notice and grace periods ii breach of agreement that remains uncured after applicable notice and grace periods iii breach of a representation iv cross default either to thirdparty debt or to other derivative transactions entered into between the parties or in some cases their affiliates v the occurrence of a merger or consolidation that results in a party’s becoming a materially weaker credit and vi the cessation or repudiation of any applicable guarantee or other credit support document obligations under master netting agreements are often secured by collateral posted under an industry standard credit support annex to the master netting agreement an event of default may also occur under a credit support annex if a party fails to make a collateral delivery that remains uncured following applicable notice and grace periods 

the netting and collateral rights incorporated in the master netting agreements are considered to be legally enforceable if a supportive legal opinion has been obtained from counsel of recognized standing that provides i the requisite level of certainty regarding enforceability and ii that the exercise of rights by the nondefaulting party to terminate and closeout transactions on a net basis under these agreements will not be stayed or avoided under applicable law upon an event of default including bankruptcy insolvency or similar proceeding 

a legal opinion may not be sought for certain jurisdictions where local law is silent or unclear as to the enforceability of such rights or where adverse case law or conflicting regulation may cast doubt on the enforceability of such rights in some jurisdictions and for some counterparty types the insolvency law may not provide the requisite level of certainty for 

example this may be the case for certain sovereigns municipalities central banks and us pension plans 

exposure to credit risk on derivatives is affected by market volatility which may impair the ability of counterparties to satisfy their obligations to the company credit limits are established and closely monitored for customers engaged in derivatives transactions citi considers the level of legal certainty regarding enforceability of its offsetting rights under master netting agreements and credit support annexes to be an important factor in its risk management process specifically citi generally transacts much lower volumes of derivatives under master netting agreements where citi does not have the requisite level of legal certainty regarding enforceability because such derivatives consume greater amounts of single counterparty credit limits than those executed under enforceable master netting agreements 

cash collateral and security collateral in the form of g10 government debt securities are often posted by a party to a master netting agreement to secure the net open exposure of the other party the receiving party is free to comminglerehypothecate such collateral in the ordinary course of its business nonstandard collateral such as corporate bonds municipal bonds us agency securities andor mbs may also be pledged as collateral for derivative transactions security collateral posted to open and maintain a master netting agreement with a counterparty in the form of cash andor securities may from time to time be segregated in an account at a thirdparty custodian pursuant to a triparty account control agreement 

as of january 1 2018 citigroup early adopted asu 201712 targeted improvements to accounting for hedge activities  this standard primarily impacts citi’s accounting for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and fair value hedges refer to the respective sections below for details 

information pertaining to citigroup’s derivative activities based on notional amounts is presented in the table below derivative notional amounts are reference amounts from which contractual payments are derived and do not represent a complete and accurate measure of citi’s exposure to derivative transactions rather citi’s derivative exposure arises primarily from market fluctuations ie market risk counterparty failure ie credit risk andor periods of high volatility or financial stress ie liquidity risk as well as any market valuation adjustments that may be required on the 

 

transactions moreover notional amounts do not reflect the netting of offsetting trades for example if citi enters into a receivefixed interest rate swap with 100 million notional and offsets this risk with an identical but opposite payfixed position with a different counterparty 200 million in derivative notionals is reported although these offsetting positions may result in de minimis overall market risk aggregate derivative notional amounts can fluctuate from period to period in the normal course of business based on citi’s market share levels of client activity and other factors all derivatives are recorded in trading account assetstrading account liabilities  on the consolidated balance sheet 

derivative notionals 





the following tables present the gross and net fair values of the company’s derivative transactions and the related offsetting amounts as of december 31 2018  and 2017 gross positive fair values are offset against gross negative fair values by counterparty pursuant to enforceable master netting agreements under asc 8151045 payables and receivables in respect of cash collateral received from or paid to a given counterparty pursuant to a credit support annex are included in the offsetting amount if a legal opinion supporting the enforceability of netting and collateral rights has been obtained gaap does not permit similar offsetting for security collateral 

in addition the following tables reflect rule changes adopted by clearing organizations that require or allow entities to treat derivative assets liabilities and the related variation margin as settlement of the related derivative fair value for legal and accounting purposes as opposed to presenting gross derivative assets and liabilities that are subject to collateral whereby the counterparties would record a related collateral payable or receivable as a result the tables reflect a reduction of approximately 100 billion  as of both december 31 2018 and 2017 respectively of derivative assets and derivative liabilities that previously would have been reported on a gross basis but are now settled and not subject to collateral the tables also present amounts that are not permitted to be offset such as security collateral or cash collateral posted at thirdparty custodians but which would be eligible for offsetting to the extent that an event of default occurred and a legal opinion supporting enforceability of the netting and collateral rights has been obtained

for the years ended   december 31 2018  2017  and 2016 the amounts recognized in principal transactions  in the consolidated statement of income related to derivatives not designated in a qualifying hedging relationship as well as the underlying nonderivative instruments are presented in note 6  to the consolidated financial statements citigroup presents this disclosure by showing derivative gains and losses related to its trading activities together with gains and losses related to nonderivative instruments within the same trading portfolios as this represents how these portfolios are risk managed 

the amounts recognized in other revenue  in the consolidated statement of income related to derivatives not designated in a qualifying hedging relationship are shown below the table below does not include any offsetting gains losses on the economically hedged items to the extent that such amounts are also recorded in other revenue  



accounting for derivative hedging 

citigroup accounts for its hedging activities in accordance with asc 815 derivatives and hedging  as a general rule hedge accounting is permitted where the company is exposed to a particular risk such as interest rate or foreign exchange risk that causes changes in the fair value of an asset or liability or variability in the expected future cash flows of an existing asset liability or a forecasted transaction that may affect earnings 

derivative contracts hedging the risks associated with changes in fair value are referred to as fair value hedges while contracts hedging the variability of expected future cash flows are cash flow hedges hedges that utilize derivatives or debt instruments to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with equity investments in nonusdollarfunctionalcurrency foreign subsidiaries net investment in a foreign operation are net investment hedges 

to qualify as an accounting hedge under the hedge accounting rules versus an economic hedge where hedge accounting is not applied a hedging relationship must be highly effective in offsetting the risk designated as being 

hedged the hedging relationship must be formally documented at inception detailing the particular risk management objective and strategy for the hedge this includes the item and risks being hedged the hedging instrument being used and how effectiveness will be assessed the effectiveness of these hedging relationships is evaluated at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis both on a 

 

retrospective and prospective basis typically using quantitative measures of correlation with hedge ineffectiveness measured and recorded in current earnings hedge effectiveness assessment methodologies are performed in a similar manner for similar hedges and are used consistently throughout the hedging relationships the assessment of effectiveness may exclude changes in the value of the hedged item that are unrelated to the risks being hedged and the changes in fair value of the derivative associated with time value prior to january 1 2018 these excluded items were recognized in current earnings for the hedging derivative while changes in the value of a hedged item that were not related to the hedged risk were not recorded upon adoption of asc 201712 citi excludes changes in the cross currency basis associated with cross currency swaps from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and records it in other comprehensive income 

discontinued hedge accounting 

a hedging instrument must be highly effective in accomplishing the hedge objective of offsetting either changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item for the risk being hedged management may voluntarily dedesignate an accounting hedge at any time but if a hedging relationship is not highly effective it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting and must be dedesignated subsequent changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognized in other revenue  or principal transactions  similar to trading derivatives with no offset recorded related to the hedged item 

for fair value hedges any changes in the fair value of the hedged item remain as part of the basis of the asset or liability and are ultimately realized as an element of the yield on the item for cash flow hedges changes in fair value of the enduser derivative remain in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  aoci and are included in the earnings of future periods when the forecasted hedged cash flows impact earnings however if it becomes probable that some or all of the hedged forecasted transactions will not occur any amounts that remain in aoci   related to these transactions must be immediately reflected in other revenue  

the foregoing criteria are applied on a decentralized basis consistent with the level at which market risk is managed but are subject to various limits and controls the underlying asset liability or forecasted transaction may be an individual item or a portfolio of similar items 

fair value hedges 

hedging of benchmark interest rate risk 

citigroup’s fair value hedges are primarily hedges of fixedrate longterm debt or assets such as availableforsale debt securities or loans 

for qualifying fair value hedges of interest rate risk the changes in the fair value of the derivative and the change in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk either total cash flows or benchmark only cash flows are presented within interest revenue or interest expense  based on whether the hedged item is an asset or a liability prior to the adoption of asu 201712 the fair value of the derivative was presented in other revenue  or principal transactions  and the difference between the changes in the hedged item and the derivative was defined as ineffectiveness 

hedging of foreign exchange risk 

citigroup hedges the change in fair value attributable to foreign exchange rate movements in availableforsale debt securities and longterm debt that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity holding the securities or issuing the debt which may be within or outside the us the hedging instrument may be a forward foreign exchange contract or a crosscurrency swap contract citigroup considers the premium associated with forward contracts ie the differential between the spot and contractual forward rates as the cost of hedging this amount is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and reflected directly in earnings over the life of the hedge beginning january 1 2018 citi excludes changes in crosscurrency basis associated with crosscurrency swaps from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and records it in other comprehensive income 

 

hedging of commodity price risk 

citigroup hedges the change in fair value attributable to spot price movements in physical commodities inventory the hedging instrument is a futures contract to sell the underlying commodity in this hedge the change in the value of the hedged inventory is reflected in earnings which offsets the change in the fair value of the futures contract that is also reflected in earnings although the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument recorded in earnings includes changes in forward rates citigroup excludes the differential between the spot and the contractual forward rates under the futures contract from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and amortizes it directly into earnings over the life of the hedge 

the following table summarizes the gains losses on the company’s fair value hedges 



 

cumulative basis adjustment 

upon electing to apply asc 815 fair value hedge accounting the carrying value of the hedged item is adjusted to reflect the cumulative impact of changes in the hedged risk the hedge basis adjustment whether arising from an active or dedesignated hedge relationship remains with the hedged item until the hedged item is derecognized from the balance sheet the table below presents the carrying amount of citi’s hedged assets and liabilities under qualifying fair value hedges at december 31 2018 along with the cumulative hedge basis adjustments included in the carrying value of those hedged assets and liabilities 

 



cash flow hedges 

citigroup hedges the variability of forecasted cash flows associated with floatingrate assetsliabilities and other forecasted transactions variable cash flows from those liabilities are synthetically converted to fixedrate cash flows by entering into receivevariable payfixed interest rate swaps and receivevariable payfixed forwardstarting interest rate swaps variable cash flows associated with certain assets are synthetically converted to fixedrate cash flows by entering into receivefixed payvariable interest rate swaps these cash flow hedging relationships use either regression analysis or dollaroffset ratio analysis to assess whether the hedging relationships are highly effective at inception and on an ongoing basis prior to the adoption of asu 201712 citigroup designated the risk being hedged as the risk of overall variability in the hedged cash flows for certain items 

 

with the adoption of asu 201712 citigroup hedges the variability from changes in a contractually specified rate and recognizes the entire change in fair value of the cash flow hedging instruments in aoci prior to the adoption of asu 201712 to the extent that these derivatives were not fully effective changes in their fair values in excess of changes in the value of the hedged transactions were immediately included in other revenue  with the adoption of asu 201712 such amounts are no longer required to be immediately recognized in income but instead the full change in the value of the hedging instrument is required to be recognized in aoci and then recognized in earnings in the same period that the cash flows impact earnings the pretax change in aoci from cash flow hedges is presented below 



 

for cash flow hedges the changes in the fair value of the hedging derivative remain in aoci on the consolidated balance sheet and will be included in the earnings of future periods to offset the variability of the hedged cash flows when such cash flows affect earnings the net gain loss associated with cash flow hedges expected to be reclassified from aoci within 12 months of december 31 2018  is approximately 404 million  the maximum length of time over which forecasted cash flows are hedged is 10  years 

the aftertax impact of cash flow hedges on aoci is shown in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements 

net investment hedges 

consistent with asc 83020 foreign currency matters—foreign currency transactions  asc 815 allows the hedging of the foreign currency risk of a net investment in a foreign operation citigroup uses foreign currency forwards crosscurrency swaps options and foreign currencydenominated debt instruments to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with citigroup’s equity investments in several nonusdollarfunctionalcurrency foreign subsidiaries citigroup records the change in the carrying amount of these investments in the foreign currency translation adjustment  account within aoci simultaneously the effective portion of the hedge of this exposure is also recorded in the foreign currency translation adjustment  account and any ineffective portion is immediately recorded in earnings 

for derivatives designated as net investment hedges citigroup follows the forwardrate method outlined in asc 8153535 according to that method all changes in fair value including changes related to the forwardrate component of the foreign currency forward contracts and the time value of foreign currency options are recorded in the foreign currency translation adjustment  account within aoci 

for foreign currencydenominated debt instruments that are designated as hedges of net investments the translation gain or loss that is recorded in the foreign currency translation adjustment  account is based on the spot exchange rate between the functional currency of the respective subsidiary and the us dollar which is the functional currency of citigroup to the extent that the notional amount of the hedging instrument exactly matches the hedged net investment and the underlying exchange rate of the derivative hedging instrument relates to the exchange rate between the functional currency of the net investment and citigroup’s functional currency or in the case of a nonderivative debt instrument such instrument is denominated in the functional currency of the net investment no  ineffectiveness is recorded in earnings 

the pretax gain loss recorded in the foreign currency translation adjustment  account within aoci related to net investment hedges is 1207 million  2528 million  and 220 million  for the years ended   december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively 

economic hedges 

citigroup often uses economic hedges when hedge accounting would be too complex or operationally burdensome enduser derivatives that are economic hedges are carried at fair value with changes in value included in either principal transactions  or other revenue  

for assetliability management hedging fixedrate longterm debt is recorded at amortized cost under gaap 

for other hedges that either do not meet the asc 815 hedging criteria or for which management decides not to apply asc 815 hedge accounting the derivative is recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with the associated changes in fair value recorded in earnings while the debt continues to be carried at amortized cost therefore current earnings are affected by the interest rate shifts and other factors that cause a 

 

change in the swap’s value but for which no offsetting change in value is recorded on the debt 

citigroup may alternatively elect to account for the debt at fair value under the fair value option once the irrevocable election is made upon issuance of the debt the full change in fair value of the debt is reported in earnings the changes in fair value of the related interest rate swap are also reflected in earnings which provides a natural offset to the debt’s fair value change to the extent that the two amounts differ because the full change in the fair value of the debt includes risks not offset by the interest rate swap the difference is automatically captured in current earnings 

additional economic hedges include hedges of the credit risk component of commercial loans and loan commitments citigroup periodically evaluates its hedging strategies in other areas and may designate either an accounting hedge or an economic hedge after considering the relative costs and benefits economic hedges are also employed when the hedged item itself is marked to market through current earnings such as hedges of commitments to originate one to fourfamily mortgage loans to be hfs and msrs 

credit derivatives 

citi is a market maker and trades a range of credit derivatives through these contracts citi either purchases or writes protection on either a single name or a portfolio of reference credits citi also uses credit derivatives to help mitigate credit risk in its corporate and consumer loan portfolios and other cash positions and to facilitate client transactions 

citi monitors its counterparty credit risk in credit derivative contracts as of both december 31 2018  and 2017 approximately 98  of the gross receivables are from counterparties with which citi maintains collateral agreements a majority of citi’s top 15  counterparties by receivable balance owed to citi are banks financial institutions or other dealers contracts with these counterparties do not include ratingsbased termination events however counterparty ratings downgrades may have an incremental effect by lowering the threshold at which citi may call for additional collateral 

the range of credit derivatives entered into includes credit default swaps total return swaps credit options and creditlinked notes 

a credit default swap is a contract in which for a fee a protection seller agrees to reimburse a protection buyer for any losses that occur due to a predefined credit event on a reference entity these credit events are defined by the terms of the derivative contract and the reference credit and are generally limited to the market standard of failure to pay on indebtedness and bankruptcy of the reference credit and in a more limited range of transactions debt restructuring credit derivative transactions that reference emerging market entities also typically include additional credit events to cover the acceleration of indebtedness and the risk of repudiation or a payment moratorium in certain transactions protection may be provided on a portfolio of reference entities or assetbacked securities if there is no credit event as defined by the specific derivative contract then the protection seller makes no payments to the protection buyer and receives only the 

contractually specified fee however if a credit event occurs as defined in the specific derivative contract sold the protection seller will be required to make a payment to the protection buyer under certain contracts the seller of protection may not be required to make a payment until a specified amount of losses has occurred with respect to the portfolio andor may only be required to pay for losses up to a specified amount 

a total return swap typically transfers the total economic performance of a reference asset which includes all associated cash flows as well as capital appreciation or depreciation the protection buyer receives a floating rate of interest and any depreciation on the reference asset from the protection seller and in return the protection seller receives the cash flows associated with the reference asset plus any appreciation thus according to the total return swap agreement the protection seller will be obligated to make a payment any time the floating interest rate payment plus any depreciation of the reference asset exceeds the cash flows associated with the underlying asset a total return swap may terminate upon a default of the reference asset or a credit event with respect to the reference entity subject to the provisions of the related total return swap agreement between the protection seller and the protection buyer 

a credit option is a credit derivative that allows investors to trade or hedge changes in the credit quality of a reference entity for example in a credit spread option the option writer assumes the obligation to purchase or sell credit protection on the reference entity at a specified “strike” spread level the option purchaser buys the right to sell credit default protection on the reference entity to or purchase it from the option writer at the strike spread level the payments on credit spread options depend either on a particular credit spread or the price of the underlying creditsensitive asset or other reference entity the options usually terminate if a credit event occurs with respect to the underlying reference entity 

a creditlinked note is a form of credit derivative structured as a debt security with an embedded credit default swap the purchaser of the note effectively provides credit protection to the issuer by agreeing to receive a return that could be negatively affected by credit events on the underlying reference credit if the reference entity defaults the note may be cash settled or physically settled by delivery of a debt security of the reference entity thus the maximum amount of the note purchaser’s exposure is the amount paid for the creditlinked note 

the following tables summarize the key characteristics of citi’s credit derivatives portfolio by counterparty and derivative form 



 





fair values included in the above tables are prior to application of any netting agreements and cash collateral for notional amounts citi generally has a mismatch between the total notional amounts of protection purchased and sold and it may hold the reference assets directly rather than entering into offsetting credit derivative contracts as and when desired the open risk exposures from credit derivative contracts are largely matched after certain cash positions in reference assets are considered and after notional amounts are adjusted either to a durationbased equivalent basis or to reflect the level of subordination in tranched structures the ratings of the credit derivatives portfolio presented in the tables and used to evaluate paymentperformance risk are based on the assigned internal or external ratings of the reference asset or entity where external ratings are used investmentgrade ratings are considered to be “baabbb” and above while anything below is considered noninvestment grade citi’s internal ratings are in line with the related external rating system 

citigroup evaluates the paymentperformance risk of the credit derivatives for which it stands as a protection seller based on the credit rating assigned to the underlying reference credit credit derivatives written on an underlying noninvestment grade reference credit represent greater payment risk to the company the noninvestment grade category in the table above also includes credit derivatives where the underlying reference entity has been downgraded subsequent to the inception of the derivative 

the maximum potential amount of future payments under credit derivative contracts presented in the table above is based on the notional value of the derivatives the company believes that the notional amount for credit protection sold is not representative of the actual loss exposure based on historical experience this amount has not been reduced by the value of the reference assets and the related cash flows in accordance with most credit derivative contracts should a credit event occur the company usually is liable for the difference between the protection sold and the value of the reference assets furthermore the notional amount for credit protection sold has not been reduced for any cash collateral paid to a given counterparty as such payments would be calculated after netting all derivative exposures including any credit derivatives with that counterparty in accordance with a related master netting agreement due to such netting processes determining the amount of collateral that corresponds to credit derivative exposures alone is not possible the company actively monitors open creditrisk exposures and manages this exposure by using a variety of strategies including purchased credit derivatives cash collateral or direct holdings of the referenced assets this risk mitigation activity is not captured in the table above 

 

credit riskrelated contingent features in derivatives 

certain derivative instruments contain provisions that require the company to either post additional collateral or immediately settle any outstanding liability balances upon the occurrence of a specified event related to the credit risk of the company these events which are defined by the existing derivative contracts are primarily downgrades in the credit ratings of the company and its affiliates 

the fair value excluding cva of all derivative instruments with creditriskrelated contingent features that were in a net liability position at both december 31 2018  and 2017 was 33 billion  and 29 billion  respectively the company posted 33 billion  and 28 billion  as collateral for this exposure in the normal course of business as of december 31 2018  and 2017 respectively 

a downgrade could trigger additional collateral or cash settlement requirements for the company and certain affiliates in the event that citigroup and citibank were downgraded a single notch by all three  major rating agencies as of december 31 2018  the company could be required to post an additional 06 billion  as either collateral or settlement of the derivative transactions additionally the company could be required to segregate with thirdparty custodians collateral previously received from existing derivative counterparties in the amount of 01 billion  upon the single notch downgrade resulting in aggregate cash obligations and collateral requirements of approximately 07 billion  

derivatives accompanied by financial asset transfers 

the company executes total return swaps that provide it with synthetic exposure to substantially all of the economic return of the securities or other financial assets referenced in the contract in certain cases the derivative transaction is accompanied by the company’s transfer of the referenced financial asset to the derivative counterparty most typically in response to the derivative counterparty’s desire to hedge in whole or in part its synthetic exposure under the derivative contract by holding the referenced asset in funded form in certain jurisdictions these transactions qualify as sales resulting in derecognition of the securities transferred see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the related sale conditions for transfers of financial assets for a significant portion of the transactions the company has also executed another total return swap where the company passes on substantially all of the economic return of the referenced securities to a different third party seeking the exposure in those cases the company is not exposed on a net basis to changes in the economic return of the referenced securities 

these transactions generally involve the transfer of the company’s liquid government bonds convertible bonds or publicly traded corporate equity securities from the trading portfolio and are executed with thirdparty financial institutions the accompanying derivatives are typically total return swaps the derivatives are cash settled and subject to ongoing margin requirements 

when the conditions for sale accounting are met the company reports the transfer of the referenced financial asset as a sale and separately reports the accompanying derivative 

transaction these transactions generally do not result in a gain or loss on the sale of the security because the transferred security was held at fair value in the company’s trading portfolio for transfers of financial assets accounted for as a sale by the company and for which the company has retained substantially all of the economic exposure to the transferred asset through a total return swap executed with the same counterparty in contemplation of the initial sale and still outstanding both the asset amounts derecognized and gross cash proceeds received as of the date of derecognition were 41 billion  and 30 billion  as of december 31 2018  and 2017 respectively 

at december 31 2018  the fair value of these previously derecognized assets was 41 billion  the fair value of the total return swaps as of december 31 2018 was 55 million  recorded as gross derivative assets and 9 million  recorded as gross derivative liabilities at december 31 2017 the fair value of these previously derecognized assets was 31 billion  and the fair value of the total return swaps was 89 million  recorded as gross derivative assets and 15 million  recorded as gross derivative liabilities 

the balances for the total return swaps are on a gross basis before the application of counterparty and cash collateral netting and are included primarily as equity derivatives in the tabular disclosures in this note 

23 concentrations of credit risk 

concentrations of credit risk exist when changes in economic industry or geographic factors similarly affect groups of counterparties whose aggregate credit exposure is material in relation to citigroup’s total credit exposure although citigroup’s portfolio of financial instruments is broadly diversified along industry product and geographic lines material transactions are completed with other financial institutions particularly in the securities trading derivatives and foreign exchange businesses 

in connection with the company’s efforts to maintain a diversified portfolio the company limits its exposure to any one geographic region country or individual creditor and monitors this exposure on a continuous basis at december 31 2018  citigroup’s most significant concentration of credit risk was with the us government and its agencies the company’s exposure which primarily results from trading assets and investments issued by the us government and its agencies amounted to 2500 billion  and 2278 billion  at december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively the german and japanese governments and their agencies which are rated investment grade by both moody’s and sp were the next largest exposures the company’s exposure to germany amounted to 464 billion  and 383 billion  at december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively and was composed of investment securities loans and trading assets the company’s exposure to japan amounted to 288 billion  and 258 billion  at december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively and was composed of investment securities loans and trading assets 

the company’s exposure to states and municipalities amounted to 279 billion  and 306 billion  at december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively and was composed of trading assets investment securities derivatives and lending activities 

24 fair value measurement 

asc 82010 fair value measurement  defines fair value establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value and requires disclosures about fair value measurements fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and therefore represents an exit price among other things the standard requires the company to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value 

under asc 82010 the probability of default of a counterparty is factored into the valuation of derivative and other positions as well as the impact of citigroup’s own credit risk on derivatives and other liabilities measured at fair value 

fair value hierarchy 

asc 82010 specifies a hierarchy of inputs based on whether the inputs are observable or unobservable observable inputs are developed using market data and reflect market participant assumptions while unobservable inputs reflect the company’s market assumptions these two types of inputs have created the following fair value hierarchy 

 

as required under the fair value hierarchy the company considers relevant and observable market inputs in its valuations where possible the frequency of transactions the size of the bidask spread and the amount of adjustment necessary when comparing similar transactions are all factors in determining the relevance of observed prices in those markets 

determination of fair value 

for assets and liabilities carried at fair value the company measures fair value using the procedures set out below irrespective of whether the assets and liabilities are measured at fair value as a result of an election or whether they are required to be measured at fair value 

when available the company uses quoted market prices to determine fair value and classifies such items as level 1 in some specific cases where a market price is available the company will make use of acceptable practical expedients such as matrix pricing to calculate fair value in which case the items are classified as level 2 

 

the company may also apply a pricebased methodology which utilizes where available quoted prices or other market information obtained from recent trading activity in positions with the same or similar characteristics to the position being valued the frequency and size of transactions are among the factors that are driven by the liquidity of markets and determine the relevance of observed prices in those markets if relevant and observable prices are available those valuations may be classified as level 2 when that is not the case and there are one or more significant unobservable “price” inputs then those valuations will be classified as level 3 furthermore when less liquidity exists for a security or loan a quoted price is stale a significant adjustment to the price of a similar security is necessary to reflect differences in the terms of the actual security or loan being valued or prices from independent sources are insufficient to corroborate the valuation the “price” inputs are considered unobservable and the fair value measurements are classified as level 3 

if quoted market prices are not available fair value is based upon internally developed valuation techniques that use where possible current marketbased parameters such as interest rates currency rates and option volatilities items valued using such internally generated valuation techniques are classified according to the lowest level input or value driver that is significant to the valuation thus an item may be classified as level 3 even though there may be some significant inputs that are readily observable 

fair value estimates from internal valuation techniques are verified where possible to prices obtained from independent vendors or brokers vendors’ and brokers’ valuations may be based on a variety of inputs ranging from observed prices to proprietary valuation models and the company assesses the quality and relevance of this information in determining the estimate of fair value the following section describes the valuation methodologies used by the company to measure various financial instruments at fair value including an indication of the level in the fair value hierarchy in which each instrument is generally classified where appropriate the description includes details of the valuation models the key inputs to those models and any significant assumptions 

market valuation adjustments 

generally the unit of account for a financial instrument is the individual financial instrument the company applies market valuation adjustments that are consistent with the unit of account which does not include adjustment due to the size of the company’s position except as follows asc 82010 permits an exception through an accounting policy election to measure the fair value of a portfolio of financial assets and financial liabilities on the basis of the net open risk position when certain criteria are met citi has elected to measure certain portfolios of financial instruments that meet those criteria such as derivatives on the basis of the net open risk position the company applies market valuation adjustments including adjustments to account for the size of the net open risk position consistent with market participant assumptions 

valuation adjustments are applied to items classified as level 2 or level 3 in the fair value hierarchy to ensure that the fair value reflects the price at which the net open risk position could be exited these valuation adjustments are based on the bidoffer spread for an instrument in the market when citi has elected to measure certain portfolios of financial investments such as derivatives on the basis of the net open risk position the valuation adjustment may take into account the size of the position 

credit valuation adjustments cva and funding valuation adjustments fva are applied to the relevant population of overthecounter otc derivative instruments where adjustments to reflect counterparty credit risk own credit risk and term funding risk are required to estimate fair value this principally includes derivatives with a base valuation eg discounted using overnight indexed swap ois requiring adjustment for these effects such as uncollateralized interest rate swaps the cva represents a portfoliolevel adjustment to reflect the risk premium associated with the counterparty’s assets or citi’s liabilities nonperformance risk 

fva reflect a market funding risk premium inherent in the uncollateralized portion of a derivative portfolio and in certain collateralized derivative portfolios that do not include standard credit support annexes csas such as where the csa does not permit the reuse of collateral received citi’s fva methodology leverages the existing cva methodology to estimate a funding exposure profile the calculation of this exposure profile considers collateral agreements in which the terms do not permit the company to reuse the collateral received including where counterparties post collateral to thirdparty custodians 

citi’s cva and fva methodology consists of two steps 



 

cva is determined using cds spread indices for each credit rating and tenor for certain identified netting sets where individual analysis is practicable eg exposures to counterparties with liquid cdss counterpartyspecific cds spreads are used for fva a term structure of future liquidity spreads is applied to the expected future funding requirement 

the cva and fva are designed to incorporate a market view of the credit and funding risk respectively inherent in the derivative portfolio however most unsecured derivative instruments are negotiated bilateral contracts and are not commonly transferred to third parties derivative instruments are normally settled contractually or if terminated early are terminated at a value negotiated bilaterally between the counterparties thus the cva and fva may not be realized upon a settlement or termination in the normal course of business in addition all or a portion of these adjustments may be reversed or otherwise adjusted in future periods in the event of changes in the credit or funding risk associated with the derivative instruments 

the table below summarizes the cva and fva applied to the fair value of derivative instruments at december 31 2018 and 2017 



 

the table below summarizes pretax gains losses related to changes in cva on derivative instruments net of hedges fva on derivatives and debt valuation adjustments dva on citi’s own fair value option fvo liabilities for the years indicated 





 

securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under agreements to repurchase 

no quoted prices exist for these instruments so fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow technique cash flows are estimated based on the terms of the contract taking into account any embedded derivative or other features these cash flows are discounted using interest rates appropriate to the maturity of the instrument as well as the nature of the underlying collateral generally when such instruments are recorded at fair value they are classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as the inputs used in the valuation are readily observable however certain longdated positions are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy 

trading account assets and liabilities—trading securities and trading loans 

when available the company uses quoted market prices in active markets to determine the fair value of trading securities such items are classified as level 1 of the fair value hierarchy examples include government securities and exchangetraded equity securities 

for bonds and secondary market loans traded over the counter the company generally determines fair value utilizing valuation techniques including discounted cash flows pricebased and internal models fair value estimates from these internal valuation techniques are verified where possible to prices obtained from independent sources including thirdparty vendors vendors compile prices from various sources and may apply matrix pricing for similar bonds or loans where no price is observable a pricebased methodology utilizes where available quoted prices or other market information obtained from recent trading activity of assets with similar characteristics to the bond or loan being valued the yields used in discounted cash flow models are derived from the same price information trading securities and loans priced using such methods are generally classified as level 2 however when less liquidity exists for a security or loan a quoted price is stale a significant adjustment to the price of a similar security or loan is necessary to reflect differences in the terms of the actual security or loan being valued or prices from independent sources are insufficient to corroborate valuation a loan or security is generally classified as level 3 the price input used in a pricebased methodology may be zero for a security such as a subprime cdo that is not receiving any principal or interest and is currently written down to zero 

when the company’s principal market for a portfolio of loans is the securitization market the company uses the securitization price to determine the fair value of the portfolio the securitization price is determined from the assumed proceeds of a hypothetical securitization in the current market adjusted for transformation costs ie direct costs other than transaction costs and securitization uncertainties such as market conditions and liquidity as a result of the severe reduction in the level of activity in certain securitization markets since the second half of 2007 

 

observable securitization prices for certain directly comparable portfolios of loans have not been readily available therefore such portfolios of loans are generally classified as level 3 of the fair value hierarchy however for other loan securitization markets such as commercial real estate loans price verification of the hypothetical securitizations has been possible since these markets have remained active accordingly this loan portfolio is classified as level 2 of the fair value hierarchy 

for most of the lending and structured direct subprime exposures fair value is determined utilizing observable transactions where available other market data for similar assets in markets that are not active and other internal valuation techniques the valuation of certain assetbacked security abs cdo positions utilizes prices based on the underlying assets of the abs cdo 

trading account assets and liabilities—derivatives 

exchangetraded derivatives measured at fair value using quoted ie exchange prices in active markets where available are classified as level 1 of the fair value hierarchy 

derivatives without a quoted price in an active market and derivatives executed over the counter are valued using internal valuation techniques these derivative instruments are classified as either level 2 or level 3 depending on the observability of the significant inputs to the model 

the valuation techniques depend on the type of derivative and the nature of the underlying instrument the principal techniques used to value these instruments are discounted cash flows and internal models such as derivative pricing models eg blackscholes and monte carlo simulations 

the key inputs depend upon the type of derivative and the nature of the underlying instrument and include interest rate yield curves foreign exchange rates volatilities and correlation the company typically uses ois curves as fair value measurement inputs for the valuation of certain derivatives 

investments 

the investments category includes availableforsale debt and marketable equity securities whose fair values are generally determined by utilizing similar procedures described for trading securities above or in some cases using vendor pricing as the primary source 

also included in investments are nonpublic investments in private equity and real estate entities determining the fair value of nonpublic securities involves a significant degree of management judgment as no quoted prices exist and such securities are generally thinly traded in addition there may be transfer restrictions on private equity securities the company’s process for determining the fair value of such securities utilizes commonly accepted valuation techniques including comparables analysis in determining the fair value of nonpublic securities the company also considers events such as a proposed sale of the investee company initial public offerings equity issuances or other observable transactions private equity securities are generally classified as level 3 of the fair value hierarchy 

in addition the company holds investments in certain alternative investment funds that calculate nav per share including hedge funds private equity funds and real estate funds investments in funds are generally classified as nonmarketable equity securities carried at fair value the fair values of these investments are estimated using the nav per share of the company’s ownership interest in the funds where it is not probable that the investment will be realized at a price other than the nav consistent with the provisions of asu 201507 these investments have not been categorized within the fair value hierarchy and are not included in the tables below see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

shortterm borrowings and longterm debt 

where fair value accounting has been elected the fair value of nonstructured liabilities is determined by utilizing internal models using the appropriate discount rate for the applicable maturity such instruments are generally classified as level 2 of the fair value hierarchy when all significant inputs are readily observable 

the company determines the fair value of hybrid financial instruments including structured liabilities using the appropriate derivative valuation methodology described above in “trading account assets and liabilities—derivatives” given the nature of the embedded risk profile such instruments are classified as level 2 or level 3 depending on the observability of significant inputs to the model 

items measured at fair value on a recurring basis 

the following tables present for each of the fair value hierarchy levels the company’s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis at december 31 2018  and 2017 the company may hedge positions that have been classified in the level 3 category with other financial 

 

instruments hedging instruments that may be classified as level 3 but also with financial instruments classified as level 1 or level 2 of the fair value hierarchy the effects of these hedges are presented gross in the following tables

changes in level 3 fair value category 

the following tables present the changes in the level 3 fair value category for the years ended   december 31 2018  and 2017  the gains and losses presented below include changes in the fair value related to both observable and unobservable inputs 

the company often hedges positions with offsetting positions that are classified in a different level for example the gains and losses for assets and liabilities in the level 3 

 

category presented in the tables below do not reflect the effect of offsetting losses and gains on hedging instruments that may be classified in the level 1 and level 2 categories in addition the company hedges items classified in the level 3 category with instruments also classified in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy the hedged items and related hedges are presented gross in the following tables

valuation techniques and inputs for level 3 fair 

value measurements 

the company’s level 3 inventory consists of both cash 

instruments and derivatives of varying complexity the 

valuation methodologies used to measure the fair value of 

these positions include discounted cash flow analysis internal 

models and comparative analysis a position is classified 

within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy when at least one 

input is unobservable and is considered significant to its 

valuation the specific reason an input is deemed 

unobservable varies for example at least one significant 

input to the pricing model is not observable in the market at 

 

least one significant input has been adjusted to make it more 

representative of the position being valued or the price quote 

available does not reflect sufficient trading activities 

the following tables present the valuation techniques covering the majority of level 3 inventory and the most significant unobservable inputs used in level 3 fair value measurements differences between this table and amounts presented in the level 3 fair value rollforward table represent individually immaterial items that have been measured using a variety of valuation techniques other than those listed 









 

uncertainty of fair value measurements relating to unobservable inputs 

valuation uncertainty arises when there is insufficient or disperse market data to allow a precise determination of the exit value of a fairvalued position or portfolio in today’s market this is especially prevalent in level 3 fair value instruments where uncertainty exists in valuation inputs that may be both unobservable and significant to the instrument’s or portfolio’s overall fair value measurement the uncertainties associated with key unobservable inputs on the level 3 fair value measurements may not be independent of one another in addition the amount and direction of the uncertainty on a fair value measurement for a given change in an unobservable input depends on the nature of the instrument as well as whether the company holds the instrument as an asset or a liability for certain instruments the pricing hedging and risk management are sensitive to the correlation between various inputs rather than on the analysis and aggregation of the individual inputs 

the following section describes some of the most significant unobservable inputs used by the company in level 3 fair value measurements 

correlation 

correlation is a measure of the extent to which two or more variables change in relation to each other a variety of correlationrelated assumptions are required for a wide range of instruments including equity and credit baskets foreign exchange options cdos backed by loans or bonds mortgages subprime mortgages and many other instruments for almost all of these instruments correlations are not directly observable in the market and must be calculated using alternative sources including historical information estimating correlation can be especially difficult where it may vary over time and calculating correlation information from market data requires significant assumptions regarding the informational efficiency of the market eg swaption markets uncertainty therefore exists when an estimate of the appropriate level of correlation as an input into some fair value measurements is required 

changes in correlation levels can have a substantial impact favorable or unfavorable on the value of an instrument depending on its nature a change in the default correlation of the fair value of the underlying bonds comprising a cdo structure would affect the fair value of the senior tranche for example an increase in the default correlation of the underlying bonds would reduce the fair value of the senior tranche because highly correlated instruments produce greater losses in the event of default and a portion of these losses would become attributable to the senior tranche that same change in default correlation would have a different impact on junior tranches of the same structure 

volatility 

volatility represents the speed and severity of market price changes and is a key factor in pricing options volatility generally depends on the tenor of the underlying instrument and the strike price or level defined in the contract volatilities 

 

for certain combinations of tenor and strike are not observable and need to be estimated using alternative methods such as using comparable instruments historical analysis or other sources of market information this leads to uncertainty around the final fair value measurement of instruments with unobservable volatilities 

the general relationship between changes in the value of a portfolio to changes in volatility also depends on changes in interest rates and the level of the underlying index generally long option positions assets benefit from increases in volatility whereas short option positions liabilities will suffer losses some instruments are more sensitive to changes in volatility than others for example an atthemoney option would experience a greater percentage change in its fair value than a deepinthemoney option in addition the fair value of an option with more than one underlying security eg an option on a basket of bonds depends on the volatility of the individual underlying securities as well as their correlations 

yield 

in some circumstances the yield of an instrument is not observable in the market and must be estimated from historical data or from yields of similar securities this estimated yield may need to be adjusted to capture the characteristics of the security being valued in other situations the estimated yield may not represent sufficient market liquidity and must be adjusted as well whenever the amount of the adjustment is significant to the value of the security the fair value measurement is classified as level 3 

adjusted yield is generally used to discount the projected future principal and interest cash flows on instruments such as assetbacked securities adjusted yield is impacted by changes in the interest rate environment and relevant credit spreads 

prepayment 

voluntary unscheduled payments prepayments change the future cash flows for the investor and thereby change the fair value of the security the effect of prepayments is more pronounced for residential mortgagebacked securities an increase in prepayments—in speed or magnitude—generally creates losses for the holder of these securities prepayment is generally negatively correlated with delinquency and interest rate a combination of low prepayment and high delinquencies amplifies each input’s negative impact on mortgage securities’ valuation as prepayment speeds change the weighted average life of the security changes which impacts the valuation either positively or negatively depending upon the nature of the security and the direction of the change in the weighted average life 

recovery 

recovery is the proportion of the total outstanding balance of a bond or loan that is expected to be collected in a liquidation scenario for many credit securities such as assetbacked securities there is no directly observable market input for recovery but indications of recovery levels are available from pricing services the assumed recovery of a security may differ from its actual recovery that will be observable in the future the recovery rate impacts the valuation of credit 

securities generally an increase in the recovery rate assumption increases the fair value of the security an increase in loss severity the inverse of the recovery rate reduces the amount of principal available for distribution and as a result decreases the fair value of the security 

credit spread 

credit spread is a component of the security representing its credit quality credit spread reflects the market perception of changes in prepayment delinquency and recovery rates therefore capturing the impact of other variables on the fair value changes in credit spread affect the fair value of 

securities differently depending on the characteristics and maturity profile of the security for example credit spread is a more significant driver of the fair value measurement of a high yield bond as compared to an investment grade bond generally the credit spread for an investment grade bond is also more observable and less volatile than its high yield counterpart 

items measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis 

certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and therefore are not included in the tables above these include assets measured at cost that have been written down to fair value during the periods as a result of an impairment these also include nonmarketable equity securities that have been measured using the measurement alternative and are either i written down to fair value during the periods as a result of an impairment or ii adjusted upward or downward to fair value as a result of a transaction observed during the periods for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer in addition these assets include loans hfs and other real estate owned that are measured at the lower of cost or market 

the following tables present the carrying amounts of all assets that were still held for which a nonrecurring fair value measurement was recorded 





 

the fair value of loans hfs is determined where possible using quoted secondarymarket prices if no such quoted price exists the fair value of a loan is determined using quoted prices for a similar asset or assets adjusted for the specific attributes of that loan fair value for the other real estate owned is based on appraisals for loans whose carrying amount is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral the fair values depend on the type of collateral fair value of the collateral is typically estimated based on quoted market prices if available appraisals or other internal valuation techniques 

where the fair value of the related collateral is based on an unadjusted appraised value the loan is generally classified as level 2 where significant adjustments are made to the appraised value the loan is classified as level 3 additionally 

 

for corporate loans appraisals of the collateral are often based on sales of similar assets however because the prices of similar assets require significant adjustments to reflect the unique features of the underlying collateral these fair value measurements are generally classified as level 3 

the fair value of nonmarketable equity securities under the measurement alternative is based on observed transaction prices for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer or an internal valuation technique in the case of an impairment where significant adjustments are made to the observed transaction price or when an internal valuation technique is used the security is classified as level 3 fair value may differ from the observed transaction price due to a number of factors including marketability adjustments and differences in rights and obligations when the observed transaction is not for the identical investment held by citi

guarantees 

citi provides a variety of guarantees and indemnifications to its customers to enhance their credit standing and enable them to complete a wide variety of business transactions for 

certain contracts meeting the definition of a guarantee the guarantor must recognize at inception a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 

in addition the guarantor must disclose the maximum potential amount of future payments that the guarantor could be required to make under the guarantee if there were a total 

default by the guaranteed parties the determination of the maximum potential future payments is based on the notional amount of the guarantees without consideration of possible recoveries under recourse provisions or from collateral held or pledged as such citi believes such amounts bear no relationship to the anticipated losses if any on these guarantees 

the following tables present information about citi’s guarantees 





 

financial standby letters of credit 

citi issues standby letters of credit which substitute its own credit for that of the borrower if a letter of credit is drawn down the borrower is obligated to repay citi standby letters of credit protect a third party from defaults on contractual obligations financial standby letters of credit include i guarantees of payment of insurance premiums and reinsurance risks that support industrial revenue bond underwriting ii settlement of payment obligations to clearing houses including futures and overthecounter derivatives clearing see further discussion below iii support options and purchases of securities in lieu of escrow deposit accounts and iv letters of credit that backstop loans credit facilities promissory notes and trade acceptances 

 

performance guarantees 

performance guarantees and letters of credit are issued to guarantee a customer’s tender bid on a construction or systemsinstallation project or to guarantee completion of such projects in accordance with contract terms they are also issued to support a customer’s obligation to supply specified products commodities or maintenance or warranty services to a third party 

derivative instruments considered to be guarantees 

derivatives are financial instruments whose cash flows are based on a notional amount and an underlying instrument reference credit or index where there is little or no initial investment and whose terms require or permit net settlement for a discussion of citi’s derivatives activities see note 22 to the consolidated financial statements 

derivative instruments considered to be guarantees include only those instruments that require citi to make payments to the counterparty based on changes in an underlying instrument that is related to an asset a liability or an equity security held by the guaranteed party more specifically derivative instruments considered to be 

guarantees include certain overthecounter written put options where the counterparty is not a bank hedge fund or brokerdealer such counterparties are considered to be dealers in these markets and may therefore not hold the underlying instruments credit derivatives sold by citi are excluded from the tables above as they are disclosed separately in note 22 to the consolidated financial statements in instances where citi’s maximum potential future payment is unlimited the notional amount of the contract is disclosed 

loans sold with recourse 

loans sold with recourse represent citi’s obligations to reimburse the buyers for loan losses under certain circumstances recourse refers to the clause in a sales agreement under which a sellerlender will fully reimburse the buyerinvestor for any losses resulting from the purchased loans this may be accomplished by the seller taking back any loans that become delinquent 

in addition to the amounts shown in the tables above citi has recorded a repurchase reserve for its potential repurchases or makewhole liability regarding residential mortgage representation and warranty claims related to its whole loan sales to the us governmentsponsored enterprises gses and to a lesser extent private investors the repurchase reserve was approximately 49 million  and 66 million  at december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively and these amounts are included in other liabilities  on the consolidated balance sheet 

securities lending indemnifications 

owners of securities frequently lend those securities for a fee to other parties who may sell them short or deliver them to another party to satisfy some other obligation banks may administer such securities lending programs for their clients securities lending indemnifications are issued by the bank to guarantee that a securities lending customer will be made whole in the event that the security borrower does not return the security subject to the lending agreement and collateral held is insufficient to cover the market value of the security 

credit card merchant processing 

credit card merchant processing guarantees represent the company’s indirect obligations in connection with i providing transaction processing services to various merchants with respect to its private label cards and ii potential liability for bank card transaction processing services the nature of the liability in either case arises as a result of a billing dispute between a merchant and a cardholder that is ultimately resolved in the cardholder’s favor the merchant is liable to refund the amount to the cardholder in general if the credit card processing company is unable to collect this amount from the merchant the credit card processing company bears the loss for the amount of the credit or refund paid to the cardholder 

with regard to i above citi has the primary contingent liability with respect to its portfolio of private label merchants the risk of loss is mitigated as the cash flows between citi and the merchant are settled on a net basis and 

 

citi has the right to offset any payments with cash flows otherwise due to the merchant to further mitigate this risk citi may delay settlement require a merchant to make an escrow deposit include event triggers to provide citi with more financial and operational control in the event of the financial deterioration of the merchant or require various credit enhancements including letters of credit and bank guarantees in the unlikely event that a private label merchant is unable to deliver products services or a refund to its private label cardholders citi is contingently liable to credit or refund cardholders 

with regard to ii above citi has a potential liability for bank card transactions where citi provides the transaction processing services as well as those where a third party provides the services and citi acts as a secondary guarantor should that processor fail to perform 

citi’s maximum potential contingent liability related to both bank card and private label merchant processing services is estimated to be the total volume of credit card transactions that meet the requirements to be valid chargeback transactions at any given time at december 31 2018  and 2017  this maximum potential exposure was estimated to be 95 billion  and 86 billion  respectively 

however citi believes that the maximum exposure is not representative of the actual potential loss exposure based on its historical experience this contingent liability is unlikely to arise as most products and services are delivered when purchased and amounts are refunded when items are returned to merchants citi assesses the probability and amount of its contingent liability related to merchant processing based on the financial strength of the primary guarantor the extent and nature of unresolved chargebacks and its historical loss experience at december 31 2018  and 2017  the losses incurred and the carrying amounts of citi’s contingent obligations related to merchant processing activities were immaterial 

credit card arrangements with partners 

citi in certain of its credit card partner arrangements provides guarantees to the partner regarding the volume of certain customer originations during the term of the agreement to the extent that such origination targets are not met the guarantees serve to compensate the partner for certain payments that otherwise would have been generated in connection with such originations 

custody indemnifications 

custody indemnifications are issued to guarantee that custody clients will be made whole in the event that a thirdparty subcustodian or depository institution fails to safeguard clients’ assets 

other guarantees and indemnifications 

credit card protection programs 

citi through its credit card businesses provides various 

cardholder protection programs on several of its card 

products including programs that provide insurance 

coverage for rental cars coverage for certain losses 

associated with purchased products price protection for 

certain purchases and protection for lost luggage these 

guarantees are not included in the table since the total 

outstanding amount of the guarantees and citi’s maximum 

exposure to loss cannot be quantified the protection is 

limited to certain types of purchases and losses and it is not 

possible to quantify the purchases that would qualify for 

these benefits at any given time citi assesses the probability 

and amount of its potential liability related to these programs 

based on the extent and nature of its historical loss 

experience at december 31 2018 and 2017 the actual and estimated losses incurred and the carrying value 

of citi’s obligations related to these programs were 

immaterial 

other representation and warranty indemnifications 

in the normal course of business citi provides standard representations and warranties to counterparties in contracts in connection with numerous transactions and also provides indemnifications including indemnifications that protect the counterparties to the contracts in the event that additional taxes are owed due either to a change in the tax law or an adverse interpretation of the tax law counterparties to these transactions provide citi with comparable indemnifications while such representations warranties and indemnifications are essential components of many contractual relationships they do not represent the underlying business purpose for the transactions the indemnification clauses are often standard contractual terms related to citi’s own performance under the terms of a contract and are entered into in the normal course of business based on an assessment that the risk of loss is remote often these clauses are intended to ensure that terms of a contract are met at inception no  compensation is received for these standard representations and warranties and it is not possible to determine their fair value because they rarely if ever result in a payment in many cases there are no  stated or notional amounts included in the indemnification clauses and the contingencies potentially triggering the obligation to indemnify have not occurred and are not expected to occur as a result these indemnifications are not included in the tables above 

valuetransfer networks vtns 

citi is a member of or shareholder in hundreds of valuetransfer networks vtns payment clearing and settlement systems as well as exchanges around the world as a condition of membership many of these vtns require that members stand ready to pay a pro rata share of the losses incurred by the organization due to another member’s default on its obligations citi’s potential obligations may be limited to its membership interests in the vtns contributions to a vtn’s funds or in limited cases the obligation may be 

 

unlimited the maximum exposure cannot be estimated as this would require an assessment of future claims that have not yet occurred citi believes the risk of loss is remote given historical experience with the vtns accordingly citi’s participation in vtns is not reported in the guarantees tables above and there are no  amounts reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2018  or 2017  for potential obligations that could arise from citi’s involvement with vtns associations 

longterm care insurance indemnification 

in 2000 travelers life  annuity travelers then a subsidiary of citi entered into a reinsurance agreement to transfer the risks and rewards of its longterm care ltc business to ge life now genworth financial inc or genworth then a subsidiary of the general electric company ge as part of this transaction the reinsurance obligations were provided by two regulated insurance subsidiaries of ge life which funded two  collateral trusts with securities presently as discussed below the trusts are referred to as the genworth trusts 

as part of ge’s spinoff of genworth in 2004 ge retained the risks and rewards associated with the 2000 travelers reinsurance agreement by providing a reinsurance contract to genworth through its union fidelity life insurance company uflic subsidiary that covers the travelers ltc policies in addition ge provided a capital maintenance agreement in favor of uflic which is designed to assure that uflic will have the funds to pay its reinsurance obligations as a result of these reinsurance agreements and the spinoff of genworth genworth has reinsurance protection from uflic supported by ge and has reinsurance obligations in connection with the travelers ltc policies as noted below the genworth reinsurance obligations now benefit brighthouse financial inc brighthouse while neither brighthouse nor citi are direct beneficiaries of the capital maintenance agreement between ge and uflic brighthouse and citi benefit indirectly from the existence of the capital maintenance agreement which helps assure that uflic will continue to have funds necessary to pay its reinsurance obligations to genworth 

in connection with citi’s 2005 sale of travelers to metlife inc metlife citi provided an indemnification to metlife for losses including policyholder claims relating to the ltc business for the entire term of the travelers ltc policies which as noted above are reinsured by subsidiaries of genworth in 2017 metlife spun off its retail insurance business to brighthouse as a result the travelers ltc policies now reside with brighthouse the original reinsurance agreement between travelers now brighthouse and genworth remains in place and brighthouse is the sole beneficiary of the genworth trusts the fair value of the genworth trusts is approximately 75 billion  as of december 31 2018 and 2017 the genworth trusts are designed to provide collateral to brighthouse in an amount equal to the statutory liabilities of brighthouse in respect of the travelers ltc policies the assets in the genworth trusts are evaluated and adjusted periodically to ensure that the fair value of the assets continues to provide collateral in 

an amount equal to these estimated statutory liabilities as the liabilities change over time 

if both i genworth fails to perform under the original travelersge life reinsurance agreement for any reason including insolvency or the failure of uflic to perform in a timely manner and ii the assets of the two genworth trusts are insufficient or unavailable then citi through its ltc reinsurance indemnification must reimburse brighthouse for any losses incurred in connection with the ltc policies since both events would have to occur before citi would become responsible for any payment to brighthouse pursuant to its indemnification obligation and the likelihood of such events occurring is currently not probable there is no  liability reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2018 and 2017 related to this indemnification citi continues to closely monitor its potential exposure under this indemnification obligation 

separately genworth announced that it had agreed to be purchased by china oceanwide holdings co ltd subject to a series of conditions and regulatory approvals citi is monitoring these developments 

futures and overthecounter derivatives clearing 

citi provides clearing services on central clearing parties ccps for clients that need to clear exchange traded and overthecounter otc derivatives contracts based on all relevant facts and circumstances citi has concluded that it acts as an agent for accounting purposes in its role as clearing member for these client transactions as such citi does not reflect the underlying exchange traded or otc derivatives contracts in its consolidated financial statements see note 22 for a discussion of citi’s derivatives activities that are reflected in its consolidated financial statements 

as a clearing member citi collects and remits cash and securities collateral margin between its clients and the respective ccp in certain circumstances citi collects a higher amount of cash or securities from its clients than it needs to remit to the ccps this excess cash is then held at depository institutions such as banks or carry brokers 

there are two  types of margin initial and variation where citi obtains benefits from or controls cash initial margin eg retains an interest spread cash initial margin collected from clients and remitted to the ccp or depository institutions is reflected within brokerage payables  payables to customers and brokerage receivables  receivables from brokers dealers and clearing organizations or cash and due from banks  respectively 

however for exchange traded and otccleared derivatives contracts where citi does not obtain benefits from or control the client cash balances the client cash initial margin collected from clients and remitted to the ccp or depository institutions is not reflected on citi’s consolidated balance sheet these conditions are met when citi has contractually agreed with the client that i citi will pass through to the client all interest paid by the ccp or depository institutions on the cash initial margin ii citi will not utilize its right as a clearing member to transform cash margin into other assets iii citi does not guarantee 

 

and is not liable to the client for the performance of the ccp or the depository institution and iv the client cash balances are legally isolated from citi’s bankruptcy estate the total amount of cash initial margin collected and remitted in this manner was approximately 138 billion  and 107 billion  as of december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively 

variation margin due from clients to the respective ccp or from the ccp to clients reflects changes in the value of the client’s derivative contracts for each trading day as a clearing member citi is exposed to the risk of nonperformance by clients eg failure of a client to post variation margin to the ccp for negative changes in the value of the client’s derivative contracts in the event of nonperformance by a client citi would move to close out the client’s positions the ccp would typically utilize initial margin posted by the client and held by the ccp with any remaining shortfalls required to be paid by citi as clearing member citi generally holds incremental cash or securities margin posted by the client which would typically be expected to be sufficient to mitigate citi’s credit risk in the event that the client fails to perform 

 as required by asc 86030255 securities collateral posted by clients is not recognized on citi’s consolidated balance sheet 

carrying value—guarantees and indemnifications 

at december 31 2018  and 2017  the total carrying amounts of the liabilities related to the guarantees and indemnifications included in the tables above amounted to approximately 09 billion  and  08 billion  respectively the carrying value of financial and performance guarantees is included in other liabilities for loans sold with recourse the carrying value of the liability is included in other liabilities  

collateral 

cash collateral available to citi to reimburse losses realized under these guarantees and indemnifications amounted to 55 billion  and 46 billion  at december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively securities and other marketable assets held as collateral amounted to 55 billion  and 70 billion  at december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively the majority of collateral is held to reimburse losses realized under securities lending indemnifications additionally letters of credit in favor of citi held as collateral amounted to 41 billion  and 37 billion  at december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively other property may also be available to citi to cover losses under certain guarantees and indemnifications however the value of such property has not been determined 

performance risk 

citi evaluates the performance risk of its guarantees based on the assigned referenced counterparty internal or external ratings where external ratings are used investmentgrade ratings are considered to be baabbb and above while anything below is considered noninvestment grade citi’s internal ratings are in line with the related external rating system on certain underlying referenced assets or entities ratings are not available such referenced assets are included in the “not rated” category the maximum potential amount of the future payments related to the outstanding guarantees is determined to be the notional amount of these contracts which is the par amount of the assets guaranteed 

 

presented in the tables below are the maximum potential amounts of future payments that are classified based upon internal and external credit ratings as previously mentioned the determination of the maximum potential future payments is based on the notional amount of the guarantees without consideration of possible recoveries under recourse provisions or from collateral held or pledged as such citi believes such amounts bear no relationship to the anticipated losses if any on these guarantees 





credit commitments and lines of credit 

the table below summarizes citigroup’s credit commitments 



the majority of unused commitments are contingent upon customers maintaining specific credit standards 

commercial commitments generally have floating interest rates and fixed expiration dates and may require payment of fees such fees net of certain direct costs are deferred and upon exercise of the commitment amortized over the life of the loan or if exercise is deemed remote amortized over the commitment period

27 contingencies 

accounting and disclosure framework 

asc 450 governs the disclosure and recognition of loss contingencies including potential losses from litigation and regulatory matters asc 450 defines a “loss contingency” as “an existing condition situation or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss to an entity that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur” it imposes different requirements for the recognition and disclosure of loss contingencies based on the likelihood of occurrence of the contingent future event or events it distinguishes among degrees of likelihood using the following three terms “probable” meaning that “the future event or events are likely to occur” “remote” meaning that “the chance of the future event or events occurring is slight” and “reasonably possible” meaning that “the chance of the future event or events occurring is more than remote but less than likely” these three terms are used below as defined in asc 450 

accruals  asc 450 requires accrual for a loss contingency when it is “probable that one or more future events will occur confirming the fact of loss” and  “the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated” in accordance with asc 450 citigroup establishes accruals for contingencies including the litigation and regulatory matters disclosed herein when citigroup believes it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated when the reasonable estimate of the loss is within a range of amounts the minimum amount of the range is accrued unless some higher amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range once established accruals are adjusted from time to time as appropriate in light of additional information the amount of loss ultimately incurred in relation to those matters may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts accrued for those matters 

disclosure  asc 450 requires disclosure of a loss contingency if “there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may have been incurred” and  there is no accrual for the loss because the conditions described above are not met or an exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount accrued in accordance with asc 450 if citigroup has not accrued for a matter because citigroup believes that a loss is reasonably possible but not probable or that a loss is probable but not reasonably estimable and the reasonably possible loss is material it discloses the loss contingency in addition citigroup discloses matters for which it has accrued if it believes a reasonably possible exposure to material loss exists in excess of the amount accrued in accordance with asc 450 citigroup’s disclosure includes an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss for those matters as to which an estimate can be made asc 450 does not require disclosure of an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss where an estimate cannot be made neither accrual nor disclosure is required for losses that are deemed remote 

 

litigation and regulatory contingencies 

overview  in addition to the matters described below in the ordinary course of business citigroup its affiliates and subsidiaries and current and former officers directors and employees for purposes of this section sometimes collectively referred to as citigroup and related parties routinely are named as defendants in or as parties to various legal actions and proceedings certain of these actions and proceedings assert claims or seek relief in connection with alleged violations of consumer protection fair lending securities banking antifraud antitrust antimoney laundering employment and other statutory and common laws certain of these actual or threatened legal actions and proceedings include claims for substantial or indeterminate compensatory or punitive damages or for injunctive relief and in some instances seek recovery on a classwide basis 

in the ordinary course of business citigroup and related parties also are subject to governmental and regulatory examinations informationgathering requests investigations and proceedings both formal and informal certain of which may result in adverse judgments settlements fines penalties restitution disgorgement injunctions or other relief in addition certain affiliates and subsidiaries of citigroup are banks registered brokerdealers futures commission merchants investment advisors or other regulated entities and in those capacities are subject to regulation by various us state and foreign securities banking commodity futures consumer protection and other regulators in connection with formal and informal inquiries by these regulators citigroup and such affiliates and subsidiaries receive numerous requests subpoenas and orders seeking documents testimony and other information in connection with various aspects of their regulated activities from time to time citigroup and related parties also receive grand jury subpoenas and other requests for information or assistance formal or informal from federal or state law enforcement agencies including among others various united states attorneys’ offices the asset forfeiture and money laundering section and other divisions of the department of justice the financial crimes enforcement network of the united states department of the treasury and the federal bureau of investigation relating to citigroup and its customers 

because of the global scope of citigroup’s operations and its presence in countries around the world citigroup and related parties are subject to litigation and governmental and regulatory examinations informationgathering requests investigations and proceedings both formal and informal in multiple jurisdictions with legal and regulatory regimes that may differ substantially and present substantially different risks from those citigroup and related parties are subject to in the united states in some instances citigroup and related parties may be involved in proceedings involving the same subject matter in multiple jurisdictions which may result in overlapping cumulative or inconsistent outcomes 

citigroup seeks to resolve all litigation and regulatory matters in the manner management believes is in the best interests of citigroup and its shareholders and contests liability allegations of wrongdoing and where applicable the 

amount of damages or scope of any penalties or other relief sought as appropriate in each pending matter 

inherent uncertainty of the matters disclosed  certain of the matters disclosed below involve claims for substantial or indeterminate damages the claims asserted in these matters typically are broad often spanning a multiyear period and sometimes a wide range of business activities and the plaintiffs’ or claimants’ alleged damages frequently are not quantified or factually supported in the complaint or statement of claim other matters relate to regulatory investigations or proceedings as to which there may be no objective basis for quantifying the range of potential fine penalty or other remedy as a result citigroup is often unable to estimate the loss in such matters even if it believes that a loss is probable or reasonably possible until developments in the case or investigation have yielded additional information sufficient to support a quantitative assessment of the range of reasonably possible loss such developments may include among other things discovery from adverse parties or third parties rulings by the court on key issues analysis by retained experts and engagement in settlement negotiations depending on a range of factors such as the complexity of the facts the novelty of the legal theories the pace of discovery the court’s scheduling order the timing of court decisions and the adverse party’s willingness to negotiate in good faith toward a resolution it may be months or years after the filing of a case or commencement of an investigation before an estimate of the range of reasonably possible loss can be made 

matters as to which an estimate can be made  for some of the matters disclosed below citigroup is currently able to estimate a reasonably possible loss or range of loss in excess of amounts accrued if any for some of the matters included within this estimation an accrual has been made because a loss is believed to be both probable and reasonably estimable but an exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount accrued in these cases the estimate reflects the reasonably possible range of loss in excess of the accrued amount for other matters included within this estimation no accrual has been made because a loss although estimable is believed to be reasonably possible but not probable in these cases the estimate reflects the reasonably possible loss or range of loss as of december 31 2018 citigroup estimates that the reasonably possible unaccrued loss for these matters ranges up to approximately 10 billion  in the aggregate 

these estimates are based on currently available information as available information changes the matters for which citigroup is able to estimate will change and the estimates themselves will change in addition while many estimates presented in financial statements and other financial disclosures involve significant judgment and may be subject to significant uncertainty estimates of the range of reasonably possible loss arising from litigation and regulatory proceedings are subject to particular uncertainties for example at the time of making an estimate i citigroup may have only preliminary incomplete or inaccurate information about the facts underlying the claim ii its assumptions about the future rulings of the court or other tribunal on significant issues or the behavior and incentives of adverse parties or regulators may prove to be wrong and iii the outcomes it is 

 

attempting to predict are often not amenable to the use of statistical or other quantitative analytical tools in addition from time to time an outcome may occur that citigroup had not accounted for in its estimate because it had deemed such an outcome to be remote for all of these reasons the amount of loss in excess of accruals ultimately incurred for the matters as to which an estimate has been made could be substantially higher or lower than the range of loss included in the estimate 

matters as to which an estimate cannot be made  for other matters disclosed below citigroup is not currently able to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss many of these matters remain in very preliminary stages even in some cases where a substantial period of time has passed since the commencement of the matter with few or no substantive legal decisions by the court or tribunal defining the scope of the claims the class if any or the potentially available damages and fact discovery is still in progress or has not yet begun in many of these matters citigroup has not yet answered the complaint or statement of claim or asserted its defenses nor has it engaged in any negotiations with the adverse party whether a regulator or a private party for all these reasons citigroup cannot at this time estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss if any for these matters 

opinion of management as to eventual outcome  subject to the foregoing it is the opinion of citigroup’s management based on current knowledge and after taking into account its current legal accruals that the eventual outcome of all matters described in this note would not be likely to have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition of citigroup nonetheless given the substantial or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and the inherent unpredictability of such matters an adverse outcome in certain of these matters could from time to time have a material adverse effect on citigroup’s consolidated results of operations or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods

21 securitizations and variable interest entities 

  

uses of special purpose entities 

a special purpose entity spe is an entity designed to fulfill a specific limited need of the company that organized it the principal uses of spes by citi are to obtain liquidity and favorable capital treatment by securitizing certain financial assets to assist clients in securitizing their financial assets and to create investment products for clients spes may be organized in various legal forms including trusts partnerships or corporations in a securitization through the spe’s issuance of debt and equity instruments certificates commercial paper or other notes of indebtedness the company transferring assets to the spe converts all or a portion of those assets into cash before they would have been realized in the normal course of business these issuances are recorded on the balance sheet of the spe which may or may not be consolidated onto the balance sheet of the company that organized the spe 

investors usually have recourse only to the assets in the spe but may also benefit from other credit enhancements such as a collateral account a line of credit or a liquidity facility such as a liquidity put option or asset purchase agreement because of these enhancements the spe issuances typically obtain a more favorable credit rating than the transferor could obtain for its own debt issuances this results in less expensive financing costs than unsecured debt the spe may also enter into derivative contracts in order to convert the yield or currency of the underlying assets to match the needs of the spe investors or to limit or change the credit risk of the spe citigroup may be the provider of certain credit enhancements as well as the counterparty to any related derivative contracts 

most of citigroup’s spes are variable interest entities vies as described below 

  

variable interest entities 

vies are entities that have either a total equity investment that is insufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or whose equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest ie ability to make significant decisions through voting rights or similar rights and a right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity or an obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity investors that finance the vie through debt or equity interests or other counterparties providing other forms of support such as guarantees certain fee arrangements or certain types of derivative contracts are variable interest holders in the entity 

 

the variable interest holder if any that has a controlling financial interest in a vie is deemed to be the primary beneficiary and must consolidate the vie citigroup would be deemed to have a controlling financial interest and be the primary beneficiary if it has both of the following characteristics 

 

the company must evaluate each vie to understand the purpose and design of the entity the role the company had in the entity’s design and its involvement in the vie’s ongoing activities the company then must evaluate which activities most significantly impact the economic performance of the vie and who has the power to direct such activities 

for those vies where the company determines that it has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the vie’s economic performance the company must then evaluate its economic interests if any and determine whether it could absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the vie when evaluating whether the company has an obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant it considers the maximum exposure to such loss without consideration of probability such obligations could be in various forms including but not limited to debt and equity investments guarantees liquidity agreements and certain derivative contracts 

in various other transactions the company may i act as a derivative counterparty for example interest rate swap crosscurrency swap or purchaser of credit protection under a credit default swap or total return swap where the company pays the total return on certain assets to the spe ii act as underwriter or placement agent iii provide administrative trustee or other services or iv make a market in debt securities or other instruments issued by vies the company generally considers such involvement by itself not to be variable interests and thus not an indicator of power or potentially significant benefits or losses 

citigroup’s involvement with consolidated and unconsolidated vies with which the company holds significant variable interests or has continuing involvement through servicing a majority of the assets in a vie is presented below 



 

the previous tables do not include the following 

 

 

the asset balances for consolidated vies represent the carrying amounts of the assets consolidated by the company the carrying amount may represent the amortized cost or the current fair value of the assets depending on the legal form of the asset eg loan or security and the company’s standard accounting policies for the asset type and line of business 

the asset balances for unconsolidated vies in which the company has significant involvement represent the most current information available to the company in most cases the asset balances represent an amortized cost basis without regard to impairments unless fair value information is readily available to the company 

the maximum funded exposure represents the balance sheet carrying amount of the company’s investment in the vie it reflects the initial amount of cash invested in the vie adjusted for any accrued interest and cash principal payments received the carrying amount may also be adjusted for increases or declines in fair value or any impairment in value recognized in earnings the maximum exposure of unfunded positions represents the remaining undrawn committed amount including liquidity and credit facilities provided by the company or the notional amount of a derivative instrument considered to be a variable interest in certain transactions the company has entered into derivative instruments or other arrangements that are not considered variable interests in the vie eg interest rate swaps crosscurrency swaps or where the company is the purchaser of credit protection under a credit default swap or total return swap where the company pays the total return on certain assets to the spe receivables under such arrangements are not included in the maximum exposure amounts 

funding commitments for significant unconsolidated vies—liquidity facilities and loan commitments 

the following table presents the notional amount of liquidity facilities and loan commitments that are classified as funding commitments in the vie tables above 



consolidated vies 

the company engages in onbalance sheet securitizations which are securitizations that do not qualify for sales treatment thus the assets remain on the citi’s consolidated balance sheet and any proceeds received are recognized as secured liabilities the consolidated vies represent hundreds of separate entities with which the company is involved in general the thirdparty investors in the obligations of consolidated vies have legal recourse only to the assets of the respective vies and do not have such recourse to the company except where citi has provided a guarantee to the investors or is the counterparty to certain derivative 

 

transactions involving the vie thus citigroup’s maximum legal exposure to loss related to consolidated vies is significantly less than the carrying value of the consolidated vie assets due to outstanding thirdparty financing intercompany assets and liabilities are excluded from citi’s consolidated balance sheet all vie assets are restricted from being sold or pledged as collateral the cash flows from these assets are the only source used to pay down the associated liabilities which are nonrecourse to citi’s general assets see the consolidated balance sheet for more information about these consolidated vie assets and liabilities 

significant interests in unconsolidated vies—balance sheet classification 

the following table presents the carrying amounts and classification of significant variable interests in unconsolidated vies 



credit card securitizations 

the company securitizes credit card receivables through trusts established to purchase the receivables citigroup transfers receivables into the trusts on a nonrecourse basis credit card securitizations are revolving securitizations as customers pay their credit card balances the cash proceeds are used to purchase new receivables and replenish the receivables in the trust 

substantially all of citigroup’s credit card securitization activity is through two  trusts—citibank credit card master trust master trust and citibank omni master trust omni trust with the substantial majority through the master trust these trusts are consolidated entities because as servicer 

 

citigroup has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the trusts citigroup holds a seller’s interest and certain securities issued by the trusts which could result in exposure to potentially significant losses or benefits from the trusts accordingly the transferred credit card receivables remain on citi’s consolidated balance sheet with no  gain or loss recognized the debt issued by the trusts to third parties is included on citi’s consolidated balance sheet 

citi utilizes securitizations as one of the sources of funding for its business in north america  the following table reflects amounts related to the company’s securitized credit card receivables 



the following table summarizes selected cash flow information related to citigroup’s credit card securitizations 



managed loans 

after securitization of credit card receivables the company continues to maintain credit card customer account relationships and provides servicing for receivables transferred to the trusts as a result the company considers the securitized credit card receivables to be part of the business it manages as citigroup consolidates the credit card trusts all managed securitized card receivables are onbalance sheet 

funding liquidity facilities and subordinated interests 

as noted above citigroup securitizes credit card receivables through two  securitization trusts—master trust and omni trust the liabilities of the trusts are included on the consolidated balance sheet excluding those retained by citigroup 

  

 

the master trust issues fixed and floatingrate term notes some of the term notes may be issued to multiseller commercial paper conduits the weighted average maturity of 

the term notes issued by the master trust was 26 years  as of december 31 2017  and 2016  

master trust liabilities at par value 



the omni trust issues fixed and floatingrate term notes some of which are purchased by multiseller commercial paper conduits the weighted average maturity of the thirdparty term notes issued by the omni trust was 19 years  as of december 31 2017  and 2016  

omni trust liabilities at par value 



mortgage securitizations 

citigroup provides a wide range of mortgage loan products to a diverse customer base once originated the company often securitizes these loans through the use of vies these vies are funded through the issuance of trust certificates backed solely by the transferred assets these certificates have the same life as the transferred assets in addition to providing a source of liquidity and less expensive funding securitizing these assets also reduces citi’s credit exposure to the borrowers these mortgage loan securitizations are primarily nonrecourse thereby effectively transferring the risk of future credit losses to the purchasers of the securities issued by the trust however citi’s us consumer mortgage business generally retains the servicing rights and in certain instances retains investment securities interestonly strips and residual interests in future cash flows from the trusts and also provides servicing for a limited number of icg  securitizations 

the company securitizes mortgage loans generally through either a governmentsponsored agency such as ginnie mae fannie mae or freddie mac us agencysponsored mortgages or privatelabel nonagencysponsored mortgages securitization citi is not the primary beneficiary of its us agencysponsored mortgage securitizations because 

 

citigroup does not have the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance therefore citi does not consolidate these us agencysponsored mortgage securitizations substantially all of the consumer loans sold or securitized through nonconsolidated trusts by citigroup are us prime residential mortgage loans retained interests in nonconsolidated mortgage securitization trusts are classified as trading account assets  except for msrs which are included in mortgage servicing rights  on citigroup’s consolidated balance sheet 

citigroup does not consolidate certain nonagencysponsored mortgage securitizations because citi is either not the servicer with the power to direct the significant activities of the entity or citi is the servicer but the servicing relationship is deemed to be a fiduciary relationship therefore citi is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the entity 

in certain instances the company has i the power to direct the activities and ii the obligation to either absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could be potentially significant to its nonagencysponsored mortgage securitizations and therefore is the primary beneficiary and thus consolidates the vie 

the following table summarizes selected cash flow information related to citigroup mortgage securitizations 



1 the proceeds from new securitizations in 2016  and 2015  include 05 billion  and 07 billion  respectively related to personal loan securitizations 

agency and nonagency securitization gains for the year ended december 31 2017  were 73 million  and 77 million  respectively 

 

agency and nonagency securitization gains for the year ended december 31 2016  were 105 million  and 107 million  respectively and 149 million  and 41 million  respectively for the year ended december 31 2015  

key assumptions used in measuring the fair value of retained interests at the date of sale or securitization of mortgage receivables were as follows 





 

the interests retained by citi range from highly rated andor senior in the capital structure to unrated andor residual interests 

the key assumptions used to value retained interests and the sensitivity of the fair value to adverse changes of 10  and 20  in each of the key assumptions are set forth in the tables 

 

below the negative effect of each change is calculated independently holding all other assumptions constant because the key assumptions may not be independent the net effect of simultaneous adverse changes in the key assumptions may be less than the sum of the individual effects shown below 











 

mortgage servicing rights 

in connection with the securitization of mortgage loans citi’s us consumer mortgage business generally retains the servicing rights which entitle the company to a future stream of cash flows based on the outstanding principal balances of the loans and the contractual servicing fee failure to service the loans in accordance with contractual requirements may lead to a termination of the servicing rights and the loss of future servicing fees 

these transactions create an intangible asset referred to as mortgage servicing rights msrs which are recorded at fair value on citi’s consolidated balance sheet the fair value of citi’s capitalized msrs was 558 million  and 16 billion  at december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively the msrs correspond to principal loan balances of 66 billion  and 168 billion  as of december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively the following table summarizes the changes in capitalized msrs 

 





the fair value of the msrs is primarily affected by changes in prepayments of mortgages that result from shifts in mortgage interest rates specifically higher interest rates tend to lead to declining prepayments which causes the fair value of the msrs to increase in managing this risk citigroup economically hedges a significant portion of the value of its msrs through the use of interest rate derivative contracts forward purchase and sale commitments of mortgagebacked securities and purchased securities all classified as trading account assets  the company receives fees during the course of servicing previously securitized mortgages the amounts of these fees were as follows 



in the consolidated statement of income these fees are primarily classified as commissions and fees and changes in msr fair values are classified as other revenue  

citi signed agreements during the first quarter of 2017 to effectively exit its direct us mortgage servicing operations by the end of 2018 to intensify focus on originations the exit of the mortgage servicing operations included the sale of mortgage servicing rights and execution of a subservicing agreement for the remaining citiowned loans and certain other mortgage servicing rights as part of this transaction citi is also transferring certain employees see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the exit of the us mortgage servicing operations and sale of msrs 

resecuritizations 

citigroup engages in resecuritization transactions in which debt securities are transferred to a vie in exchange for new beneficial interests citi did not transfer nonagency privatelabel securities to resecuritization entities during the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  these securities are backed by either residential or commercial mortgages and are often structured on behalf of clients 

as of december 31 2017  the fair value of citiretained interests in privatelabel resecuritization transactions structured by citi totaled approximately 79 million  all related to resecuritization transactions executed prior to 2016  which has been recorded in trading account assets  of this amount substantially all was related to subordinated beneficial interests as of december 31 2016  the fair value of citiretained interests in privatelabel resecuritization transactions structured by citi totaled approximately 126 million  all related to resecuritization transactions executed prior to 2016  of this amount substantially all was related to subordinated beneficial interests the original par value of privatelabel resecuritization transactions in which citi holds a retained interest as of december 31 2017  and 2016  was approximately 887 million  and 13 billion  respectively 

the company also resecuritizes us governmentagency guaranteed mortgagebacked agency securities during the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  citi transferred 

 

agency securities with a fair value of approximately 266 billion  and 265 billion  respectively to resecuritization entities 

as of december 31 2017  the fair value of citiretained interests in agency resecuritization transactions structured by citi totaled approximately 21 billion  including 854 million  related to resecuritization transactions executed in 2017  compared to 23 billion  as of december 31 2016  including 741 million  related to resecuritization transactions executed in 2016  which is recorded in trading account assets  the original fair value of agency resecuritization transactions in which citi holds a retained interest as of december 31 2017  and 2016  was approximately 683 billion  and 718 billion  respectively 

as of december 31 2017  and 2016  the company did not consolidate any privatelabel or agency resecuritization entities 

citiadministered assetbacked commercial paper conduits 

the company is active in the assetbacked commercial paper conduit business as administrator of several multiseller commercial paper conduits and also as a service provider to singleseller and other commercial paper conduits sponsored by third parties 

citi’s multiseller commercial paper conduits are designed to provide the company’s clients access to lowcost funding in the commercial paper markets the conduits purchase assets from or provide financing facilities to clients and are funded by issuing commercial paper to thirdparty investors the conduits generally do not purchase assets originated by citi the funding of the conduits is facilitated by the liquidity support and credit enhancements provided by the company 

as administrator to citi’s conduits the company is generally responsible for selecting and structuring assets purchased or financed by the conduits making decisions regarding the funding of the conduits including determining the tenor and other features of the commercial paper issued monitoring the quality and performance of the conduits’ assets and facilitating the operations and cash flows of the conduits in return the company earns structuring fees from customers for individual transactions and earns an administration fee from the conduit which is equal to the income from the client program and liquidity fees of the conduit after payment of conduit expenses this administration fee is fairly stable since most risks and rewards of the underlying assets are passed back to the clients once the asset pricing is negotiated most ongoing income costs and fees are relatively stable as a percentage of the conduit’s size 

the conduits administered by citi do not generally invest in liquid securities that are formally rated by third parties the assets are privately negotiated and structured transactions that are generally designed to be held by the conduit rather than actively traded and sold the yield earned by the conduit on each asset is generally tied to the rate on the commercial paper issued by the conduit thus passing interest rate risk to the client each asset purchased by the conduit is structured with transactionspecific credit enhancement features provided by the thirdparty client seller including overcollateralization cash and excess spread collateral accounts direct recourse or thirdparty guarantees these credit enhancements are sized 

with the objective of approximating a credit rating of a or above based on citi’s internal risk ratings at december 31 2017  and 2016  the conduits had approximately 193 billion  and 197 billion  of purchased assets outstanding respectively and had incremental funding commitments with clients of approximately 145 billion  and 128 billion  respectively 

substantially all of the funding of the conduits is in the form of shortterm commercial paper at december 31 2017  and 2016  the weighted average remaining lives of the commercial paper issued by the conduits were approximately 51  and 55 days  respectively 

the primary credit enhancement provided to the conduit investors is in the form of transactionspecific credit enhancements described above in addition to the transactionspecific credit enhancements the conduits other than the government guaranteed loan conduit have obtained a letter of credit from the company which is equal to at least 8  to 10  of the conduit’s assets with a minimum of 200 million  the letters of credit provided by the company to the conduits total approximately 17 billion  and 18 billion  as of december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively the net result across multiseller conduits administered by the company is that in the event defaulted assets exceed the transactionspecific credit enhancements described above any losses in each conduit are allocated first to the company and then to the commercial paper investors 

citigroup also provides the conduits with two  forms of liquidity agreements that are used to provide funding to the conduits in the event of a market disruption among other events each asset of the conduits is supported by a transactionspecific liquidity facility in the form of an asset purchase agreement apa under the apa the company has generally agreed to purchase nondefaulted eligible receivables from the conduit at par the apa is not designed to provide credit support to the conduit as it generally does not permit the purchase of defaulted or impaired assets any funding under the apa will likely subject the underlying conduit clients to increased interest costs in addition the company provides the conduits with programwide liquidity in the form of shortterm lending commitments under these commitments the company has agreed to lend to the conduits in the event of a shortterm disruption in the commercial paper market subject to specified conditions the company receives fees for providing both types of liquidity agreements and considers these fees to be on fair market terms 

finally citi is one of several named dealers in the commercial paper issued by the conduits and earns a marketbased fee for providing such services along with thirdparty dealers the company makes a market in the commercial paper and may from time to time fund commercial paper pending sale to a third party on specific dates with less liquidity in the market the company may hold in inventory commercial paper issued by conduits administered by the company as well as conduits administered by third parties separately in the normal course of business citi purchases commercial paper including commercial paper issued by citigroups conduits at december 31 2017  and 2016  the company owned 93 billion  and 97 billion  respectively of the commercial paper issued by its administered conduits the companys purchases 

 

were not driven by market illiquidity and other than the amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules the company is not obligated under any agreement to purchase the commercial paper issued by the conduits 

the assetbacked commercial paper conduits are consolidated by citi the company has determined that through its roles as administrator and liquidity provider it has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities’ economic performance these powers include its ability to structure and approve the assets purchased by the conduits its ongoing surveillance and credit mitigation activities its ability to sell or repurchase assets out of the conduits and its liability management in addition as a result of all the company’s involvement described above it was concluded that citi has an economic interest that could potentially be significant however the assets and liabilities of the conduits are separate and apart from those of citigroup no assets of any conduit are available to satisfy the creditors of citigroup or any of its other subsidiaries 

collateralized loan obligations 

a collateralized loan obligation clo is a vie that purchases a portfolio of assets consisting primarily of noninvestment grade corporate loans clos issue multiple tranches of debt and equity to investors to fund the asset purchases and pay upfront expenses associated with forming the clo a thirdparty asset manager is contracted by the clo to purchase the underlying assets from the open market and monitor the credit risk associated with those assets over the term of a clo the asset manager directs purchases and sales of assets in a manner consistent with the clo’s asset management agreement and indenture in general the clo asset manager will have the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the economic performance of the clo investors in a clo through their ownership of debt andor equity in it can also direct certain activities of the clo including removing its asset manager under limited circumstances optionally redeeming the notes voting on amendments to the clo’s operating documents and other activities a clo has a finite life typically 12 years  

citi serves as a structuring and placement agent with respect to the clos typically the debt and equity of the clos are sold to thirdparty investors on occasion certain citi entities may purchase some portion of a clo’s liabilities for investment purposes in addition citi may purchase typically in the secondary market certain securities issued by the clos to support its market making activities 

the company does not generally have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the clos as this power is generally held by a thirdparty asset manager of the clo as such those clos are not consolidated 

the following table summarizes selected cash flow information related to citigroup clos 



the key assumptions used to value retained interests in clos and the sensitivity of the fair value to adverse changes of 10 and 20 are set forth in the tables below 





assetbased financing 

the company provides loans and other forms of financing to vies that hold assets those loans are subject to the same credit approvals as all other loans originated or purchased by the company financings in the form of debt securities or derivatives are in most circumstances reported in trading account assets  and accounted for at fair value through earnings the company generally does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact these vies’ economic performance thus it does not consolidate them 

the primary types of citi’s assetbased financings total assets of the unconsolidated vies with significant involvement and citi’s maximum exposure to loss are shown below for citi to realize the maximum loss the vie borrower would have to default with no recovery from the assets held by the vie 





 

municipal securities tender option bond tob trusts 

municipal tob trusts may hold fixed or floatingrate taxable or taxexempt securities issued by state and local governments and municipalities tob trusts are typically structured as singleissuer entities whose assets are purchased from either the company or from other investors in the municipal securities market tob trusts finance the purchase of their municipal assets by issuing two  classes of certificates longdated floating rate certificates “floaters” that are putable pursuant to a liquidity facility and residual interest certificates “residuals” the floaters are purchased by thirdparty investors typically taxexempt money market funds the residuals are purchased by the original owner of the municipal securities that are being financed 

from the citigroup’s perspective there are two  types of tob trusts customer and noncustomer customer tob trusts are those trusts utilized by customers of the company to finance their municipal securities investments the residuals issued by these trusts are purchased by the customer being financed noncustomer tob trusts are used by the company to finance its own municipal securities investments the residuals issued by noncustomer tob trusts are purchased by the company 

with respect to both customer and noncustomer tob trusts citi may provide remarketing agent services if floaters are optionally tendered and the company in its role as remarketing agent is unable to find a new investor to purchase the optionally tendered floaters within a specified period of time citigroup may but is not obligated to purchase the tendered floaters into its own inventory the level of the company’s inventory of such floaters fluctuates 

for certain customer tob trusts citi may also serve as a voluntary advance provider in this capacity the company may but is not obligated to make loan advances to customer tob trusts to purchase optionally tendered floaters that have not otherwise been successfully remarketed to new investors such loans are secured by pledged floaters as of december 31 2017  citi had no outstanding voluntary advances to customer tob trusts 

for certain noncustomer trusts the company also provides credit enhancement at december 31 2017  and 2016  approximately 62 million  and 82 million  respectively of the municipal bonds owned by noncustomer tob trusts were subject to a credit guarantee provided by the company 

citigroup also provides liquidity services to many customer and noncustomer trusts if a trust is unwound early due to an event other than a credit event on the underlying municipal bonds the underlying municipal bonds are sold out of the trust and bond sale proceeds are used to redeem the outstanding trust certificates if this results in a shortfall between the bond sale proceeds and the redemption price of the tendered floaters the company pursuant to the liquidity agreement would be obligated to make a payment to the trust to satisfy that shortfall for certain customer tob trusts citigroup has also executed a reimbursement agreement with the holder of the residual pursuant to which the residual holder is obligated to reimburse the company for any payment the company makes under the liquidity arrangement these reimbursement agreements may be subject to daily margining 

based on changes in the market value of the underlying municipal bonds in cases where a third party provides liquidity to a noncustomer tob trust a similar reimbursement arrangement may be executed whereby the company or a consolidated subsidiary of the company as residual holder would absorb any losses incurred by the liquidity provider 

for certain other noncustomer tob trusts citi serves as tender option provider the tender option provider arrangement allows floater holders to put their interests directly to the company at any time subject to the requisite notice period requirements at a price of par 

at december 31 2017  and 2016  liquidity agreements provided with respect to customer tob trusts totaled 32 billion  and 29 billion  respectively of which 20 billion  and 21 billion  respectively were offset by reimbursement agreements for the remaining exposure related to tob transactions where the residual owned by the customer was at least 25  of the bond value at the inception of the transaction no reimbursement agreement was executed 

citi considers both customer and noncustomer tob trusts to be vies customer tob trusts are not consolidated by the company as the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the trust’s economic performance rests with the customer residual holder which may unilaterally cause the sale of the trust’s bonds 

noncustomer tob trusts generally are consolidated because the company holds the residual interest and thus has the unilateral power to cause the sale of the trust’s bonds 

the company also provides other liquidity agreements or letters of credit to customersponsored municipal investment funds which are not variable interest entities and municipalityrelated issuers that totaled 61 billion  and 74 billion  as of december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively these liquidity agreements and letters of credit are offset by reimbursement agreements with various termout provisions 

municipal investments 

municipal investment transactions include debt and equity interests in partnerships that finance the construction and rehabilitation of lowincome housing facilitate lending in new or underserved markets or finance the construction or operation of renewable municipal energy facilities citi generally invests in these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits and grants earned from the investments made by the partnership the company may also provide construction loans or permanent loans for the development or operation of real estate properties held by partnerships these entities are generally considered vies the power to direct the activities of these entities is typically held by the general partner accordingly these entities are not consolidated by citigroup 

 

client intermediation 

client intermediation transactions represent a range of transactions designed to provide investors with specified returns based on the returns of an underlying security referenced asset or index these transactions include creditlinked notes and equitylinked notes in these transactions the vie typically obtains exposure to the underlying security referenced asset or index through a derivative instrument such as a totalreturn swap or a creditdefault swap in turn the vie issues notes to investors that pay a return based on the specified underlying security referenced asset or index the vie invests the proceeds in a financial asset or a guaranteed insurance contract that serves as collateral for the derivative contract over the term of the transaction the company’s involvement in these transactions includes being the counterparty to the vie’s derivative instruments and investing in a portion of the notes issued by the vie in certain transactions the investor’s maximum risk of loss is limited and the company absorbs risk of loss above a specified level citi does not have the power to direct the activities of the vies that most significantly impact their economic performance and thus it does not consolidate them 

citi’s maximum risk of loss in these transactions is defined as the amount invested in notes issued by the vie and the notional amount of any risk of loss absorbed by citi through a separate instrument issued by the vie the derivative instrument held by the company may generate a receivable from the vie for example where the company purchases credit protection from the vie in connection with the vie’s issuance of a creditlinked note which is collateralized by the assets owned by the vie these derivative instruments are not considered variable interests and any associated receivables are not included in the calculation of maximum exposure to the vie 

the proceeds from new securitizations related to citi’s client intermediation transactions for the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  totaled approximately 11 billion  and 23 billion  respectively 

investment funds 

the company is the investment manager for certain investment funds and retirement funds that invest in various asset classes including private equity hedge funds real estate fixed income and infrastructure citigroup earns a management fee which is a percentage of capital under management and may earn performance fees in addition for some of these funds the company has an ownership interest in the investment funds citi has also established a number of investment funds as opportunities for qualified employees to invest in private equity investments the company acts as investment manager for these funds and may provide employees with financing on both recourse and nonrecourse bases for a portion of the employees’ investment commitments 

22 derivatives activities 

in the ordinary course of business citigroup enters into various types of derivative transactions which include   

 

swaps forwards and some option contracts are overthecounter otc derivatives that are bilaterally negotiated with counterparties and settled with those counterparties except for swap contracts that are novated and cleared through central counterparties ccps futures contracts and other option contracts are standardized contracts that are traded on an exchange with a ccp as the counterparty from the inception of the transaction citigroup enters into derivative contracts relating to interest rate foreign currency commodity and other marketcredit risks for the following reasons 



 

denominated debt foreign currencydenominated afs securities and net investment exposures 

derivatives may expose citigroup to market credit or liquidity risks in excess of the amounts recorded on the consolidated balance sheet market risk on a derivative product is the exposure created by potential fluctuations in interest rates market prices foreign exchange rates and other factors and is a function of the type of product the volume of transactions the tenor and terms of the agreement and the underlying volatility credit risk is the exposure to loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to satisfy a derivative liability where the value of any collateral held by citi is not adequate to cover such losses the recognition in earnings of unrealized gains on derivative transactions is subject to management’s assessment of the probability of counterparty default liquidity risk is the potential exposure that arises when the size of a derivative position may affect the ability to monetize the position in a reasonable period of time and at a reasonable cost in periods of high volatility and financial stress 

derivative transactions are customarily documented under industry standard master netting agreements which provide that following an event of default the nondefaulting party may promptly terminate all transactions between the parties and determine the net amount due to be paid to or by the defaulting party events of default include i failure to make a payment on a derivatives transaction that remains uncured following applicable notice and grace periods ii breach of agreement that remains uncured after applicable notice and grace periods iii breach of a representation iv cross default either to thirdparty debt or to other derivative transactions entered into between the parties or in some cases their affiliates v the occurrence of a merger or consolidation which results in a party’s becoming a materially weaker credit and vi the cessation or repudiation of any applicable guarantee or other credit support document obligations under master netting agreements are often secured by collateral posted under an industry standard credit support annex to the master netting agreement an event of default may also occur under a credit support annex if a party fails to make a collateral delivery that remains uncured following applicable notice and grace periods 

the netting and collateral rights incorporated in the master netting agreements are considered to be legally enforceable if a supportive legal opinion has been obtained from counsel of recognized standing that provides i the requisite level of certainty regarding enforceability and ii that the exercise of rights by the nondefaulting party to terminate and closeout transactions on a net basis under these agreements will not be stayed or avoided under applicable law upon an event of default including bankruptcy insolvency or similar proceeding 

a legal opinion may not be sought for certain jurisdictions where local law is silent or unclear as to the enforceability of such rights or where adverse case law or conflicting regulation may cast doubt on the enforceability of such rights in some jurisdictions and for some counterparty types the insolvency law may not provide the requisite level of certainty for 

example this may be the case for certain sovereigns municipalities central banks and us pension plans 

exposure to credit risk on derivatives is affected by market volatility which may impair the ability of counterparties to satisfy their obligations to the company credit limits are established and closely monitored for customers engaged in derivatives transactions citi considers the level of legal certainty regarding enforceability of its offsetting rights under master netting agreements and credit support annexes to be an important factor in its risk management process specifically citi generally transacts much lower volumes of derivatives under master netting agreements where citi does not have the requisite level of legal certainty regarding enforceability because such derivatives consume greater amounts of single counterparty credit limits than those executed under enforceable master netting agreements 

cash collateral and security collateral in the form of g10 government debt securities are often posted by a party to a master netting agreement to secure the net open exposure of the other party the receiving party is free to comminglerehypothecate such collateral in the ordinary course of its business nonstandard collateral such as corporate bonds municipal bonds us agency securities andor mbs may also be pledged as collateral for derivative transactions security collateral posted to open and maintain a master netting agreement with a counterparty in the form of cash andor securities may from time to time be segregated in an account at a thirdparty custodian pursuant to a triparty account control agreement 

information pertaining to citigroup’s derivative activities based on notional amounts is presented in the table below derivative notional amounts are reference amounts from which contractual payments are derived and do not represent a complete and accurate measure of citi’s exposure to derivative transactions rather citi’s derivative exposure arises primarily from market fluctuations ie market risk counterparty failure ie credit risk andor periods of high volatility or financial stress ie liquidity risk as well as any market valuation adjustments that may be required on the 

 

transactions moreover notional amounts do not reflect the netting of offsetting trades for example if citi enters into a receivefixed interest rate swap with 100 million notional and offsets this risk with an identical but opposite payfixed position with a different counterparty 200 million in derivative notionals is reported although these offsetting positions may result in de minimis overall market risk aggregate derivative notional amounts can fluctuate from period to period in the normal course of business based on citi’s market share levels of client activity and other factors 

derivative notionals 





company enters into credit derivative positions for purposes such as risk management yield enhancement reduction of credit concentrations and diversification of overall risk 

the following tables present the gross and net fair values of the company’s derivative transactions and the related offsetting amounts as of december 31 2017  and december 31 2016  gross positive fair values are offset against gross negative fair values by counterparty pursuant to enforceable master netting agreements under asc 8151045 payables and receivables in respect of cash collateral received from or paid to a given counterparty pursuant to a credit support annex are included in the offsetting amount if a legal opinion supporting the enforceability of netting and collateral rights has been obtained gaap does not permit similar offsetting for security collateral 

in addition the table for december 31 2017  reflects rule changes adopted by clearing organizations that require or 

allow entities to elect to treat derivative assets liabilities and the related variation margin as settlement of the related derivative fair values for legal and accounting purposes as opposed to presenting gross derivative assets and liabilities 

 

that are subject to collateral whereby the counterparties would record a related collateral payable or receivable as a result the table for december 31 2017  reflects a reduction of approximately 100 billion  of derivative assets and derivative liabilities that previously would have been reported on a gross basis but are now settled and not subject to collateral the table for december 31 2016  presents derivative assets and liabilities as gross amounts subject to variation margin collateral that were netted under enforceable master netting agreements therefore the net presentation of the affected items on the consolidated balance sheet is consistent for all periods the tables also present amounts that are not permitted to be offset such as security collateral or cash collateral posted at thirdparty custodians but which would be eligible for offsetting to the extent an event of default occurred and a legal opinion supporting enforceability of the netting and collateral rights has been obtained

for the years ended   december 31 2017  2016  and 2015 the amounts recognized in principal transactions  in the consolidated statement of income related to derivatives not designated in a qualifying hedging relationship as well as the underlying nonderivative instruments are presented in note 6  to the consolidated financial statements citigroup presents this disclosure by business classification showing derivative gains and losses related to its trading activities together with gains and losses related to nonderivative instruments within the same trading portfolios as this represents the way these portfolios are risk managed 

the amounts recognized in other revenue  in the consolidated statement of income related to derivatives not designated in a qualifying hedging relationship are shown below the table below does not include any offsetting gainslosses on the economically hedged items to the extent such amounts are also recorded in other revenue  



accounting for derivative hedging 

citigroup accounts for its hedging activities in accordance with asc 815 derivatives and hedging  as a general rule hedge accounting is permitted where the company is exposed to a particular risk such as interest rate or foreign exchange risk that causes changes in the fair value of an asset or liability or variability in the expected future cash flows of an existing asset liability or a forecasted transaction that may affect earnings 

derivative contracts hedging the risks associated with changes in fair value are referred to as fair value hedges while contracts hedging the variability of expected future cash flows are cash flow hedges hedges that utilize derivatives or debt instruments to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with equity investments in nonusdollarfunctionalcurrency foreign subsidiaries net investment in a foreign operation are net investment hedges 

to qualify as an accounting hedge under the hedge accounting rules versus an economic hedge where hedge accounting is not applied a hedging relationship must be highly effective in offsetting the risk designated as being 

 

hedged the hedge relationship must be formally documented at inception detailing the particular risk management objective and strategy for the hedge this includes the item and risks being hedged the hedging instrument being used and how effectiveness will be assessed the effectiveness of these hedging relationships is evaluated at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis both on a retrospective and prospective basis typically using quantitative measures of correlation with hedge ineffectiveness measured and recorded in current earnings hedge effectiveness assessment methodologies are performed in a similar manner for similar hedges and are used consistently throughout the hedging relationships the assessment of effectiveness may exclude changes in the value of the hedged item that are unrelated to the risks being hedged and the changes in fair value of the derivative associated with time value these excluded items are recognized in current earnings for the hedging derivative while changes in the value of a hedged item that are not related to the hedged risk are not recorded 

discontinued hedge accounting 

a hedging instrument must be highly effective in accomplishing the hedge objective of offsetting either changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item for the risk being hedged management may voluntarily dedesignate an accounting hedge at any time but if a hedge relationship is not highly effective it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting and must be dedesignated subsequent changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognized in other revenue  or principal transactions  similar to trading derivatives with no offset recorded related to the hedged item 

for fair value hedges any changes in the fair value of the hedged item remain as part of the basis of the asset or liability and are ultimately realized as an element of the yield on the item for cash flow hedges changes in fair value of the enduser derivative remain in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  aoci and are included in the earnings of future periods when the forecasted hedged cash flows impact earnings however if it becomes probable that some or all of the hedged forecasted transactions will not occur any amounts that remain in aoci   related to these transactions must be immediately reflected in other revenue  

the foregoing criteria are applied on a decentralized basis consistent with the level at which market risk is managed but are subject to various limits and controls the underlying asset liability or forecasted transaction may be an individual item or a portfolio of similar items 

fair value hedges 

hedging of benchmark interest rate risk 

citigroup’s fair value hedges are primarily hedges of fixedrate longterm debt or assets such as availableforsale securities 

citigroup hedges exposure to changes in the fair value of outstanding fixedrate issued debt these hedges are designated as fair value hedges of the benchmark interest rate risk associated with the currency of the hedged liability the fixed cash flows of the hedged items are typically converted to benchmark variablerate cash flows by entering into receivefixed payvariable interest rate swaps by designating an interest rate swap contract as a hedging instrument and electing to apply asc 815 fair value hedge accounting the carrying value of the debt is adjusted to reflect the impact of changes in the benchmark interest rate with such changes in value recorded in other revenue  the related interest rate swap is recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair value also reflected in other revenue  these amounts are expected to and generally do offset any net amount representing hedge ineffectiveness is automatically reflected in current earnings these fair value hedge relationships use either regression or dollaroffset ratio analysis to assess whether the hedging relationships are highly effective at inception and on an ongoing basis 

citigroup also hedges its exposure to changes in the fair value of fixedrate available for sale debt securities due to changes in benchmark interest rates the hedging instruments are typically receivevariable payfixed interest rate swaps these fair value hedging relationships use either regression or dollaroffset ratio analysis to assess whether the hedging relationships are highly effective at inception and on an ongoing basis 

 

hedging of foreign exchange risk 

citigroup hedges the change in fair value attributable to foreign exchange rate movements in availableforsale securities that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity holding the securities which may be within or outside the us the hedging instrument may be a cross currency swap or a forward foreign exchange contract when a forward foreign exchange contract is used as the hedging instrument the portion of the change in the fair value of the hedged availableforsale security attributable to foreign exchange risk ie spot rates is reported in earnings and not aoci which offsets the change in the fair value of the forward contract that is also reflected in earnings citigroup considers the premium associated with forward contracts ie the differential between spot and contractual forward rates as the cost of hedging this amount is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and reflected directly in earnings over the life of the hedge 

hedging of commodity price risk 

citigroup hedges the change in fair value attributable to spot price movements in physical commodities inventory the hedging instrument is a futures contract to sell the underlying commodity in this hedge the change in the value of the hedged inventory is reflected in earnings which offsets the change in the fair value of the futures contract that is also reflected in earnings although the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument recorded in earnings includes changes in forward rates citigroup excludes the differential between the spot and the contractual forward rates under the futures contract from the assessment of hedge effectiveness since the assessment is based on changes in fair value attributable to change in spot prices on both the physical commodity and the futures contract the amount of hedge ineffectiveness is not significant 

the following table summarizes the gains losses on the company’s fair value hedges 





cash flow hedges 

hedging of benchmark interest rate risk 

citigroup hedges the variability of forecasted cash flows associated with floatingrate assetsliabilities and other forecasted transactions variable cash flows from those liabilities are synthetically converted to fixedrate cash flows by entering into receivevariable payfixed interest rate swaps and receivevariable payfixed forwardstarting interest rate swaps variable cash flows associated with certain assets are synthetically converted to fixedrate cash flows by entering into receivefixed payvariable interest rate swaps these cash flow hedging relationships use either regression analysis or dollaroffset ratio analysis to assess whether the hedging relationships are highly effective at inception and on an ongoing basis when the variable interest rates associated with hedged items do not qualify as benchmark interest rates citigroup designates the risk being hedged as the risk of overall variability in the hedged cash flows because efforts are made to match the terms of the derivatives to those of the hedged forecasted cash flows as closely as possible the amount of hedge ineffectiveness is not significant 

for cash flow hedges in which derivatives hedge the variability of forecasted cash flows related to recognized assets liabilities or forecasted transactions the accounting treatment depends on the effectiveness of the hedge to the extent that these derivatives are effective in offsetting the variability of the forecasted hedged cash flows the effective portion of the changes in the derivatives’ fair values will not 

 

be included in current earnings but will be reported in   aoci these changes in fair value will be included in the earnings of future periods when the hedged cash flows impact earnings to the extent that these derivatives are not fully effective changes in their fair values are immediately included in other revenue  citigroup’s cash flow hedges primarily include hedges of floatingrate assets or liabilities which may include loans as well as forecasted transactions 

hedging of foreign exchange risk 

citigroup locks in the functional currency equivalent cash flows of longterm debt and shortterm borrowings that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the issuing entity depending on risk management objectives these types of hedges are designated either as cash flow hedges of foreign exchange risk only or cash flow hedges of both foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk and the hedging instruments are foreign exchange crosscurrency swaps and forward contracts these cash flow hedge relationships use dollaroffset ratio analysis to determine whether the hedging relationships are highly effective at inception and on an ongoing basis 

the amount of hedge ineffectiveness on the cash flow hedges recognized in earnings for the years ended   december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  is not significant the pretax change in aoci from cash flow hedges is presented in the table below 



 for cash flow hedges the changes in the fair value of the hedging derivative remain in aoci on the consolidated balance sheet and will be included in the earnings of future periods to offset the variability of the hedged cash flows when such cash flows affect earnings the net gain associated with cash flow hedges expected to be reclassified from aoci within 12 months of december 31 2017  is approximately 04 billion  the maximum length of time over which forecasted cash flows are hedged is 10  years 

the aftertax impact of cash flow hedges on aoci is shown in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements 

net investment hedges 

consistent with asc 83020 foreign currency matters—foreign currency transactions  asc 815 allows the hedging of the foreign currency risk of a net investment in a foreign operation citigroup uses foreign currency forwards crosscurrency swaps options and foreign currencydenominated debt instruments to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with citigroup’s equity investments in several nonusdollarfunctionalcurrency foreign subsidiaries citigroup records the change in the carrying amount of these investments in the foreign currency translation adjustment  account within aoci simultaneously the effective portion of the hedge of this exposure is also recorded in the foreign currency translation adjustment  account and any ineffective portion is immediately recorded in earnings 

for derivatives designated as net investment hedges citigroup follows the forwardrate method outlined in asc 8153535 according to that method all changes in fair value including changes related to the forwardrate component of the foreign currency forward contracts and the time value of foreign currency options are recorded in the foreign currency translation adjustment  account within aoci 

for foreign currencydenominated debt instruments that are designated as hedges of net investments the translation gain or loss that is recorded in the foreign currency translation adjustment  account is based on the spot exchange rate between the functional currency of the respective subsidiary and the us dollar which is the functional currency of citigroup to the extent the notional amount of the hedging instrument exactly matches the hedged net investment and the underlying exchange rate of the derivative hedging instrument relates to the exchange rate between the functional currency of the net investment and citigroup’s functional currency or in the case of a nonderivative debt instrument such instrument is denominated in the functional currency of the net investment no  ineffectiveness is recorded in earnings 

the pretax gain loss recorded in the foreign currency translation adjustment  account within aoci related to the effective portion of the net investment hedges is 2528 million  220 million  and 2475 million  for the years ended   december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively 

economic hedges 

citigroup often uses economic hedges when hedge accounting would be too complex or operationally burdensome enduser derivatives that are economic hedges are carried at fair value with changes in value included in either principal transactions  or other revenue  

for assetliability management hedging fixedrate longterm debt is recorded at amortized cost under gaap 

for other hedges that either do not meet the asc 815 hedging criteria or for which management decides not to apply asc 815 hedge accounting the derivative is recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with the associated changes in fair value recorded in earnings while the debt continues to be carried at amortized cost therefore current earnings are affected by the interest rate shifts and other factors that cause a change in the swap’s value but for which no offsetting change in value is recorded on the debt 

 

citigroup may alternatively elect to account for the debt at fair value under the fair value option once the irrevocable election is made upon issuance of the debt the full change in fair value of the debt is reported in earnings the changes in fair value of the related interest rate swap are also reflected in earnings which provides a natural offset to the debt’s fair value change to the extent the two amounts differ because the full change in the fair value of the debt includes risks not offset by the interest rate swap the difference is automatically captured in current earnings 

additional economic hedges include hedges of the credit risk component of commercial loans and loan commitments citigroup periodically evaluates its hedging strategies in other areas and may designate either an accounting hedge or an economic hedge after considering the relative costs and benefits economic hedges are also employed when the hedged item itself is marked to market through current earnings such as hedges of commitments to originate one to fourfamily mortgage loans to be held for sale and msrs 

credit derivatives 

citi is a market maker and trades a range of credit derivatives through these contracts citi either purchases or writes protection on either a single name or a portfolio of reference credits citi also uses credit derivatives to help mitigate credit risk in its corporate and consumer loan portfolios and other cash positions and to facilitate client transactions 

citi monitors its counterparty credit risk in credit derivative contracts as of both december 31 2017  and december 31 2016  approximately 98  of the gross receivables are from counterparties with which citi maintains collateral agreements a majority of citi’s top 15  counterparties by receivable balance owed to citi are banks financial institutions or other dealers contracts with these counterparties do not include ratingsbased termination events however counterparty ratings downgrades may have an incremental effect by lowering the threshold at which citi may call for additional collateral 

the range of credit derivatives entered into includes credit default swaps total return swaps credit options and creditlinked notes 

a credit default swap is a contract in which for a fee a protection seller agrees to reimburse a protection buyer for any losses that occur due to a predefined credit event on a reference entity these credit events are defined by the terms of the derivative contract and the reference credit and are generally limited to the market standard of failure to pay on indebtedness and bankruptcy of the reference credit and in a more limited range of transactions debt restructuring credit derivative transactions that reference emerging market entities also typically include additional credit events to cover the acceleration of indebtedness and the risk of repudiation or a payment moratorium in certain transactions protection may be provided on a portfolio of reference entities or assetbacked securities if there is no credit event as defined by the specific derivative contract then the protection seller makes no payments to the protection buyer and receives only the contractually specified fee however if a credit event occurs as defined in the specific derivative contract sold the 

protection seller will be required to make a payment to the protection buyer under certain contracts the seller of protection may not be required to make a payment until a specified amount of losses has occurred with respect to the portfolio andor may only be required to pay for losses up to a specified amount 

a total return swap typically transfers the total economic performance of a reference asset which includes all associated cash flows as well as capital appreciation or depreciation the protection buyer receives a floating rate of interest and any depreciation on the reference asset from the protection seller and in return the protection seller receives the cash flows associated with the reference asset plus any appreciation thus according to the total return swap agreement the protection seller will be obligated to make a payment any time the floating interest rate payment plus any depreciation of the reference asset exceeds the cash flows associated with the underlying asset a total return swap may terminate upon a default of the reference asset or a credit event with respect to the reference entity subject to the provisions of the related total return swap agreement between the protection seller and the protection buyer 

a credit option is a credit derivative that allows investors to trade or hedge changes in the credit quality of a reference entity for example in a credit spread option the option writer assumes the obligation to purchase or sell credit protection on the reference entity at a specified “strike” spread level the option purchaser buys the right to sell credit default protection on the reference entity to or purchase it from the option writer at the strike spread level the payments on credit spread options depend either on a particular credit spread or the price of the underlying creditsensitive asset or other reference entity the options usually terminate if a credit event occurs with respect to the underlying reference entity 

a creditlinked note is a form of credit derivative structured as a debt security with an embedded credit default swap the purchaser of the note effectively provides credit protection to the issuer by agreeing to receive a return that could be negatively affected by credit events on the underlying reference credit if the reference entity defaults the note may be cash settled or physically settled by delivery of a debt security of the reference entity thus the maximum amount of the note purchaser’s exposure is the amount paid for the creditlinked note 

the following tables summarize the key characteristics of citi’s credit derivatives portfolio by counterparty and derivative form 



 





fair values included in the above tables are prior to application of any netting agreements and cash collateral for notional amounts citi generally has a mismatch between the total notional amounts of protection purchased and sold and it may hold the reference assets directly rather than entering into offsetting credit derivative contracts as and when desired the open risk exposures from credit derivative contracts are largely matched after certain cash positions in reference assets are considered and after notional amounts are adjusted either to a durationbased equivalent basis or to reflect the level of subordination in tranched structures the ratings of the credit derivatives portfolio presented in the tables and used to evaluate paymentperformance risk are based on the assigned internal or external ratings of the reference asset or entity where external ratings are used investmentgrade ratings are considered to be ‘baabbb’ and above while anything below is considered noninvestment grade citi’s internal ratings are in line with the related external rating system 

citigroup evaluates the paymentperformance risk of the credit derivatives for which it stands as a protection seller based on the credit rating assigned to the underlying reference credit credit derivatives written on an underlying noninvestment grade reference credit represent greater payment risk to the company the noninvestment grade category in the table above also includes credit derivatives where the underlying reference entity has been downgraded subsequent to the inception of the derivative 

the maximum potential amount of future payments under credit derivative contracts presented in the table above is based on the notional value of the derivatives the company believes that the notional amount for credit protection sold is not representative of the actual loss exposure based on historical experience this amount has not been reduced by the value of the reference assets and the related cash flows in accordance with most credit derivative contracts should a credit event occur the company usually is liable for the difference between the protection sold and the value of the reference assets furthermore the notional amount for credit protection sold has not been reduced for any cash collateral paid to a given counterparty as such payments would be calculated after netting all derivative exposures including any credit derivatives with that counterparty in accordance with a related master netting agreement due to such netting processes determining the amount of collateral that corresponds to credit derivative exposures alone is not possible the company actively monitors open creditrisk exposures and manages this exposure by using a variety of strategies including purchased credit derivatives cash collateral or direct holdings of the referenced assets this risk mitigation activity is not captured in the table above 

 

credit riskrelated contingent features in derivatives 

certain derivative instruments contain provisions that require the company to either post additional collateral or immediately settle any outstanding liability balances upon the occurrence of a specified event related to the credit risk of the company these events which are defined by the existing derivative contracts are primarily downgrades in the credit ratings of the company and its affiliates the fair value excluding cva of all derivative instruments with creditriskrelated contingent features that were in a net liability position at both december 31 2017  and december 31 2016  was 29 billion  and 26 billion  respectively the company posted 28 billion  and 26 billion  as collateral for this exposure in the normal course of business as of december 31 2017  and december 31 2016  respectively 

a downgrade could trigger additional collateral or cash settlement requirements for the company and certain affiliates in the event that citigroup and citibank were downgraded a single notch by all three  major rating agencies as of december 31 2017  the company could be required to post an additional 09 billion  as either collateral or settlement of the derivative transactions additionally the company could be required to segregate with thirdparty custodians collateral previously received from existing derivative counterparties in the amount of 03 billion  upon the single notch downgrade resulting in aggregate cash obligations and collateral requirements of approximately 12 billion  

derivatives accompanied by financial asset transfers 

the company executes total return swaps that provide it with synthetic exposure to substantially all of the economic return of the securities or other financial assets referenced in the contract in certain cases the derivative transaction is accompanied by the company’s transfer of the referenced financial asset to the derivative counterparty most typically in response to the derivative counterparty’s desire to hedge in whole or in part its synthetic exposure under the derivative contract by holding the referenced asset in funded form in certain jurisdictions these transactions qualify as sales resulting in derecognition of the securities transferred see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the related sale conditions for transfers of financial assets for a significant portion of the transactions the company has also executed another total return swap where the company passes on substantially all of the economic return of the referenced securities to a different third party seeking the exposure in those cases the company is not exposed on a net basis to changes in the economic return of the referenced securities 

these transactions generally involve the transfer of the company’s liquid government bonds convertible bonds or publicly traded corporate equity securities from the trading portfolio and are executed with thirdparty financial institutions the accompanying derivatives are typically total return swaps the derivatives are cash settled and subject to ongoing margin requirements 

when the conditions for sale accounting are met the company reports the transfer of the referenced financial asset as a sale and separately reports the accompanying derivative 

transaction these transactions generally do not result in a gain or loss on the sale of the security because the transferred security was held at fair value in the company’s trading portfolio for transfers of financial assets accounted for by the company as a sale where the company has retained substantially all of the economic exposure to the transferred asset through a total return swap executed in contemplation of the initial sale with the same counterparty and still outstanding as of december 31 2017  and december 31 2016 both the asset carrying amounts derecognized and gross cash proceeds received as of the date of derecognition were 30 billion  and 10 billion  respectively at december 31 2017  the fair value of these previously derecognized assets was 31 billion  and the fair value of the total return swaps was 89 million  recorded as gross derivative assets and 15 million  recorded as gross derivative liabilities at december 31 2016 the fair value of these previously derecognized assets was 10 billion  and the fair value of the total return swaps was 32 million  recorded as gross derivative assets and 23 million  recorded as gross derivative liabilities the balances for the total return swaps are on a gross basis before the application of counterparty and cash collateral netting and are included primarily as equity derivatives in the tabular disclosures in this note 

23 concentrations of credit risk 

concentrations of credit risk exist when changes in economic industry or geographic factors similarly affect groups of counterparties whose aggregate credit exposure is material in relation to citigroup’s total credit exposure although citigroup’s portfolio of financial instruments is broadly diversified along industry product and geographic lines material transactions are completed with other financial institutions particularly in the securities trading derivatives and foreign exchange businesses 

in connection with the company’s efforts to maintain a diversified portfolio the company limits its exposure to any one geographic region country or individual creditor and monitors this exposure on a continuous basis at december 31 2017  citigroup’s most significant concentration of credit risk was with the us government and its agencies the company’s exposure which primarily results from trading assets and investments issued by the us government and its agencies amounted to 2278 billion  and 2285 billion  at december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively the german and japanese governments and their agencies which are rated investment grade by both moody’s and sp were the next largest exposures the company’s exposure to germany amounted to 383 billion  and 267 billion  at december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively and was composed of investment securities loans and trading assets the company’s exposure to japan amounted to 258 billion  and 273 billion  at december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively and was composed of investment securities loans and trading assets 

the company’s exposure to states and municipalities amounted to 306 billion  and 307 billion  at december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively and was composed of trading assets investment securities derivatives and lending activities 

24 fair value measurement 

asc 82010 fair value measurement  defines fair value establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value and requires disclosures about fair value measurements fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date among other things the standard requires the company to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value 

under asc 82010 the probability of default of a counterparty is factored into the valuation of derivative and other positions as well as the impact of citigroup’s own credit risk on derivatives and other liabilities measured at fair value 

fair value hierarchy 

asc 82010 specifies a hierarchy of inputs based on whether the inputs are observable or unobservable observable inputs are developed using market data and reflect market participant assumptions while unobservable inputs reflect the company’s market assumptions these two types of inputs have created the following fair value hierarchy 

 

as required under the fair value hierarchy the company considers relevant and observable market inputs in its valuations where possible the frequency of transactions the size of the bidask spread and the amount of adjustment necessary when comparing similar transactions are all factors in determining the liquidity of markets and the relevance of observed prices in those markets 

the company’s policy with respect to transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy is to recognize transfers into and out of each level as of the end of the reporting period 

determination of fair value 

for assets and liabilities carried at fair value the company measures fair value using the procedures set out below irrespective of whether the assets and liabilities are measured at fair value as a result of an election or whether they are required to be measured at fair value 

when available the company uses quoted market prices to determine fair value and classifies such items as level 1 in some cases where a market price is available the 

 

company will make use of acceptable practical expedients such as matrix pricing to calculate fair value in which case the items are classified as level 2 

the company may also apply a pricebased methodology which utilizes where available quoted prices or other market information obtained from recent trading activity in positions with the same or similar characteristics to the position being valued the market activity and the amount of the bidask spread are among the factors considered in determining the liquidity of markets and the observability of prices from those markets if relevant and observable prices are available those valuations may be classified as level 2 when less liquidity exists for a security or loan a quoted price is stale a significant adjustment to the price of a similar security is necessary to reflect differences in the terms of the actual security or loan being valued or prices from independent sources are insufficient to corroborate the valuation the “price” inputs are considered unobservable and the fair value measurements are classified as level 3 

if quoted market prices are not available fair value is based upon internally developed valuation techniques that use where possible current marketbased parameters such as interest rates currency rates and option volatilities items valued using such internally generated valuation techniques are classified according to the lowest level input or value driver that is significant to the valuation thus an item may be classified as level 3 even though there may be some significant inputs that are readily observable 

fair value estimates from internal valuation techniques are verified where possible to prices obtained from independent vendors or brokers vendors’ and brokers’ valuations may be based on a variety of inputs ranging from observed prices to proprietary valuation models 

the following section describes the valuation methodologies used by the company to measure various financial instruments at fair value including an indication of the level in the fair value hierarchy in which each instrument is generally classified where appropriate the description includes details of the valuation models the key inputs to those models and any significant assumptions 

market valuation adjustments 

generally the unit of account for a financial instrument is the individual financial instrument the company applies market valuation adjustments that are consistent with the unit of account which does not include adjustment due to the size of the company’s position except as follows asc 82010 permits an exception through an accounting policy election to measure the fair value of a portfolio of financial assets and financial liabilities on the basis of the net open risk position when certain criteria are met citi has elected to measure certain portfolios of financial instruments such as derivatives that meet those criteria on the basis of the net open risk position the company applies market valuation adjustments including adjustments to account for the size of the net open risk position consistent with market participant assumptions and in accordance with the unit of account 

liquidity adjustments are applied to items in level 2 or level 3 of the fair value hierarchy in an effort to ensure that the fair value reflects the price at which the net open risk position could be liquidated the liquidity adjustment is based on the bidoffer spread for an instrument when citi has elected to measure certain portfolios of financial investments such as derivatives on the basis of the net open risk position the liquidity adjustment may be adjusted to take into account the size of the position 

credit valuation adjustments cva and funding valuation adjustments fva are applied to overthecounter otc derivative instruments in which the base valuation generally discounts expected cash flows using the relevant base interest rate curve for the currency of the derivative eg libor for uncollateralized usdollar derivatives as not all counterparties have the same credit risk as that implied by the relevant base curve a cva is necessary to incorporate the market view of both counterparty credit risk and citi’s own credit risk in the valuation fva reflects a market funding risk premium inherent in the uncollateralized portion of derivative portfolios and in collateralized derivatives where the terms of the agreement do not permit the reuse of the collateral received 

citi’s cva and fva methodology consists of two steps 

 the cva and fva are designed to incorporate a market view of the credit and funding risk respectively inherent in 

 

the derivative portfolio however most unsecured derivative instruments are negotiated bilateral contracts and are not commonly transferred to third parties derivative instruments are normally settled contractually or if terminated early are terminated at a value negotiated bilaterally between the counterparties thus the cva and fva may not be realized upon a settlement or termination in the normal course of business in addition all or a portion of these adjustments may be reversed or otherwise adjusted in future periods in the event of changes in the credit or funding risk associated with the derivative instruments 

the table below summarizes the cva and fva applied to the fair value of derivative instruments at december 31 2017 and 2016

valuation process for fair value measurements 

price verification procedures and related internal control procedures are governed by the citigroup pricing and price verification policy and standards  which is jointly owned by finance and risk management 

for fair value measurements of substantially all assets and liabilities held by the company individual business units are responsible for valuing the trading account assets and liabilities and product control within finance performs independent price verification procedures to evaluate those fair value measurements product control is independent of the individual business units and reports to the global head of product control it has authority over the valuation of financial assets and liabilities fair value measurements of assets and liabilities are determined using various techniques including but not limited to discounted cash flows and internal models such as option and correlation models 

based on the observability of inputs used product control classifies the inventory as level 1 level 2 or level 3 of the fair value hierarchy when a position involves one or more significant inputs that are not directly observable price verification procedures are performed that may include reviewing relevant historical data analyzing profit and loss valuing each component of a structured trade individually and benchmarking among others 

reports of inventory that is classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are distributed to senior management in finance risk and the business this inventory is also discussed in risk committees and in monthly meetings with senior trading management as deemed necessary reports may go to the audit committee of the board of directors or to the full board of directors whenever an adjustment is needed to bring the price of an asset or liability to its exit price product control reports it to management along with other price verification results 

in addition the pricing models used in measuring fair value are governed by an independent control framework although the models are developed and tested by the individual business units they are independently validated by the model validation group within risk management and reviewed by finance with respect to their impact on the price verification procedures the purpose of this independent control framework is to assess model risk arising from models’ theoretical soundness calibration techniques where needed and the appropriateness of the model for a specific product in a defined market to ensure their continued applicability models are independently reviewed annually in addition risk management approves and maintains a list of products permitted to be valued under each approved model for a given business 

 

securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under agreements to repurchase 

no quoted prices exist for these instruments so fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow technique cash flows are estimated based on the terms of the contract taking into account any embedded derivative or other features these cash flows are discounted using interest rates appropriate to the maturity of the instrument as well as the nature of the underlying collateral generally when such instruments are recorded at fair value they are classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as the inputs used in the valuation are readily observable however certain longdated positions are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy 

trading account assets and liabilities—trading securities and trading loans 

when available the company uses quoted market prices in active markets to determine the fair value of trading securities such items are classified as level 1 of the fair value hierarchy examples include government securities and exchangetraded equity securities 

for bonds and secondary market loans traded over the counter the company generally determines fair value utilizing valuation techniques including discounted cash flows pricebased and internal models such as blackscholes and monte carlo simulation fair value estimates from these internal valuation techniques are verified where possible to prices obtained from independent sources including thirdparty vendors vendors compile prices from various sources and may apply matrix pricing for similar bonds or loans where no price is observable a pricebased methodology utilizes where available quoted prices or other market information obtained from recent trading activity of assets with similar characteristics to the bond or loan being valued the yields used in discounted cash flow models are derived from the same price information trading securities and loans priced using such methods are generally classified as level 2 however when less liquidity exists for a security or loan a quoted price is stale a significant adjustment to the price of a similar security or loan is necessary to reflect differences in the terms of the actual security or loan being valued or prices from independent sources are insufficient to corroborate valuation a loan or security is generally classified as level 3 the price input used in a pricebased methodology may be zero for a security such as a subprime cdo that is not receiving any principal or interest and is currently written down to zero 

when the company’s principal market for a portfolio of loans is the securitization market the company uses the securitization price to determine the fair value of the portfolio the securitization price is determined from the assumed proceeds of a hypothetical securitization in the current market adjusted for transformation costs ie direct costs other than transaction costs and securitization uncertainties such as market conditions and liquidity as a result of the severe reduction in the level of activity in certain securitization markets since the second half of 2007 observable securitization prices for certain directly 

comparable portfolios of loans have not been readily available therefore such portfolios of loans are generally classified as level 3 of the fair value hierarchy however for other loan securitization markets such as commercial real estate loans price verification of the hypothetical securitizations has been possible since these markets have remained active accordingly this loan portfolio is classified as level 2 of the fair value hierarchy 

for most of the lending and structured direct subprime exposures fair value is determined utilizing observable transactions where available other market data for similar assets in markets that are not active and other internal valuation techniques the valuation of certain assetbacked security abs cdo positions utilizes prices based on the underlying assets of the abs cdo 

trading account assets and liabilities—derivatives 

exchangetraded derivatives measured at fair value using quoted ie exchange prices in active markets where available are classified as level 1 of the fair value hierarchy 

derivatives without a quoted price in an active market and derivatives executed over the counter are valued using internal valuation techniques these derivative instruments are classified as either level 2 or level 3 depending upon the observability of the significant inputs to the model 

the valuation techniques and inputs depend on the type of derivative and the nature of the underlying instrument the principal techniques used to value these instruments are discounted cash flows and internal models including blackscholes and monte carlo simulation 

the key inputs depend upon the type of derivative and the nature of the underlying instrument and include interest rate yield curves foreign exchange rates volatilities and correlation the company uses overnight indexed swap ois curves as fair value measurement inputs for the valuation of certain collateralized derivatives citi uses the relevant benchmark curve for the currency of the derivative eg the london interbank offered rate for usdollar derivatives as the discount rate for uncollateralized derivatives 

as referenced above during the third  quarter of 2016  citi incorporated fva into the fair value measurements due to what it believes to be an industry migration toward incorporating the market’s view of funding risk premium in otc derivatives the charge incurred in connection with the implementation of fva was reflected in principal transactions  as a change in accounting estimate citi’s fva methodology leverages the existing cva methodology to estimate a funding exposure profile the calculation of this exposure profile considers collateral agreements where the terms do not permit the company to reuse the collateral received including where counterparties post collateral to thirdparty custodians 

 

investments 

the investments category includes availableforsale debt and marketable equity securities whose fair values are generally determined by utilizing similar procedures described for trading securities above or in some cases using vendor pricing as the primary source 

also included in investments are nonpublic investments in private equity and real estate entities determining the fair value of nonpublic securities involves a significant degree of management judgment as no quoted prices exist and such securities are generally thinly traded in addition there may be transfer restrictions on private equity securities the company’s process for determining the fair value of such securities utilizes commonly accepted valuation techniques including comparables analysis in determining the fair value of nonpublic securities the company also considers events such as a proposed sale of the investee company initial public offerings equity issuances or other observable transactions 

private equity securities are generally classified as level 3 of the fair value hierarchy 

in addition the company holds investments in certain alternative investment funds that calculate nav per share including hedge funds private equity funds and real estate funds investments in funds are generally classified as nonmarketable equity securities carried at fair value the fair values of these investments are estimated using the nav per share of the company’s ownership interest in the funds where it is not probable that the investment will be realized at a price other than the nav consistent with the provisions of asu 201507 these investments have not been categorized within the fair value hierarchy and are not included in the tables below see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

shortterm borrowings and longterm debt 

where fair value accounting has been elected the fair value of nonstructured liabilities is determined by utilizing internal models using the appropriate discount rate for the applicable maturity such instruments are generally classified as level 2 of the fair value hierarchy when all significant inputs are readily observable 

the company determines the fair value of hybrid financial instruments including structured liabilities using the appropriate derivative valuation methodology described above in “trading account assets and liabilities—derivatives” given the nature of the embedded risk profile such instruments are classified as level 2 or level 3 depending on the observability of significant inputs to the model 

items measured at fair value on a recurring basis 

the following tables present for each of the fair value hierarchy levels the company’s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis at december 31 2017  and december 31 2016  the company may hedge positions that have been classified in the level 3 category with 

 

other financial instruments hedging instruments that may be classified as level 3 but also with financial instruments classified as level 1 or level 2 of the fair value hierarchy the effects of these hedges are presented gross in the following tables

the following tables present the changes in the level 3 fair value category for the years ended   december 31 2017  and 2016  the gains and losses presented below include changes in the fair value related to both observable and unobservable inputs 

the company often hedges positions with offsetting positions that are classified in a different level for example the gains and losses for assets and liabilities in the level 3 

 

category presented in the tables below do not reflect the effect of offsetting losses and gains on hedging instruments that may be classified in the level 1 and level 2 categories in addition the company hedges items classified in the level 3 category with instruments also classified in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy the hedged items and related hedges are presented gross in the following tables

valuation techniques and inputs for level 3 fair value measurements 

the company’s level 3 inventory consists of both cash 

instruments and derivatives of varying complexity the 

valuation methodologies used to measure the fair value of 

these positions include discounted cash flow analysis internal 

models and comparative analysis a position is classified 

within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy when at least one 

input is unobservable and is considered significant to its 

valuation the specific reason an input is deemed 

unobservable varies for example at least one significant 

input to the pricing model is not observable in the market at 

 

least one significant input has been adjusted to make it more 

representative of the position being valued or the price quote 

available does not reflect sufficient trading activities 

the following tables present the valuation techniques covering the majority of level 3 inventory and the most significant unobservable inputs used in level 3 fair value measurements differences between this table and amounts presented in the level 3 fair value rollforward table represent individually immaterial items that have been measured using a variety of valuation techniques other than those listed 

valuation techniques and inputs for level 3 fair value measurements 









sensitivity to unobservable inputs and interrelationships between unobservable inputs 

the impact of key unobservable inputs on the level 3 fair value measurements may not be independent of one another in addition the amount and direction of the impact on a fair value measurement for a given change in an unobservable input depends on the nature of the instrument as well as whether the company holds the instrument as an asset or a liability for certain instruments the pricing hedging and risk management are sensitive to the correlation between various inputs rather than on the analysis and aggregation of the individual inputs 

the following section describes the sensitivities and interrelationships of the most significant unobservable inputs used by the company in level 3 fair value measurements 

correlation 

correlation is a measure of the extent to which two or more variables change in relation to each other a variety of correlationrelated assumptions are required for a wide range of instruments including equity and credit baskets foreignexchange options cdos backed by loans or bonds mortgages subprime mortgages and many other instruments for almost all of these instruments correlations are not observable in the market and must be calculated using historical information estimating correlation can be especially difficult where it may vary over time calculating correlation information from market data requires significant assumptions regarding the informational efficiency of the market for example swaption markets changes in correlation levels can have a major impact favorable or unfavorable on the value of an instrument depending on its nature a change in the default correlation of the fair value of the underlying bonds comprising a cdo structure would affect the fair value of the senior tranche for example an increase in the default correlation of the underlying bonds would reduce the fair value of the senior tranche because highly correlated instruments produce larger losses in the event of default and a part of these losses would become attributable to the senior tranche that same change in default correlation would have a different impact on junior tranches of the same structure 

volatility 

volatility represents the speed and severity of market price changes and is a key factor in pricing options typically instruments can become more expensive if volatility increases for example as an index becomes more volatile the cost to citi of maintaining a given level of exposure increases because more frequent rebalancing of the portfolio is required volatility generally depends on the tenor of the underlying instrument and the strike price or level defined in the contract volatilities for certain combinations of tenor and strike are not observable the general relationship between changes in the value of a portfolio to changes in volatility also depends on changes in interest rates and the level of the underlying index generally long option positions assets benefit from increases in volatility whereas short option positions liabilities will suffer losses some instruments are more sensitive to changes in volatility than others for example an 

 

atthemoney option would experience a larger percentage change in its fair value than a deepinthemoney option in addition the fair value of an option with more than one underlying security for example an option on a basket of bonds depends on the volatility of the individual underlying securities as well as their correlations 

yield 

in some circumstances the yield of an instrument is not observable in the market and must be estimated from historical data or from yields of similar securities this estimated yield may need to be adjusted to capture the characteristics of the security being valued in other situations the estimated yield may not represent sufficient market liquidity and must be adjusted as well whenever the amount of the adjustment is significant to the value of the security the fair value measurement is classified as level 3 

adjusted yield is generally used to discount the projected future principal and interest cash flows on instruments such as assetbacked securities adjusted yield is impacted by changes in the interest rate environment and relevant credit spreads 

prepayment 

voluntary unscheduled payments prepayments change the future cash flows for the investor and thereby change the fair value of the security the effect of prepayments is more pronounced for residential mortgagebacked securities an increase in prepayments—in speed or magnitude—generally creates losses for the holder of these securities prepayment is generally negatively correlated with delinquency and interest rate a combination of low prepayment and high delinquencies amplifies each input’s negative impact on mortgage securities’ valuation as prepayment speeds change the weighted average life of the security changes which impacts the valuation either positively or negatively depending upon the nature of the security and the direction of the change in the weighted average life 

recovery 

recovery is the proportion of the total outstanding balance of a bond or loan that is expected to be collected in a liquidation scenario for many credit securities such as assetbacked securities there is no directly observable market input for recovery but indications of recovery levels are available from pricing services the assumed recovery of a security may differ from its actual recovery that will be observable in the future the recovery rate impacts the valuation of credit securities generally an increase in the recovery rate assumption increases the fair value of the security an increase in loss severity the inverse of the recovery rate reduces the amount of principal available for distribution and as a result decreases the fair value of the security 

credit spread 

credit spread is a component of the security representing its credit quality credit spread reflects the market perception of changes in prepayment delinquency and recovery rates 

therefore capturing the impact of other variables on the fair value changes in credit spread affect the fair value of 

securities differently depending on the characteristics and maturity profile of the security for example credit spread is a more significant driver of the fair value measurement of a high yield bond as compared to an investment grade bond generally the credit spread for an investment grade bond is also more observable and less volatile than its high yield counterpart 

qualitative discussion of the ranges of significant unobservable inputs 

the following section describes the ranges of the most significant unobservable inputs used by the company in level 3 fair value measurements the level of aggregation and the diversity of instruments held by the company lead to a wide range of unobservable inputs that may not be evenly distributed across the level 3 inventory 

correlation 

there are many different types of correlation inputs including credit correlation crossasset correlation such as equityinterest rate correlation and sameasset correlation such as interest rateinterest rate correlation correlation inputs are generally used to value hybrid and exotic instruments generally sameasset correlation inputs have a narrower range than crossasset correlation inputs however due to the complex and unique nature of these instruments the ranges for correlation inputs can vary widely across portfolios 

volatility 

similar to correlation assetspecific volatility inputs vary widely by asset type for example ranges for foreign exchange volatility are generally lower and narrower than equity volatility equity volatilities are wider due to the nature of the equities market and the terms of certain exotic instruments for most instruments the interest rate volatility input is on the lower end of the range however for certain structured or exotic instruments such as marketlinked deposits or exotic interest rate derivatives the range is much wider 

yield 

ranges for the yield inputs vary significantly depending upon the type of security for example securities that typically have lower yields such as municipal bonds will fall in the lower end of the range while more illiquid securities or securities with lower credit quality such as certain residual tranche assetbacked securities will have much higher yield inputs 

credit spread 

credit spread is relevant primarily for fixed income and credit instruments however the ranges for the credit spread input can vary across instruments for example certain fixed income instruments such as certificates of deposit typically have lower credit spreads whereas certain derivative instruments with highrisk counterparties are typically subject to higher credit spreads when they are uncollateralized or have a longer tenor other instruments such as credit default swaps 

 

also have credit spreads that vary with the attributes of the underlying obligor stronger companies have tighter credit spreads and weaker companies have wider credit spreads

the price input is a significant unobservable input for certain fixed income instruments for these instruments the price input is expressed as a percentage of the notional amount with a price of 100  meaning that the instrument is valued at par for most of these instruments the price varies between zero  to 100  or slightly above 100  relatively illiquid assets that have experienced significant losses since issuance such as certain assetbacked securities are at the lower end of the range whereas most investment grade corporate bonds will fall in the middle to the higher end of the range for certain structured debt instruments with embedded derivatives the price input may be above 100  to reflect the embedded features of the instrument for example a stepup coupon or a conversion option 

the price input is also a significant unobservable input for certain equity securities however the range of price inputs varies depending on the nature of the position the number of shares outstanding and other factors 

mean reversion 

a number of financial instruments require an estimate of the rate at which the interest rate reverts to its longterm average changes in this estimate can significantly affect the fair value of these instruments however sometimes there is insufficient external market data to calibrate this parameter especially when pricing more complex instruments the level of mean reversion affects the correlation between short and longterm interest rates the fair values of more complex instruments such as bermudan swaptions options with multiple exercise dates and constant maturity spread options or structured debts with these embedded features are more sensitive to the changes in this correlation as compared to less complex instruments such as caps and floors 

items measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis 

certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and therefore are not included in the tables above these include assets measured at cost that have been written down to fair value during the periods as a result of an impairment in addition these assets include loans heldforsale and other real estate owned that are measured at the lower of cost or market 

the following table presents the carrying amounts of all assets that were still held for which a nonrecurring fair value measurement was recorded 





 

the fair value of loans heldforsale is determined where possible using quoted secondarymarket prices if no such quoted price exists the fair value of a loan is determined using quoted prices for a similar asset or assets adjusted for the specific attributes of that loan fair value for the other real estate owned is based on appraisals for loans whose carrying amount is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral the fair values depend on the type of collateral fair value of the collateral is typically estimated based on quoted market prices if available appraisals or other internal valuation techniques 

where the fair value of the related collateral is based on an unadjusted appraised value the loan is generally classified as level 2 where significant adjustments are made to the appraised value the loan is classified as level 3 additionally for corporate loans appraisals of the collateral are often based on sales of similar assets however because the prices of similar assets require significant adjustments to reflect the unique features of the underlying collateral these fair value measurements are generally classified as level 3 

valuation techniques and inputs for level 3 nonrecurring fair value measurements 

the following tables present the valuation techniques covering the majority of level 3 nonrecurring fair value measurements and the most significant unobservable inputs used in those measurements 





 

nonrecurring fair value changes 

the following table presents total nonrecurring fair value measurements for the period included in earnings attributable to the change in fair value relating to assets that were still held 







estimated fair value of financial instruments not carried at fair value 

the following table presents the carrying value and fair value of citigroup’s financial instruments that are not carried at fair value the table below therefore excludes items measured at fair value on a recurring basis presented in the tables above 

the disclosure also excludes leases affiliate investments pension and benefit obligations certain insurance contracts and taxrelated items also as required the disclosure excludes the effect of taxes any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the entire holdings of a particular instrument excess fair value associated with deposits with no fixed maturity and other expenses that would be incurred in a market transaction in addition the table excludes the values of nonfinancial assets and liabilities as well as a wide range of franchise relationship and intangible values which are integral to a full assessment of citigroup’s financial position and the value of its net assets 

the fair value represents management’s best estimates based on a range of methodologies and assumptions the 

 

carrying value of shortterm financial instruments not accounted for at fair value as well as receivables and payables arising in the ordinary course of business approximates fair value because of the relatively short period of time between their origination and expected realization quoted market prices are used when available for investments and for liabilities such as longterm debt not carried at fair value for loans not accounted for at fair value cash flows are discounted at quoted secondary market rates or estimated market rates if available otherwise sales of comparable loan portfolios or current market origination rates for loans with similar terms and risk characteristics are used expected credit losses are either embedded in the estimated future cash flows or incorporated as an adjustment to the discount rate used the value of collateral is also considered for liabilities such as longterm debt not accounted for at fair value and without quoted market prices market borrowing rates of interest are used to discount contractual cash flows 







 

fair values vary from period to period based on changes in a wide range of factors including interest rates credit quality and market perceptions of value and as existing assets and liabilities run off and new transactions are entered into the estimated fair values of loans reflect changes in credit status since the loans were made changes in interest rates in the case of fixedrate loans and premium values at origination of certain loans 

the estimated fair values of the company’s corporate unfunded lending commitments at december 31 2017  and december 31 2016  were liabilities of 32 billion  and 52 billion  respectively substantially all of which are classified as level 3 the company does not estimate the fair values of consumer unfunded lending commitments which are generally cancelable by providing notice to the borrower 

25 fair value elections 

the company may elect to report most financial instruments and certain other items at fair value on an instrumentbyinstrument basis with changes in fair value reported in earnings other than dva see below the election is made upon the initial recognition of an eligible financial asset financial liability or firm commitment or when certain specified reconsideration events occur the fair value election may not be revoked once an election is made the changes in

own debt valuation adjustments are recognized on citi’s liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected using citi’s credit spreads observed in the bond market effective january 1 2016 changes in fair value of fair value option liabilities related to changes in citigroup’s own credit spreads dva are reflected as a component of aoci previously these amounts were recognized in citigroup’s revenues and  net income  along with all other changes in fair value see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

       among other variables the fair value of liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected other than nonrecourse and similar liabilities is impacted by the narrowing or widening of the company’s credit spreads 

       the estimated change in the fair value of these liabilities due to such changes in the company’s own credit spread or instrumentspecific credit risk were losses of  680 million  and  538 million  for the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively changes in fair value resulting from changes in instrumentspecific credit risk were estimated by incorporating the company’s current credit spreads observable in the bond market into the relevant valuation technique used to value each liability as described above

guarantees 

citi provides a variety of guarantees and indemnifications to its customers to enhance their credit standing and enable them to complete a wide variety of business transactions for 

certain contracts meeting the definition of a guarantee the guarantor must recognize at inception a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 

in addition the guarantor must disclose the maximum potential amount of future payments that the guarantor could be required to make under the guarantee if there were a total 

default by the guaranteed parties the determination of the maximum potential future payments is based on the notional amount of the guarantees without consideration of possible recoveries under recourse provisions or from collateral held or pledged as such citi believes such amounts bear no relationship to the anticipated losses if any on these guarantees 

the following tables present information about citi’s guarantees 





 

financial standby letters of credit 

citi issues standby letters of credit which substitute its own credit for that of the borrower if a letter of credit is drawn down the borrower is obligated to repay citi standby letters of credit protect a third party from defaults on contractual obligations financial standby letters of credit include i guarantees of payment of insurance premiums and reinsurance risks that support industrial revenue bond underwriting ii settlement of payment obligations to clearing houses including futures and overthecounter derivatives clearing see further discussion below iii support options and purchases of securities in lieu of escrow deposit accounts and iv letters of credit that backstop loans credit facilities promissory notes and trade acceptances 

performance guarantees 

performance guarantees and letters of credit are issued to guarantee a customer’s tender bid on a construction or systemsinstallation project or to guarantee completion of such projects in accordance with contract terms they are also issued to support a customer’s obligation to supply specified products commodities or maintenance or warranty services to a third party 

derivative instruments considered to be guarantees 

derivatives are financial instruments whose cash flows are based on a notional amount and an underlying instrument reference credit or index where there is little or no initial investment and whose terms require or permit net settlement for a discussion of citi’s derivatives activities see note 22 to the consolidated financial statements 

derivative instruments considered to be guarantees include only those instruments that require citi to make payments to the counterparty based on changes in an underlying instrument that is related to an asset a liability or an equity security held by the guaranteed party more specifically derivative instruments considered to be 

 

guarantees include certain overthecounter written put options where the counterparty is not a bank hedge fund or brokerdealer such counterparties are considered to be dealers in these markets and may therefore not hold the underlying instruments credit derivatives sold by citi are excluded from the tables above as they are disclosed separately in note 22 to the consolidated financial statements in instances where citi’s maximum potential future payment is unlimited the notional amount of the contract is disclosed 

loans sold with recourse 

loans sold with recourse represent citi’s obligations to reimburse the buyers for loan losses under certain circumstances recourse refers to the clause in a sales agreement under which a sellerlender will fully reimburse the buyerinvestor for any losses resulting from the purchased loans this may be accomplished by the seller taking back any loans that become delinquent 

in addition to the amounts shown in the tables above citi has recorded a repurchase reserve for its potential repurchases or makewhole liability regarding residential mortgage representation and warranty claims related to its whole loan sales to the us governmentsponsored enterprises gses and to a lesser extent private investors the repurchase reserve was approximately 66 million  and 107 million  at december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively and these amounts are included in other liabilities  on the consolidated balance sheet 

securities lending indemnifications 

owners of securities frequently lend those securities for a fee to other parties who may sell them short or deliver them to another party to satisfy some other obligation banks may administer such securities lending programs for their clients securities lending indemnifications are issued by the bank to guarantee that a securities lending customer will be made 

whole in the event that the security borrower does not return the security subject to the lending agreement and collateral held is insufficient to cover the market value of the security 

credit card merchant processing 

credit card merchant processing guarantees represent the company’s indirect obligations in connection with i providing transaction processing services to various merchants with respect to its privatelabel cards and ii potential liability for bank card transaction processing services the nature of the liability in either case arises as a result of a billing dispute between a merchant and a cardholder that is ultimately resolved in the cardholder’s favor the merchant is liable to refund the amount to the cardholder in general if the credit card processing company is unable to collect this amount from the merchant the credit card processing company bears the loss for the amount of the credit or refund paid to the cardholder 

with regard to i above citi has the primary contingent liability with respect to its portfolio of privatelabel merchants the risk of loss is mitigated as the cash flows between citi and the merchant are settled on a net basis and citi has the right to offset any payments with cash flows otherwise due to the merchant to further mitigate this risk citi may delay settlement require a merchant to make an escrow deposit include event triggers to provide citi with more financial and operational control in the event of the financial deterioration of the merchant or require various credit enhancements including letters of credit and bank guarantees in the unlikely event that a privatelabel merchant is unable to deliver products services or a refund to its privatelabel cardholders citi is contingently liable to credit or refund cardholders 

with regard to ii above citi has a potential liability for bank card transactions where citi provides the transaction processing services as well as those where a third party provides the services and citi acts as a secondary guarantor should that processor fail to perform 

citi’s maximum potential contingent liability related to both bank card and privatelabel merchant processing services is estimated to be the total volume of credit card transactions that meet the requirements to be valid chargeback transactions at any given time at december 31 2017  and 2016  this maximum potential exposure was estimated to be 86 billion  and 86 billion  respectively 

however citi believes that the maximum exposure is not representative of the actual potential loss exposure based on its historical experience this contingent liability is unlikely to arise as most products and services are delivered when purchased and amounts are refunded when items are returned to merchants citi assesses the probability and amount of its contingent liability related to merchant processing based on the financial strength of the primary guarantor the extent and nature of unresolved chargebacks and its historical loss experience at december 31 2017  and 2016  the losses incurred and the carrying amounts of citi’s contingent obligations related to merchant processing activities were immaterial 

 

credit card arrangements with partners 

citi in certain of its credit card partner arrangements provides guarantees to the partner regarding the volume of certain customer originations during the term of the agreement to the extent that such origination targets are not met the guarantees serve to compensate the partner for certain payments that otherwise would have been generated in connection with such originations 

custody indemnifications 

custody indemnifications are issued to guarantee that custody clients will be made whole in the event that a thirdparty subcustodian or depository institution fails to safeguard clients’ assets 

other guarantees and indemnifications 

credit card protection programs 

citi through its credit card businesses provides various 

cardholder protection programs on several of its card 

products including programs that provide insurance 

coverage for rental cars coverage for certain losses 

associated with purchased products price protection for 

certain purchases and protection for lost luggage these 

guarantees are not included in the table since the total 

outstanding amount of the guarantees and citi’s maximum 

exposure to loss cannot be quantified the protection is 

limited to certain types of purchases and losses and it is not 

possible to quantify the purchases that would qualify for 

these benefits at any given time citi assesses the probability 

and amount of its potential liability related to these programs 

based on the extent and nature of its historical loss 

experience at december 31 2017 and 2016 the actual and estimated losses incurred and the carrying value 

of citi’s obligations related to these programs were 

immaterial 

other representation and warranty indemnifications 

in the normal course of business citi provides standard representations and warranties to counterparties in contracts in connection with numerous transactions and also provides indemnifications including indemnifications that protect the counterparties to the contracts in the event that additional taxes are owed due either to a change in the tax law or an adverse interpretation of the tax law counterparties to these transactions provide citi with comparable indemnifications while such representations warranties and indemnifications are essential components of many contractual relationships they do not represent the underlying business purpose for the transactions the indemnification clauses are often standard contractual terms related to citi’s own performance under the terms of a contract and are entered into in the normal course of business based on an assessment that the risk of loss is remote often these clauses are intended to ensure that terms of a contract are met at inception no  compensation is received for these standard representations and warranties and it is not possible to determine their fair value because they rarely if ever result in a payment in many cases there are no  stated or notional amounts included in the 

indemnification clauses and the contingencies potentially triggering the obligation to indemnify have not occurred and are not expected to occur as a result these indemnifications are not included in the tables above 

valuetransfer networks 

citi is a member of or shareholder in hundreds of valuetransfer networks vtns payment clearing and settlement systems as well as exchanges around the world as a condition of membership many of these vtns require that members stand ready to pay a pro rata share of the losses incurred by the organization due to another member’s default on its obligations citi’s potential obligations may be limited to its membership interests in the vtns contributions to the vtn’s funds or in limited cases the obligation may be unlimited the maximum exposure cannot be estimated as this would require an assessment of future claims that have not yet occurred citi believes the risk of loss is remote given historical experience with the vtns accordingly citi’s participation in vtns is not reported in the guarantees tables above and there are no  amounts reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2017  or 2016  for potential obligations that could arise from citi’s involvement with vtn associations 

longterm care insurance indemnification 

in 2000 travelers life  annuity travelers then a subsidiary of citi entered into a reinsurance agreement to transfer the risks and rewards of its longterm care ltc business to ge life now genworth financial inc or genworth then a subsidiary of the general electric company ge as part of this transaction the reinsurance obligations were provided by two regulated insurance subsidiaries of ge life which funded two  collateral trusts with securities presently as discussed below the trusts are referred to as the genworth trusts 

as part of ge’s spinoff of genworth in 2004 ge retained the risks and rewards associated with the 2000 travelers reinsurance agreement by providing a reinsurance contract to genworth through its union fidelity life insurance company uflic subsidiary that covers the travelers ltc policies in addition ge provided a capital maintenance agreement in favor of uflic which is designed to assure that uflic will have the funds to pay its reinsurance obligations as a result of these reinsurance agreements and the spinoff of genworth genworth has reinsurance protection from uflic supported by ge and has reinsurance obligations in connection with the travelers ltc policies as noted below the genworth reinsurance obligations now benefit brighthouse financial inc brighthouse while neither brighthouse nor citi are direct beneficiaries of the capital maintenance agreement between ge and uflic brighthouse and citi benefit indirectly from the existence of the capital maintenance agreement which helps assure that uflic will continue to have funds necessary to pay its reinsurance obligations to genworth 

in connection with citi’s 2005 sale of travelers to metlife inc metlife citi provided an indemnification to metlife for losses including policyholder claims relating to 

 

the ltc business for the entire term of the travelers ltc policies which as noted above are reinsured by subsidiaries of genworth in 2017 metlife spun off its retail insurance business to brighthouse as a result the travelers ltc policies now reside with brighthouse the original reinsurance agreement between travelers now brighthouse and genworth remains in place and brighthouse is the sole beneficiary of the genworth trusts the fair value of the genworth trusts is approximately 75 billion  as of december 31 2017 compared to 70 billion  at december 31 2016 the genworth trusts are designed to provide collateral to brighthouse in an amount equal to the statutory liabilities of brighthouse in respect of the travelers ltc policies the assets in the genworth trusts are evaluated and adjusted periodically to ensure that the fair value of the assets continues to provide collateral in an amount equal to these estimated statutory liabilities as the liabilities change over time 

if both i genworth fails to perform under the original travelersge life reinsurance agreement for any reason including insolvency or the failure of uflic to perform in a timely manner and ii the assets of the two genworth trusts are insufficient or unavailable then citi through its ltc reinsurance indemnification must reimburse brighthouse for any losses incurred in connection with the ltc policies since both events would have to occur before citi would become responsible for any payment to brighthouse pursuant to its indemnification obligation and the likelihood of such events occurring is currently not probable there is no  liability reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2017 and 2016 related to this indemnification citi continues to closely monitor its potential exposure under this indemnification obligation 

separately genworth announced that it had agreed to be purchased by china oceanwide holdings co ltd subject to a series of conditions and regulatory approvals citi is monitoring these developments 

futures and overthecounter derivatives clearing 

citi provides clearing services on central clearing parties ccps for clients that need to clear exchange traded and overthecounter otc derivatives contracts based on all relevant facts and circumstances citi has concluded that it acts as an agent for accounting purposes in its role as clearing member for these client transactions as such citi does not reflect the underlying exchange traded or otc derivatives contracts in its consolidated financial statements see note 22 for a discussion of citi’s derivatives activities that are reflected in its consolidated financial statements 

as a clearing member citi collects and remits cash and securities collateral margin between its clients and the respective ccp in certain circumstances citi collects a higher amount of cash or securities from its clients than it needs to remit to the ccps this excess cash is then held at depository institutions such as banks or carry brokers 

there are two  types of margin initial and variation where citi obtains benefits from or controls cash initial margin eg retains an interest spread cash initial margin 

collected from clients and remitted to the ccp or depository institutions is reflected within brokerage payables  payables to customers and brokerage receivables  receivables from brokers dealers and clearing organizations or cash and due from banks  respectively 

however for exchange traded and otccleared derivatives contracts where citi does not obtain benefits from or control the client cash balances the client cash initial margin collected from clients and remitted to the ccp or depository institutions is not reflected on citi’s consolidated balance sheet these conditions are met when citi has contractually agreed with the client that i citi will pass through to the client all interest paid by the ccp or depository institutions on the cash initial margin ii citi will not utilize its right as a clearing member to transform cash margin into other assets iii citi does not guarantee and is not liable to the client for the performance of the ccp or the depository institution and iv the client cash balances are legally isolated from citi’s bankruptcy estate the total amount of cash initial margin collected and remitted in this manner was approximately 107 billion  and 94 billion  as of december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively 

variation margin due from clients to the respective ccp or from the ccp to clients reflects changes in the value of the client’s derivative contracts for each trading day as a clearing member citi is exposed to the risk of nonperformance by clients eg failure of a client to post variation margin to the ccp for negative changes in the value of the client’s derivative contracts in the event of nonperformance by a client citi would move to close out the client’s positions the ccp would typically utilize initial margin posted by the client and held by the ccp with any remaining shortfalls required to be paid by citi as clearing member citi generally holds incremental cash or securities margin posted by the client which would typically be expected to be sufficient to mitigate citi’s credit risk in the event that the client fails to perform 

 as required by asc 86030255 securities collateral posted by clients is not recognized on citi’s consolidated balance sheet 

carrying value—guarantees and indemnifications 

at december 31 2017  and 2016  the total carrying amounts of the liabilities related to the guarantees and indemnifications included in the tables above amounted to 

 

approximately 08 billion  and  12 billion  respectively the carrying value of financial and performance guarantees is included in other liabilities for loans sold with recourse the carrying value of the liability is included in other liabilities  

collateral 

cash collateral available to citi to reimburse losses realized under these guarantees and indemnifications amounted to 46 billion  and 48 billion  at december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively securities and other marketable assets held as collateral amounted to 70 billion  and 41 billion  at december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively the majority of collateral is held to reimburse losses realized under securities lending indemnifications additionally letters of credit in favor of citi held as collateral amounted to 37 billion  and 54 billion  at december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively other property may also be available to citi to cover losses under certain guarantees and indemnifications however the value of such property has not been determined 

performance risk 

citi evaluates the performance risk of its guarantees based on the assigned referenced counterparty internal or external ratings where external ratings are used investmentgrade ratings are considered to be baabbb and above while anything below is considered noninvestment grade citi’s internal ratings are in line with the related external rating system on certain underlying referenced assets or entities ratings are not available such referenced assets are included in the “not rated” category the maximum potential amount of the future payments related to the outstanding guarantees is determined to be the notional amount of these contracts which is the par amount of the assets guaranteed 

presented in the tables below are the maximum potential amounts of future payments that are classified based upon internal and external credit ratings as previously mentioned the determination of the maximum potential future payments is based on the notional amount of the guarantees without consideration of possible recoveries under recourse provisions or from collateral held or pledged as such citi believes such amounts bear no relationship to the anticipated losses if any on these guarantees 





credit commitments and lines of credit

27 contingencies 

accounting and disclosure framework 

asc 450 governs the disclosure and recognition of loss contingencies including potential losses from litigation and regulatory matters asc 450 defines a “loss contingency” as “an existing condition situation or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss to an entity that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur” it imposes different requirements for the recognition and disclosure of loss contingencies based on the likelihood of occurrence of the contingent future event or events it distinguishes among degrees of likelihood using the following three terms “probable” meaning that “the future event or events are likely to occur” “remote” meaning that “the chance of the future event or events occurring is slight” and “reasonably possible” meaning that “the chance of the future event or events occurring is more than remote but less than likely” these three terms are used below as defined in asc 450 

accruals  asc 450 requires accrual for a loss contingency when it is “probable that one or more future events will occur confirming the fact of loss” and  “the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated” in accordance with asc 450 citigroup establishes accruals for contingencies including the litigation and regulatory matters disclosed herein when citigroup believes it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated when the reasonable estimate of the loss is within a range of amounts the minimum amount of the range is accrued unless some higher amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range once established accruals are adjusted from time to time as appropriate in light of additional information the amount of loss ultimately incurred in relation to those matters may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts accrued for those matters 

disclosure  asc 450 requires disclosure of a loss contingency if “there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may have been incurred” and  there is no accrual for the loss because the conditions described above are not met or an exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount accrued in accordance with asc 450 if citigroup has not accrued for a matter because citigroup believes that a loss is reasonably possible but not probable or that a loss is probable but not reasonably estimable and the reasonably possible loss is material it discloses the loss contingency in addition citigroup discloses matters for which it has accrued if it believes a reasonably possible exposure to material loss exists in excess of the amount accrued in accordance with asc 450 citigroup’s disclosure includes an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss for those matters as to which an estimate can be made asc 450 does not require disclosure of an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss where an estimate cannot be made neither accrual nor disclosure is required for losses that are deemed remote 

 

litigation and regulatory contingencies 

overview  in addition to the matters described below in the ordinary course of business citigroup its affiliates and subsidiaries and current and former officers directors and employees for purposes of this section sometimes collectively referred to as citigroup and related parties routinely are named as defendants in or as parties to various legal actions and proceedings certain of these actions and proceedings assert claims or seek relief in connection with alleged violations of consumer protection fair lending securities banking antifraud antitrust antimoney laundering employment and other statutory and common laws certain of these actual or threatened legal actions and proceedings include claims for substantial or indeterminate compensatory or punitive damages or for injunctive relief and in some instances seek recovery on a classwide basis 

in the ordinary course of business citigroup and related parties also are subject to governmental and regulatory examinations informationgathering requests investigations and proceedings both formal and informal certain of which may result in adverse judgments settlements fines penalties restitution disgorgement injunctions or other relief in addition certain affiliates and subsidiaries of citigroup are banks registered brokerdealers futures commission merchants investment advisers or other regulated entities and in those capacities are subject to regulation by various us state and foreign securities banking commodity futures consumer protection and other regulators in connection with formal and informal inquiries by these regulators citigroup and such affiliates and subsidiaries receive numerous requests subpoenas and orders seeking documents testimony and other information in connection with various aspects of their regulated activities from time to time citigroup and related parties also receive grand jury subpoenas and other requests for information or assistance formal or informal from federal or state law enforcement agencies including among others various united states attorneys’ offices the asset forfeiture and money laundering section and other divisions of the department of justice the financial crimes enforcement network of the united states department of the treasury and the federal bureau of investigation relating to citigroup and its customers 

because of the global scope of citigroup’s operations and its presence in countries around the world citigroup and related parties are subject to litigation and governmental and regulatory examinations informationgathering requests investigations and proceedings both formal and informal in multiple jurisdictions with legal and regulatory regimes that may differ substantially and present substantially different risks from those citigroup and related parties are subject to in the united states in some instances citigroup and related parties may be involved in proceedings involving the same subject matter in multiple jurisdictions which may result in overlapping cumulative or inconsistent outcomes 

citigroup seeks to resolve all litigation and regulatory matters in the manner management believes is in the best interests of citigroup and its shareholders and contests liability allegations of wrongdoing and where applicable the 

amount of damages or scope of any penalties or other relief sought as appropriate in each pending matter 

inherent uncertainty of the matters disclosed  certain of the matters disclosed below involve claims for substantial or indeterminate damages the claims asserted in these matters typically are broad often spanning a multiyear period and sometimes a wide range of business activities and the plaintiffs’ or claimants’ alleged damages frequently are not quantified or factually supported in the complaint or statement of claim other matters relate to regulatory investigations or proceedings as to which there may be no objective basis for quantifying the range of potential fine penalty or other remedy as a result citigroup is often unable to estimate the loss in such matters even if it believes that a loss is probable or reasonably possible until developments in the case or investigation have yielded additional information sufficient to support a quantitative assessment of the range of reasonably possible loss such developments may include among other things discovery from adverse parties or third parties rulings by the court on key issues analysis by retained experts and engagement in settlement negotiations depending on a range of factors such as the complexity of the facts the novelty of the legal theories the pace of discovery the court’s scheduling order the timing of court decisions and the adverse party’s willingness to negotiate in good faith toward a resolution it may be months or years after the filing of a case or commencement of an investigation before an estimate of the range of reasonably possible loss can be made 

matters as to which an estimate can be made  for some of the matters disclosed below citigroup is currently able to estimate a reasonably possible loss or range of loss in excess of amounts accrued if any for some of the matters included within this estimation an accrual has been made because a loss is believed to be both probable and reasonably estimable but an exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount accrued in these cases the estimate reflects the reasonably possible range of loss in excess of the accrued amount for other matters included within this estimation no accrual has been made because a loss although estimable is believed to be reasonably possible but not probable in these cases the estimate reflects the reasonably possible loss or range of loss as of december 31 2017 citigroup estimates that the reasonably possible unaccrued loss for these matters ranges up to approximately 10 billion  in the aggregate 

these estimates are based on currently available information as available information changes the matters for which citigroup is able to estimate will change and the estimates themselves will change in addition while many estimates presented in financial statements and other financial disclosures involve significant judgment and may be subject to significant uncertainty estimates of the range of reasonably possible loss arising from litigation and regulatory proceedings are subject to particular uncertainties for example at the time of making an estimate i citigroup may have only preliminary incomplete or inaccurate information about the facts underlying the claim ii its assumptions about the future rulings of the court or other tribunal on significant issues or the behavior and incentives of adverse parties or regulators may prove to be wrong and iii the outcomes it is 

 

attempting to predict are often not amenable to the use of statistical or other quantitative analytical tools in addition from time to time an outcome may occur that citigroup had not accounted for in its estimate because it had deemed such an outcome to be remote for all of these reasons the amount of loss in excess of accruals ultimately incurred for the matters as to which an estimate has been made could be substantially higher or lower than the range of loss included in the estimate 

matters as to which an estimate cannot be made  for other matters disclosed below citigroup is not currently able to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss many of these matters remain in very preliminary stages even in some cases where a substantial period of time has passed since the commencement of the matter with few or no substantive legal decisions by the court or tribunal defining the scope of the claims the class if any or the potentially available damages and fact discovery is still in progress or has not yet begun in many of these matters citigroup has not yet answered the complaint or statement of claim or asserted its defenses nor has it engaged in any negotiations with the adverse party whether a regulator or a private party for all these reasons citigroup cannot at this time estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss if any for these matters 

opinion of management as to eventual outcome  subject to the foregoing it is the opinion of citigroup’s management based on current knowledge and after taking into account its current legal accruals that the eventual outcome of all matters described in this note would not be likely to have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition of citigroup nonetheless given the substantial or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and the inherent unpredictability of such matters an adverse outcome in certain of these matters could from time to time have a material adverse effect on citigroup’s consolidated results of operations or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods 

card act matter

credit risk 

overview 

credit risk is the potential for financial loss resulting from the deterioration in creditworthiness or the failure of a borrower counterparty or others to honor its financial or contractual obligations credit risk arises in many of citigroup’s business activities including 

 

credit risk also arises from settlement and clearing activities when citi transfers an asset in advance of receiving its countervalue or advances funds to settle a transaction on behalf of a client concentration risk within credit risk is the risk associated with having credit exposure concentrated within a specific client industry region or other category 

credit risk is one of the most significant risks citi faces as an institution as a result citi has a wellestablished framework in place for managing credit risk across all businesses this includes a defined risk appetite credit limits and credit policies both at the business level as well as at the companywide level citi’s credit risk management also includes processes and policies with respect to problem recognition including “watch lists” portfolio reviews stress tests updated risk ratings and classification triggers 

with respect to citi’s settlement and clearing activities intraday client usage of lines is monitored against limits as well as against usage patterns to the extent a problem develops citi typically moves the client to a secured collateralized operating model generally citi’s intraday settlement and clearing lines are uncommitted and cancelable at any time 

to manage concentration of risk within credit risk citi has in place a correlation framework consisting of industry limits an idiosyncratic framework consisting of single name concentrations for each business and across citigroup and a specialized framework consisting of product limits 

credit exposures are generally reported in notional terms for accrual loans reflecting the value at which the loans as well as loan and other offbalance sheet commitments are carried on the consolidated balance sheet credit exposure arising from capital markets activities is generally expressed as the current marktomarket net of margin reflecting the net value owed to citi by a given counterparty 

the credit risk associated with these credit exposures is a function of the idiosyncratic creditworthiness of the obligor as well as the terms and conditions of the specific obligation citi assesses the credit risk associated with its credit exposures on a regular basis through its loan loss reserve process see “significant accounting policies and significant estimates—allowance for credit losses” below and notes 1 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements as well as through regular stress testing at the company business geography and product levels these stresstesting processes typically estimate 

 

potential incremental credit costs that would occur as a result of either downgrades in the credit quality or defaults of the obligors or counterparties

home equity loans—revolving helocs 

as set forth in the table above citi had 190 billion of home equity loans as of december 31 2016  of which 50 billion are fixedrate home equity loans and 140 billion are extended under home equity lines of credit revolving helocs fixedrate home equity loans are fully amortizing revolving helocs allow for amounts to be drawn for a period of time with the payment of interest only and then at the end of the draw period the thenoutstanding amount is converted to an amortizing loan or “reset” the interestonly payment feature during the revolving period is standard for this product across the industry upon reset these borrowers will be required to pay both interest usually at a variable rate and principal that amortizes typically over 20 years rather than the standard 30year amortization 

of the revolving helocs at december 31 2016 62 billion had reset compared to 42 billion at december 31 2015  and 78 billion were still within their revolving period and had not reset compared to 123 billion at december 31 2015  the following chart indicates the fico and combined loantovalue cltv characteristics of citi’s revolving helocs portfolio and the year in which they reset 

 



note totals may not sum due to rounding 

approximately 44 of citi’s total revolving helocs portfolio had reset as of december 31 2016  compared to 25 as of december 31 2015  of the remaining revolving helocs portfolio approximately 42 will reset during 2017 citi’s customers with revolving helocs that reset could experience “payment shock” due to the higher required payments on the loans citi currently estimates that the monthly loan payment for its revolving helocs that reset during 2017 could increase on average by approximately 362 or 151 increases in interest rates could further increase these payments given the variable nature of the interest rates on these loans postreset of the revolving helocs that will reset during 2017 approximately 111 million or 3 of the loans have a cltv greater than 100 as of december 31 2016  borrowers’ high loantovalue positions as well as the cost and availability of refinancing options could limit borrowers’ ability to refinance their revolving helocs as these loans reset 

approximately 67 of the revolving helocs that have reset as of december 31 2016  were 30 days past due compared to 39 of the total outstanding home equity loan portfolio amortizing and nonamortizing this compared to 67 and 32 respectively as of december 31 2015  as newly amortizing loans continue to season the delinquency rate of citi’s total home equity loan portfolio could continue to increase in addition resets to date have generally occurred during a period of historically low interest rates which citi believes has likely reduced the overall “payment shock” to the borrower 

citi monitors this reset risk closely and will continue to consider any potential impact in determining its allowance for loan loss reserves in addition management continues to review and take additional actions to offset potential reset risk such as a borrower outreach program to provide reset risk education and proactively working with highrisk borrowers through a specialized single point of contact unit 

gcb commercial banking exposure to the energy and energyrelated sector 

in addition to the total corporate credit exposure to the energy and energyrelated sector described under “corporate credit” below citi’s commercial banking business reported within gcb  retail banking had total credit exposure to the energy and energyrelated sector of approximately 19 billion as of december 31 2016 with approximately 13 billion of direct outstanding funded loans or 4 of the total outstanding commercial banking loans this compared to 20 billion and 24 billion of total credit exposure as of september 30 2016 and december 31 2015 respectively

portfolio mix—geography counterparty and industry 

citi’s corporate credit portfolio is diverse across geography and counterparty the following table shows the percentage by region based on citi’s internal management geography 



the maintenance of accurate and consistent risk ratings across the corporate credit portfolio facilitates the comparison of credit exposure across all lines of business geographic regions and products counterparty risk ratings reflect an estimated probability of default for a counterparty and are derived primarily through the use of validated statistical models scorecard models and external agency ratings under defined circumstances in combination with consideration of factors specific to the obligor or market such as management experience competitive position regulatory environment and commodity prices facility risk ratings are assigned that reflect the probability of default of the obligor and factors that affect the lossgivendefault of the facility such as support or collateral internal obligor ratings that generally correspond to bbb and above are considered investment grade while those below are considered noninvestment grade 

 

citigroup also has incorporated climate risk assessment and reporting criteria for certain obligors as necessary factors evaluated include consideration of climate risk to an 

obligor’s business and physical assets and when relevant consideration of costeffective options to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 

the following table presents the corporate credit portfolio by facility risk rating as a percentage of the total corporate credit portfolio

credit risk mitigation 

as part of its overall risk management activities citigroup uses credit derivatives and other risk mitigants to hedge portions of the credit risk in its corporate credit portfolio in addition to outright asset sales the results of the marktomarket and any realized gains or losses on credit derivatives are reflected primarily in other revenue  on the consolidated statement of income 

as of december 31 2016  september 30 2016  and december 31 2015  295 billion 378 billion and 345 billion respectively of the corporate credit portfolio was economically hedged citigroup’s expected loss model used in the calculation of its loan loss reserve does not include the favorable impact of credit derivatives and other mitigants that are markedtomarket in addition the reported amounts of direct outstandings and unfunded lending commitments in the tables above do not reflect the impact of these hedging transactions the credit protection was economically hedging underlying corporate credit portfolio exposures with the following risk rating distribution

liquidity risk 

overview 

adequate and diverse sources of funding and liquidity are essential to citi’s businesses funding and liquidity risks arise from several factors many of which are mostly or entirely outside citi’s control such as disruptions in the financial markets changes in key funding sources credit spreads changes in citi’s credit ratings and political and economic conditions in certain countries for additional information see “risk factors” above 

citi’s funding and liquidity objectives are aimed at i funding its existing asset base ii growing its core businesses in citicorp iii maintaining sufficient liquidity structured appropriately so that citi can operate under a variety of adverse circumstances including potential firmspecific andor market liquidity events in varying durations and severity and iv satisfying regulatory requirements citigroup’s primary liquidity objectives are established by entity and in aggregate across two major categories 

  

 

at an aggregate level citigroup’s goal is to maintain sufficient funding in amount and tenor to fully fund customer assets and to provide an appropriate amount of cash and highquality liquid assets as discussed further below even in times of stress the liquidity risk management framework provides that certain entities be selfsufficient or net providers of liquidity including in conditions established under their designated stress tests 

 

citi’s primary sources of funding include i deposits via citi’s bank subsidiaries which are citi’s most stable and lowest cost source of longterm funding ii longterm debt primarily senior and subordinated debt primarily issued at the parent and certain bank subsidiaries and iii stockholders’ equity these sources may be supplemented by shortterm borrowings primarily in the form of secured funding transactions 

as referenced above citigroup works to ensure that the structural tenor of these funding sources is sufficiently long in relation to the tenor of its asset base the goal of citi’s assetliability management is to ensure that there is excess tenor in the liability structure relative to the liquidity profile of the assets this reduces the risk that liabilities will become due before asset maturities or monetizations through sale and in turn generates liquidity this liquidity is held primarily in the form of highquality liquid assets hqla as set forth in the table below 

citi’s treasurer has overall responsibility for management of citi’s hqla citi’s liquidity is managed via a centralized treasury model by corporate treasury in conjunction with regional and incountry treasurers pursuant to this approach citi’s hqla is managed with emphasis on assetliability management and entitylevel liquidity adequacy throughout citi 

citi’s chief risk officer is responsible for the overall risk profile of citi’s hqla the chief risk officer and citi’s cfo cochair citi’s asset liability management committee alco which includes citi’s treasurer and other senior executives alco sets the strategy of the liquidity portfolio and monitors its performance significant changes to portfolio asset allocations need to be approved by alco 

highquality liquid assets hqla 



note except as indicated amounts set forth in the table above are as of period end and may increase or decrease intraperiod in the ordinary course of business for securities the amounts represent the liquidity value that potentially could be realized and thus exclude any securities that are encumbered as well as the haircuts that would be required for securities financing transactions the federal reserve board adopted final rules requiring disclosure of hqla the liquidity coverage ratio and related components on an average basis each quarter as compared to endofperiod starting on april 1 2017 for additional information see “liquidity coverage ratio lcr” below citi has presented in this form 10k the average information on these metrics currently available which includes average total hqla average lcr and average net outflows under the lcr other component information is not currently available 



as set forth in the table above sequentially citi’s total hqla decreased on an endofperiod basis and remained largely unchanged on an average basis the endofperiod decrease was driven primarily by   a slight decline in deposits  

citi’s hqla as set forth above does not include citi’s available borrowing capacity from the federal home loan banks fhlb of which citi is a member which was approximately 21 billion as of december 31 2016  compared to 24 billion as of september 30 2016  and 36 billion as of december 31 2015 and maintained by eligible collateral pledged to such banks the hqla also does not include citi’s borrowing capacity at the us federal reserve bank discount window or other central banks which would be in addition to the resources noted above 

in general citi’s liquidity is fungible across legal entities within its bank group citi’s bank subsidiaries including citibank can lend to the citi parent and brokerdealer entities in accordance with section 23a of the federal reserve act as of december 31 2016  the capacity available for lending to these entities under section 23a was approximately 15 billion unchanged from september 30 2016 and compared to 17 billion as of december 31 2015 subject to certain eligible noncash collateral requirements 

loans 

as part of its funding and liquidity objectives citi seeks to fund its existing asset base appropriately as well as maintain sufficient liquidity to grow its core businesses in citicorp including its loan portfolio citi maintains a diversified portfolio of loans to its consumer and institutional clients the table below sets forth the endofperiod loans by business andor segment and the total average loans for each of the periods indicated 



 

 

endofperiod loans increased 1 yearoveryear and declined 2 sequentially excluding the impact of fx translation citigroup’s endofperiod loans increased 3 yearoveryear as growth in citicorp more than offset continued declines in citi holdings sequentially citigroup’s endofperiod loans decreased 1 driven by declines in icg  and citi holdings which more than offset the increase in gcb  

excluding the impact of fx translation citicorp loans increased 6 yearoveryear gcb  loans grew 8 yearoveryear driven by 14 growth in north america  within north america citibranded cards increased 28 driven primarily by the acquisition of the costco portfolio toward the end of the second quarter of 2016 international gcb  loans declined 2 as 7 growth in mexico was more than offset by a 5 decline in asia  reflecting citi’s continued optimization of its portfolio in this region to generate higher returns icg  loans grew 4 yearoveryear driven by growth in lending to the high net worth target clients in its private banking segment   corporate lending declined 1 primarily driven by repayments near the end of the fourth quarter of 2016 this type of activity is not unusual as changes in balances are driven by the episodic nature of clients’ needs treasury and trade solutions loans increased 1 as citi continued to support its clients while utilizing its distribution capabilities to optimize the balance sheet and drive returns 

excluding the impact of fx translation citi holdings loans decreased 33 yearoveryear driven by over 9 billion of reductions in north america  mortgages including transfers to heldforsale 

deposits 

deposits are citi’s primary and lowest cost funding source the table below sets forth the endofperiod deposits by business andor segment and the total average deposits for each of the periods indicated 



 

endofperiod deposits increased 2 yearoveryear and declined 1 sequentially excluding the impact of fx translation citigroup’s endofperiod deposits increased 4 yearoveryear and 1 sequentially with continued highquality deposit flows across the franchise 

excluding the impact of fx translation citicorp deposits grew 5 yearoveryear within citicorp gcb  deposits increased 3 yearoveryear primarily driven by growth in international gcb  icg  deposits increased 6 yearoveryear driven primarily by growth in treasury and trade solutions 

longterm debt 

longterm debt generally defined as debt with original maturities of one year or more represents the most significant component of citi’s funding for the parent entities and is a supplementary source of funding for the bank entities 

longterm debt is an important funding source due in part to its multiyear contractual maturity structure the weightedaverage maturities of unsecured longterm debt issued by citigroup and its affiliates including citibank with a remaining life greater than one year excluding remaining trust preferred securities outstanding was approximately 70 years as of december 31 2016  unchanged sequentially and a slight increase from 69 years from the prior year 

citi’s longterm debt outstanding at the parent includes senior and subordinated debt and what citi refers to as customerrelated debt consisting of structured notes such as equity and creditlinked notes as well as nonstructured notes citi’s issuance of customerrelated debt is generally driven by customer demand and supplements benchmark debt 

 

issuance as a source of funding for citi’s parent entities citi’s longterm debt at the bank also includes fhlb advances and securitizations 

longterm debt outstanding 

the following table sets forth citi’s total longterm debt outstanding for the periods indicated 



note amounts represent the current value of longterm debt on citi’s consolidated balance sheet which for certain debt instruments includes consideration of fair value hedging impacts and unamortized discounts and premiums 

 

citi’s total longterm debt outstanding increased yearoveryear but declined sequentially the increase yearoveryear was primarily driven by an increase in senior debt at the parent partially offset by declines in securitizations at the bank sequentially citi’s longterm debt outstanding decreased modestly driven primarily by a decline at the bank as parent debt remained relatively unchanged 

as part of its liability management citi has considered and may continue to consider opportunities to repurchase its longterm debt pursuant to open market purchases tender offers or other means such repurchases help reduce citi’s overall funding costs and assist it in meeting regulatory changes and requirements during 2016 citi repurchased an aggregate of approximately 59 billion of its outstanding longterm debt including early redemptions of fhlb advances 

longterm debt issuances and maturities 

the table below details citi’s longterm debt issuances and maturities including repurchases and redemptions during the periods presented 



the table below shows citi’s aggregate longterm debt maturities including repurchases and redemptions in 2016 as well as its aggregate expected annual longterm debt maturities as of december 31 2016  

resolution plan 

under title i of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 doddfrank act citigroup has developed a “single point of entry” resolution strategy and plan under the us bankruptcy code resolution plan under citi’s resolution plan only citigroup the parent holding company would enter into bankruptcy while citigroup’s key operating subsidiaries including citibank among others would remain operational and outside of any resolution or insolvency proceedings citigroup believes its resolution plan has been designed to minimize the risk of systemic impact to the us and global financial systems while maximizing the value of the bankruptcy estate for the benefit of citigroup’s creditors including its unsecured longterm debt holders in addition in line with the federal reserve board’s final tlac rule citigroup believes it has developed the resolution plan so that citigroup’s shareholders and unsecured creditors—including its unsecured longterm debt holders—bear any losses resulting from citigroup’s bankruptcy 

in response to feedback received from the federal reserve board and fdic the agencies on citi’s 2015 resolution plan citi currently expects to take the following actions in connection with its 2017 resolution plan submission to be submitted by july 1 2017 

 

 

 

 

citigroup also expects that the citi support agreement will provide two mechanisms besides citicorp’s issuing of dividends to citigroup pursuant to which citicorp would be required to transfer cash to citigroup during business as usual so that citigroup can fund its debt service as well as other operating needs i one or more funding notes issued by citicorp to citigroup and ii a committed line of credit under which citicorp may make loans to citigroup 

total lossabsorbing capacity   tlac 

in december 2016 the federal reserve board released a final rule which imposes minimum external lossabsorbing capacity tlac and longterm debt ltd requirements on us global systemically important bank holding companies gsibs including citi the intended purpose of the final rule is to facilitate the orderly resolution of us gsibs under the us bankruptcy code and title ii of the doddfrank act the effective date for all requirements under the final rule is january 1 2019 while final there are uncertainties regarding certain key aspects of the final rule for additional information see “risk factors—strategic risks” above for an additional discussion of the method 1 and method 2 gsib capital surcharge methodology see “capital resources— current regulatory capital standards” above 

under the federal reserve board’s final rule us gsibs will be required to maintain minimum levels of tlac and eligible ltd each set by reference to the gsib’s consolidated riskweighted assets rwa and total leverage exposure and as described further below 

in response to the final tlac rule citigroup supplemented its senior debt indenture in december 2016 to among other things limit the circumstances under which future issuances of senior debt issued pursuant to the indenture can be accelerated as required by the final rule and referenced below

the minimum tlac requirement is the greater  of i 18 of the gsib’s rwa plus the thenapplicable rwabased tlac buffer see below and ii 75 of the gsib’s total leverage exposure plus a leveragedbased tlac buffer of 2 ie 95 the rwabased tlac buffer equals the 25 capital conservation buffer plus any applicable countercyclical capital buffer currently 0 plus the gsib’s capital surcharge as determined under method 1 of the gsib surcharge rule 20 for citi as of january 1 2017 accordingly citi estimates its total current minimum tlac requirement is 225 of rwa under the final rule pursuant to the final rule tlac may generally only consist of the gsib’s i common equity tier 1 capital and additional tier 1 capital issued directly by the bank holding company excluding qualifying trust preferred securities plus ii eligible ltd as discussed below breach of either the rwa or leveragedbased tlac buffer would result in restrictions on distributions and discretionary bonus payments 

minimum eligible ltd requirements 

the minimum ltd requirement is the greater  of i 6 of the gsib’s rwa plus its capital surcharge as determined under 

method 2 of the gsib surcharge rule 30 for citi as of january 1 2017 for a total current requirement of 9 of rwa for citi and ii 45 of the gsib’s total leverage exposure 

generally under the final rule eligible ltd is defined as the unpaid principal balance of unsecured “plain vanilla” debt securities ie would not include certain of citi’s customerrelated debt issued directly by the bank holding company governed by us law with a remaining maturity greater than one year and which provides for acceleration only upon the occurrence of insolvency or nonpayment of principal or interest for 30 days or more further pursuant to what has been referred to as the “haircut” provision otherwise eligible ltd with a remaining maturity between one and two years is subject to a 50 haircut for purposes of meeting the minimum ltd requirement although such ltd would continue to count at full value for purposes of the minimum tlac requirement eligible ltd with a remaining maturity of less than one year would not count toward either the minimum tlac or eligible ltd requirement the final rule provides that debt issued prior to december 31 2016 with acceleration provisions other than those summarized above or governed by nonus law is permanently grandfathered and may count as eligible ltd assuming it otherwise meets the requirements of eligible ltd 

clean holding company requirements 

the final rule prohibits or limits certain financial arrangements at the bank holding company level or what are referred to as “clean holding company” requirements pursuant to these requirements citi as the bank holding company is prohibited from having certain types of thirdparty liabilities including shortterm debt certain derivatives and other qualified financial contracts liabilities guaranteed by a subsidiary ie upstream guarantees and guarantees of subsidiary liabilities or similar arrangements if the liability or guarantee includes a default right linked to the insolvency of the bank holding company ie downstream guarantees with cross default provisions in addition the final rule limits thirdparty noncontingent liabilities of the bank holding company other than those related to tlac or eligible ltd to 5 of the us gsib’s outstanding tlac examples of the types of liabilities subject to this 5 limit include structured notes and various operating liabilities such as rent and obligations to employees as well as litigation and similar liabilities 

 

secured funding transactions and shortterm borrowings 

as referenced above citi supplements its primary sources of funding with shortterm borrowings shortterm borrowings generally include i secured funding transactions securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase or repos and ii to a lesser extent shortterm borrowings consisting of commercial paper and borrowings from the fhlb and other market participants see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on citigroup’s and its affiliates’ outstanding shortterm borrowings 

outside of secured funding transactions citi’s shortterm borrowings increased both yearoveryear a 46 increase and sequentially a 4 increase driven by an increase in fhlb borrowing as citi continued to optimize liquidity across its legal vehicles 

secured funding 

secured funding is primarily accessed through citi’s brokerdealer subsidiaries to fund efficiently both secured lending activity and a portion of securities inventory held in the context of market making and customer activities citi also executes a smaller portion of its secured funding transactions through its bank entities which is typically collateralized by foreign government debt securities generally daily changes in the level of citi’s secured funding are primarily due to fluctuations in secured lending activity in the matched book as described below and securities inventory 

secured funding of 142 billion as of december 31 2016  declined 3 from the prioryear period and 7 sequentially excluding the impact of fx translation secured funding increased 1 from the prioryear period and decreased 5 sequentially both driven by normal business activity average balances for secured funding were approximately 150 billion for the quarter ended december 31 2016  

the portion of secured funding in the brokerdealer subsidiaries that funds secured lending is commonly referred to as “matched book” activity the majority of this activity is secured by high quality liquid securities such as us treasury securities us agency securities and foreign government debt securities other secured funding is secured by less liquid securities including equity securities corporate bonds and assetbacked securities the tenor of citi’s matched book liabilities is generally equal to or longer than the tenor of the corresponding matched book assets 

the remainder of the secured funding activity in the brokerdealer subsidiaries serves to fund securities inventory held in the context of market making and customer activities to maintain reliable funding under a wide range of market conditions including under periods of stress citi manages these activities by taking into consideration the quality of the underlying collateral and stipulating financing tenor the weighted average maturity of citi’s secured funding of less liquid securities inventory was greater than 110 days as of december 31 2016  

citi manages the risks in its secured funding by conducting daily stress tests to account for changes in capacity tenors haircut collateral profile and client actions additionally citi maintains counterparty diversification by 

establishing concentration triggers and assessing counterparty reliability and stability under stress citi generally sources secured funding from more than 150 counterparties 

 

overall shortterm borrowings 

as required by sec rules the following table contains the yearend average and maximum monthend amounts for the following respective shortterm borrowings categories at the end of each of the three prior fiscal years 



 

liquidity monitoring and measurement 

stress testing 

liquidity stress testing is performed for each of citi’s major entities operating subsidiaries andor countries stress testing and scenario analyses are intended to quantify the potential impact of a liquidity event on the balance sheet and liquidity position and to identify viable funding alternatives that can be utilized these scenarios include assumptions about significant changes in key funding sources market triggers such as credit ratings potential uses of funding and political and economic conditions in certain countries these conditions include expected and stressed market conditions as well as companyspecific events 

liquidity stress tests are conducted to ascertain potential mismatches between liquidity sources and uses over a variety of time horizons overnight one week two weeks one month three months one year and over a variety of stressed conditions liquidity limits are set accordingly to monitor the liquidity of an entity these stress tests and potential mismatches are calculated with varying frequencies with several tests performed daily 

given the range of potential stresses citi maintains a series of contingency funding plans on a consolidated basis and for individual entities these plans specify a wide range of readily available actions for a variety of adverse market conditions or idiosyncratic stresses 

shortterm liquidity measurement liquidity coverage ratio lcr 

in addition to internal measures that citi has developed for a 30day stress scenario citi also monitors its liquidity by reference to the lcr as calculated pursuant to the us lcr rules 

generally the lcr is designed to ensure that banks maintain an adequate level of hqla to meet liquidity needs under an acute 30day stress scenario the lcr is calculated by dividing hqla by estimated net outflows over a stressed 30day period with the net outflows determined by applying prescribed outflow factors to various categories of liabilities such as deposits unsecured and secured wholesale borrowings unused lending commitments and derivativesrelated exposures partially offset by inflows from assets maturing within 30 days banks are required to calculate an addon to address potential maturity mismatches between contractual cash outflows and inflows within the 30day period in determining the total amount of net outflows the minimum lcr requirement is 100 effective january 2017 

in december 2016 the federal reserve board adopted final rules which require additional disclosures relating to the lcr of large financial institutions including citi among other things the final rules require citi to disclose components of its average hqla lcr and inflows and outflows each quarter in addition the final rules require disclosure of citi’s calculation of the maturity mismatch addon as well as other qualitative disclosures the effective date for these disclosures is april 1 2017 

 

the table below sets forth the components of citi’s lcr calculation and hqla in excess of net outflows for the periods indicated 



note amounts set forth in the table above are presented on an average basis 

as set forth in the table above citi’s lcr increased both yearoveryear and sequentially the increase yearoveryear was driven by both an increase in hqla and a reduction in net outflows sequentially the increase was driven by a slight reduction in net outflows as hqla remained largely unchanged 

longterm liquidity measurement net stable funding ratio nsfr 

in the second quarter of 2016 the federal reserve board the fdic and the occ issued a proposed rule to implement the basel iii nsfr requirement 

the usproposed nsfr is largely consistent with the basel committee’s final nsfr rules in general the nsfr assesses the availability of a bank’s stable funding against a required level a bank’s available stable funding would include portions of equity deposits and longterm debt while its required stable funding would be based on the liquidity characteristics of its assets derivatives and commitments standardized weightings would be required to be applied to the various asset and liabilities classes the ratio of available stable funding to required stable funding would be required to be greater than 100 while citi believes that it is compliant with the proposed us nsfr rules as of december 31 2016 it will need to evaluate any final version of the rules which are expected to be released during 2017 the proposed rules would require full implementation of the us nsfr beginning january 1 2018 

credit ratings 

citigroup’s funding and liquidity funding capacity ability to access capital markets and other sources of funds the cost of these funds and its ability to maintain certain deposits are partially dependent on its credit ratings 

the table below sets forth the ratings for citigroup and citibank as of december 31 2016  while not included in the table below the longterm and shortterm ratings of citigroup global markets inc cgmi were “a2p1” at moody’s “aa1” at standard  poor’s and “af1” at fitch as of december 31 2016  the longterm and shortterm ratings of citigroup global markets holdings inc cgmhi were “bbba2” at standard  poor’s and “af1” at fitch as of december 31 2016  



recent credit rating developments 

on december 13 2016 fitch affirmed citigroup inc’s viability rating vr and longterm issuer default rating idr at “aa” respectively at the same time fitch affirmed citibank’s vr and idr at “aa” respectively the outlooks for the longterm idrs are stable 

on december 16 2016 sp amended its additional lossabsorbing capacity alac criteria to include existing senior unsecured debt and concluded their credit watch on four of the us gsibs including citigroup resulting in a onenotch upgrade on their core and highly strategic operating subsidiaries consequently sp upgraded citibank’s longterm rating from “a” to “a” with its shortterm rating remaining at “a1” citibank’s ratings outlook was changed to “stable” from “credit watch positive” as of december 31 2016 citigroup inc is in excess of the 85 threshold deemed necessary to receive the maximum two notches of alac support 

potential impacts of ratings downgrades 

ratings downgrades by moody’s fitch or sp could negatively impact citigroup’s andor citibank’s funding and liquidity due to reduced funding capacity including derivatives triggers which could take the form of cash obligations and collateral requirements 

the following information is provided for the purpose of analyzing the potential funding and liquidity impact to citigroup and citibank of a hypothetical simultaneous 

ratings downgrade across all three major rating agencies this analysis is subject to certain estimates estimation methodologies judgments and uncertainties uncertainties include potential ratings limitations that certain entities may have with respect to permissible counterparties as well as general subjective counterparty behavior for example certain corporate customers and markets counterparties could reevaluate their business relationships with citi and limit 

 

transactions in certain contracts or market instruments with citi changes in counterparty behavior could impact citi’s funding and liquidity as well as the results of operations of certain of its businesses the actual impact to citigroup or citibank is unpredictable and may differ materially from the potential funding and liquidity impacts described below for additional information on the impact of credit rating changes on citi and its applicable subsidiaries see “risk factors—liquidity risks” above 

citigroup inc and citibank—potential derivative triggers 

as of december 31 2016  citi estimates that a hypothetical onenotch downgrade of the senior debtlongterm rating of citigroup inc across all three major rating agencies could impact citigroup’s funding and liquidity due to derivative triggers by approximately 04 billion compared to 05 billion as of september 30 2016  other funding sources such as securities financing transactions and other margin requirements for which there are no explicit triggers could also be adversely affected 

as of december 31 2016  citi estimates that a hypothetical onenotch downgrade of the senior debtlongterm rating of citibank across all three major rating agencies could impact citibank’s funding and liquidity by approximately 12 billion compared to 13 billion as of september 30 2016  due to derivative triggers 

in total citi estimates that a onenotch downgrade of citigroup and citibank across all three major rating agencies could result in aggregate cash obligations and collateral requirements of approximately 16 billion compared to 18 billion as of september 30 2016  see also note 22 to the consolidated financial statements as set forth under “highquality liquid assets” above the liquidity resources of citibank were approximately 346 billion and the liquidity resources of citi’s nonbank and other entities were approximately 58 billion for a total of approximately 404 billion as of december 31 2016  these liquidity resources are available in part as a contingency for the potential events described above 

in addition a broad range of mitigating actions are currently included in citigroup’s and citibank’s contingency funding plans for citigroup these mitigating factors include but are not limited to accessing surplus funding capacity from existing clients tailoring levels of secured lending and adjusting the size of select trading books and collateralized borrowings from certain citibank subsidiaries mitigating actions available to citibank include but are not limited to selling or financing highly liquid government securities tailoring levels of secured lending adjusting the size of select trading assets reducing loan originations and renewals raising additional deposits or borrowing from the fhlb or central banks citi believes these mitigating actions could substantially reduce the funding and liquidity risk if any of the potential downgrades described above 

citibank—additional potential impacts 

in addition to the above derivative triggers citi believes that a potential onenotch downgrade of citibank’s senior debtlongterm rating by sp could also have an adverse impact on the commercial papershortterm rating of citibank as of december 31 2016  citibank had liquidity commitments of approximately 100 billion to consolidated assetbacked commercial paper conduits compared to 101 billion as of september 30 2016  as referenced in note 21 to the consolidated financial statements 

in addition to the abovereferenced liquidity resources of certain citibank and citibanamex entities citibank could reduce the funding and liquidity risk if any of the potential downgrades described above through mitigating actions including repricing or reducing certain commitments to commercial paper conduits in the event of the potential downgrades described above citi believes that certain corporate customers could reevaluate their deposit relationships with citibank this reevaluation could result in clients adjusting their discretionary deposit levels or changing their depository institution which could potentially reduce certain deposit levels at citibank however citi could choose to adjust pricing offer alternative deposit products to its existing customers or seek to attract deposits from new customers in addition to the mitigating actions referenced above 

market risk 

overview 

market risk is the potential for losses arising from changes in the value of citi’s assets and liabilities resulting from changes in market variables such as interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices commodity prices and credit spreads as well as their implied volatilities 

each business is required to establish with approval from citi’s market risk management a market risk limit framework for identified risk factors that clearly defines approved risk profiles and is within the parameters of citi’s overall risk appetite these limits are monitored by the risk organization citi’s country and business asset and liability committees and the citigroup asset and liability committee in all cases the businesses are ultimately responsible for the market risks taken and for remaining within their defined limits 

market risk emanates from both citi’s trading and nontrading portfolios trading portfolios comprise all assets and liabilities markedtomarket with results reflected in earnings nontrading portfolios include all other assets and liabilities 

market risk of nontrading portfolios       

market risk from nontrading portfolios stems from the potential impact of changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates on citi’s net interest revenues the changes in accumulated   other comprehensive income loss  aoci from its investment portfolios and capital invested in foreign currencies 

net interest revenue at risk 

net interest revenue for interest rate exposure purposes is the difference between the yield earned on the nontrading portfolio assets including customer loans and the rate paid on the liabilities including customer deposits or company borrowings net interest revenue is affected by changes in the level of interest rates as well as the amounts and mix of assets and liabilities and the timing of contractual and assumed repricing of assets and liabilities to reflect market rates 

  citi’s principal measure of risk to net interest revenue is interest rate exposure ire ire measures the change in expected net interest revenue in each currency resulting solely from unanticipated changes in forward interest rates 

citi’s estimated ire incorporates various assumptions including prepayment rates on loans customer behavior and the impact of pricing decisions for example in rising interest rate scenarios portions of the deposit portfolio may be assumed to experience rate increases that are less than the change in market interest rates in declining interest rate scenarios it is assumed that mortgage portfolios experience higher prepayment rates ire assumes that businesses andor citi treasury make no additional changes in balances or positioning in response to the unanticipated rate changes 

in order to manage changes in interest rates effectively citi may modify pricing on new customer loans and deposits purchase fixed rate securities issue debt that is either fixed or floating or enter into derivative transactions that have the opposite risk exposures citi regularly assesses the viability of 

 

these and other strategies to reduce its interest rate risks and implements such strategies when it believes those actions are prudent 

citi manages interest rate risk as a consolidated companywide position citi’s clientfacing businesses create interestrate sensitive positions including loans and deposits as part of their ongoing activities citi treasury aggregates these risk positions and manages them centrally operating within established limits citi treasury makes positioning decisions and uses tools such as citi’s investment securities portfolio companyissued debt and interest rate derivatives to target the desired risk profile changes in citi’s interest rate risk position reflect the accumulated changes in all nontrading assets and liabilities with potentially large and offsetting impacts as well as citi treasury’s positioning decisions 

citigroup employs additional measurements including stress testing the impact of nonlinear interest rate movements on the value of the balance sheet the analysis of portfolio duration and volatility particularly as they relate to mortgage loans and mortgagebacked securities and the potential impact of the change in the spread between different market indices 

interest rate risk of investment portfolios—impact on aoci 

citi also measures the potential impacts of changes in interest rates on the value of its aoci which can in turn impact citi’s common equity and tangible common equity this will impact citi’s common equity tier 1 and other regulatory capital ratios citi’s goal is to benefit from an increase in the market level of interest rates while limiting the impact of changes in aoci on its regulatory capital position 

aoci at risk is managed as part of the companywide interest rate risk position aoci at risk considers potential changes in aoci and the corresponding impact on the common equity tier 1 capital ratio relative to citi’s capital generation capacity 

the following table sets forth the estimated impact to citi’s net interest revenue aoci and the common equity tier 1 capital ratio on a fully implemented basis each assuming an unanticipated parallel instantaneous 100 basis point increase in interest rates 



 the 2016 increase in the estimated impact to net interest revenue primarily reflected citi treasury actions including interest rate derivative positioning the 2016 decrease in the estimated impact to aoci and the common equity tier 1 capital ratio primarily reflected changes in the composition of citi treasury’s investment and interest rate derivatives portfolio 

in the event of an unanticipated parallel instantaneous 100 basis point increase in interest rates citi expects the negative impact to aoci would be offset in shareholders’ equity through the combination of expected incremental net interest revenue and the expected recovery of the impact on aoci 

 

through accretion of citi’s investment portfolio over a period of time as of december 31 2016  citi expects that the negative 46 billion impact to aoci in such a scenario could potentially be offset over approximately 22 months 

the following table sets forth the estimated impact to citi’s net interest revenue aoci and the common equity tier 1 capital ratio on a fully implemented basis under four different changes in interest rate scenarios for the us dollar and citi’s other currencies while citi also monitors the impact of a parallel decrease in interest rates a 100 basis point decrease in shortterm rates is not meaningful as it would imply negative interest rates in many of citi’s markets 



note each scenario in the table above assumes that the rate change will occur instantaneously changes in interest rates for maturities between the overnight rate and the 10year rate are interpolated 

 as shown in the table above the magnitude of the impact to citi’s net interest revenue and aoci is greater under scenario 2 as compared to scenario 3 this is because the combination of changes to citi’s investment portfolio partially offset by changes related to citi’s pension liabilities results in a net position that is more sensitive to rates at shorter and intermediate term maturities 

over the past year a number of central banks including the european central bank the bank of japan and the swiss national bank have implemented negative interest rates and additional governmental entities could do so in the future 

 

while negative interest rates can adversely impact net interest revenue as well as net interest margin citi has to date been able to partially offset the impact of negative rates in these jurisdictions through a combination of business and citi treasury interest rate risk mitigation activities as discussed including applying negative interest rates to client accounts 

changes in foreign exchange rates—impacts on aoci and capital 

as of december 31 2016  citi estimates that an unanticipated parallel instantaneous 5 appreciation of the us dollar against all of the other currencies in which citi has invested capital could reduce citi’s tangible common equity tce by approximately 15 billion or 09 as a result of changes to citi’s foreign currency translation adjustment in aoci net of hedges this impact would be primarily due to changes in the value of the mexican peso the euro and the australian dollar 

this impact is also before any mitigating actions citi may take including ongoing management of its foreign currency translation exposure specifically as currency movements change the value of citi’s net investments in foreign currencydenominated capital these movements also change the value of citi’s riskweighted assets denominated in those currencies this coupled with citi’s foreign currency hedging strategies such as foreign currency borrowings foreign currency forwards and other currency hedging instruments lessens the impact of foreign currency movements on citi’s common equity tier 1 capital ratio changes in these hedging strategies as well as hedging costs divestitures and tax impacts can further impact the actual impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on citi’s capital as compared to an unanticipated parallel shock as described above 

the effect of citi’s ongoing management strategies with respect to changes in foreign exchange rates and the impact of these changes on citi’s tce and common equity tier 1 capital ratio are shown in the table below for additional information on the changes in aoci see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements 

 



 

interest revenueexpense and net interest margin 



note all interest expense amounts include fdic deposit insurance assessments 

 

citi’s net interest margin nim is calculated by dividing gross interest revenue less gross interest expense by average interest earning assets citi’s nim was 279 in the fourth quarter of 

2016 a decrease of 7 basis points from the third quarter of 2016 driven primarily by lower trading nim higher funding costs and the higher mix of promotional rate balances in the us cards portfolios on a fullyear basis citi’s nim declined to 286 compared to 293 in 2015 driven primarily by the divestiture of onemain financial the impact of fx translation and lower trading nim partially offset by higher loan volumes including from the costco portfolio 

 

as noted in the tables above citi’s interest expense 

includes the impact of fdic deposit insurance assessments 

as part of the doddfrank act the fdic is required to ensure that its deposit insurance fund reserve ratio reaches 135 by september 30 2020 in march 2016 the fdic issued a final rule that imposes on insured depository institutions with at least 10 billion in assets which includes citibank a surcharge of 45 basis points per annum until the fund reaches the required ratio which the fdic estimates would take approximately two years as previously disclosed based on its current assessment base citi estimates the net impact to citibank would be approximately 500 million over the twoyear period beginning in the third quarter of 2016

market risk of trading portfolios 

trading portfolios include positions resulting from market making activities hedges of certain availableforsale afs debt securities the cva relating from derivative counterparties and all associated hedges fair value option loans hedges to the loan portfolio and the leverage finance pipeline within capital markets origination within icg  

the market risk of citi’s trading portfolios is monitored using a combination of quantitative and qualitative measures including but not limited to 

 

each trading portfolio across citi’s businesses has its own market risk limit framework encompassing these measures and other controls including trading mandates permitted product 

 

lists and a new product approval process for complex products 

the following chart of total daily tradingrelated revenue loss captures trading volatility and shows the number of days in which revenues for citi’s trading businesses fell within particular ranges tradingrelated revenue includes trading net interest and other revenue associated with citi’s trading businesses it excludes dva fva and cva adjustments incurred due to changes in the credit quality of counterparties as well as any associated hedges to that cva in addition it excludes fees and other revenue associated with capital markets origination activities tradingrelated revenues are driven by both customer flows and the changes in valuation of the trading inventory as shown in the chart positive tradingrelated revenue was achieved for 99 of the trading days in 2016  



 

factor sensitivities 

factor sensitivities are expressed as the change in the value of a position for a defined change in a market risk factor such as a change in the value of a us treasury bill for a one basis point change in interest rates citi’s market risk management within the risk organization works to ensure that factor sensitivities are calculated monitored and in most cases limited for all material risks taken in the trading portfolios 

value at risk var 

var estimates at a 99 confidence level the potential decline in the value of a position or a portfolio under normal market conditions assuming a oneday holding period var statistics which are based on historical data can be materially different across firms due to differences in portfolio composition differences in var methodologies and differences in model parameters as a result citi believes var statistics can be used more effectively as indicators of trends in risktaking within a firm rather than as a basis for inferring differences in risktaking across firms 

citi uses a single independently approved monte carlo simulation var model see “var model review and validation” below which has been designed to capture material risk sensitivities such as first and secondorder sensitivities of positions to changes in market prices of various asset classesrisk types such as interest rate credit spread foreign exchange equity and commodity risks citi’s var includes positions which are measured at fair value it does not include investment securities classified as afs or htm for information on these securities see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

citi believes its var model is conservatively calibrated to incorporate fattail scaling and the greater of shortterm approximately the most recent month and longterm three years market volatility the monte carlo simulation involves approximately 350000 market factors making use of approximately 200000 time series with sensitivities updated daily volatility parameters updated daily to weekly and correlation parameters updated monthly the conservative features of the var calibration contribute an approximate 25 addon to what would be a var estimated under the assumption of stable and perfectly normally distributed markets 

as set forth in the table below citi’s average trading var decreased from 2015  to 2016  mainly due to changes in interest rate exposures from marktomarket hedging activity against nontrading positions in the markets and securities services businesses within icg  additionally foreign exchange risk declined mainly due to exposure changes throughout 2016 average trading and credit portfolio var also declined with the further decrease driven by reduction in average credit spreads and volatility affecting the credit portfolio and by changes in the hedging related to lending activities in 2016 trading var as of december 31 2016 increased from december 31 2015 mainly due to higher exposures in the municipals and commodities businesses within icg  

yearend and average trading var and trading and credit portfolio var

the table below provides the range of market factor vars associated with citi’s total trading var inclusive of specific risk 



note no covariance adjustment can be inferred from the above table as the high and low for each market factor will be from different close of business dates 

the following table provides the var for icg  excluding the cva relating to derivative counterparties hedges of cva fair value option loans and hedges to the loan portfolio 



var model review and validation 

generally citi’s var review and model validation process entails reviewing the model framework major assumptions and implementation of the mathematical algorithm in addition as part of the model validation process product specific backtesting on portfolios is periodically completed and reviewed with citi’s us banking regulators furthermore regulatory var backtesting as described below is performed against buyandhold profit and loss on a monthly basis for multiple subportfolios across the organization trading desk level icg  business segment and citigroup and the results are shared with us banking regulators 

significant var model and assumption changes must be independently validated within citi’s risk management organization this validation process includes a review by citi’s model validation group and further approval from its model validation review committee which is composed of senior quantitative risk management officers in the event of significant model changes parallel model runs are undertaken prior to implementation in addition significant model and assumption changes are subject to the periodic reviews and approval by citi’s us banking regulators 

citi uses the same independently validated var model for both regulatory var and risk management var ie total trading and total trading and credit portfolios vars and as such the model review and oversight process for both purposes is as described above 

regulatory var which is calculated in accordance with basel iii differs from risk management var due to the fact that certain positions included in risk management var are 

 

not eligible for market risk treatment in regulatory var the composition of risk management var is discussed under “value at risk” above the applicability of the var model for positions eligible for market risk treatment under us regulatory capital rules is periodically reviewed and approved by citi’s us banking regulators 

in accordance with basel iii regulatory var includes all trading bookcovered positions and all foreign exchange and commodity exposures pursuant to basel iii regulatory var excludes positions that fail to meet the intent and ability to trade requirements and are therefore classified as nontrading book and categories of exposures that are specifically excluded as covered positions regulatory var excludes cva on derivative instruments and dva on citi’s own fair value option liabilities cva hedges are excluded from regulatory var and included in credit riskweighted assets as computed under the advanced approaches for determining riskweighted assets 

regulatory var backtesting 

in accordance with basel iii citi is required to perform backtesting to evaluate the effectiveness of its regulatory var model regulatory var backtesting is the process in which the daily oneday var at a 99 confidence interval is compared to the buyandhold profit and loss ie the profit and loss impact if the portfolio is held constant at the end of the day and repriced the following day buyandhold profit and loss represents the daily marktomarket profit and loss attributable to price movements in covered positions from the close of the previous business day buyandhold profit and loss excludes realized trading revenue net interest fees and commissions intraday trading profit and loss and changes in reserves 

based on a 99 confidence level citi would expect two to three days in any one year where buyandhold losses exceeded the regulatory var given the conservative calibration of citi’s var model as a result of taking the greater of short and longterm volatilities and fattail scaling of volatilities citi would expect fewer exceptions under normal and stable market conditions periods of unstable market conditions could increase the number of backtesting exceptions 

the following graph shows the daily buyandhold profit and loss associated with citi’s covered positions compared to citi’s oneday regulatory var during 2016 during 2016 there were two backtesting exceptions observed for citi’s regulatory var as previously disclosed trading losses on june 3 2016 marginally exceeded the var estimate at the citigroup level driven by higher volatility in the interest rate and foreign exchange markets following the release of weak nonfarm payroll data separately trading losses on november 14 2016 exceeded the var estimate at the citigroup level driven by the widening of municipal bond yields following the election results in the united states 

 

the difference between the 41 of days with buyandhold gains for regulatory var backtesting and the 99 of days with trading net interest and other revenue associated with citi’s trading businesses shown in the histogram of daily tradingrelated revenue below reflects among other things that a significant portion of citi’s tradingrelated revenue is not generated from daily price movements on these positions and exposures as well as differences in the portfolio composition of regulatory var and risk management var 



 

stress testing 

citi performs stress testing on a regular basis to estimate the impact of extreme market movements it is performed on individual positions and trading portfolios as well as in aggregate inclusive of multiple trading portfolios citi’s market risk management after consultations with the businesses develops both systemic and specific stress scenarios reviews the output of periodic stress testing exercises and uses the information to assess the ongoing appropriateness of exposure levels and limits citi uses two complementary approaches to market risk stress testing across all major risk factors ie equity foreign exchange commodity interest rate and credit spreads topdown systemic stresses and bottomup businessspecific stresses systemic stresses are designed to quantify the potential impact of extreme market movements on an institutionwide basis and are constructed using both historical periods of market stress and projections of adverse economic scenarios businessspecific stresses are designed to probe the risks of particular portfolios and market segments especially those risks that are not fully captured in var and systemic stresses 

the systemic stress scenarios and businessspecific stress scenarios at citi are used in several reports reviewed by senior management and also to calculate internal risk capital for trading market risk in general changes in market factors are defined over a oneyear horizon however for the purpose of calculating internal risk capital changes in a very limited number of the most liquid market factors are defined over a shorter twomonth horizon the limited set of market factors subject to the shorter twomonth time horizon are those that in management’s judgment have historically remained very liquid during financial crises even as the trading liquidity of most other market factors materially decreased 

operational risk 

overview 

operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes systems or human factors or from external events it includes risk of failing to comply with applicable laws and regulations but excludes strategic risk operational risk includes the reputation and franchise risk associated with business practices or market conduct in which citi is involved as well as compliance conduct and legal risks 

operational risk is inherent in citi’s global business activities as well as related support processes and can result in losses arising from events associated with the following among others 

 

citi manages operational risk consistent with the overall framework described in “managing global risk—overview” above the company’s goal is to keep operational risk at appropriate levels relative to the characteristics of citi’s businesses the markets in which it operates its capital and liquidity and the competitive economic and regulatory environment 

to anticipate mitigate and control operational risk citi has established policies and a global framework for assessing monitoring and communicating operational risks and the overall operating effectiveness of the internal control environment across citigroup as part of this framework citi has established a manager’s control assessment mca process a process through which managers at citi identify monitor measure report on and manage risks and the related controls to help managers selfassess significant operational risks and key controls and identify and address weaknesses in the design andor operating effectiveness of internal controls that mitigate significant operational risks 

each major business segment must implement an operational risk process consistent with the requirements of this framework the process for operational risk management includes the following steps 

 

as new products and business activities are developed processes are designed modified or sourced through alternative means and operational risks are considered 

 

an operational risk management committee has been established to provide oversight for operational risk across citigroup and to provide a forum to assess citi’s operational risk profile and ensure actions are taken so that citi’s operational risk exposure is actively managed consistent with citi’s risk appetite the committee seeks to ensure that these actions address the root causes that persistently lead to operational risk losses and create lasting solutions to minimize these losses members include citi’s chief risk officer and citi’s head of operational risk and senior members of their organizations these members cover multiple dimensions of risk management and include business and regional chief risk officers and senior operational risk managers 

in addition risk management including operational risk management works proactively with the businesses and other independent control functions to embed a strong operational risk management culture and framework across citi operational risk management engages with the businesses to ensure effective implementation of the operational risk management framework by focusing on i identification analysis and assessment of operational risks ii effective challenge of key control issues and operational risks and iii anticipation and mitigation of operational risk events 

information about the businesses’ operational risk historical operational risk losses and the control environment is reported by each major business segment and functional area the information is summarized and reported to senior management as well as to the audit committee of citi’s board of directors 

operational risk is measured and assessed through risk capital projected operational risk losses under stress scenarios are also required as part of the federal reserve board’s ccar process 

compliance risk 

compliance risk appetite framework 

citi’s risk appetite framework outlines citi’s compliance risk appetite how citi manages its adherence to its compliance risk appetite and how citi evaluates the effectiveness of its controls for managing compliance risks this framework is executed through 



and maintenance processes product development processes transaction and communication surveillance processes conduct and culturerelated programs monitoring regulatory changes new products services and complex transactions approval processes and training at citi it is the responsibility of each employee to escalate breaches of the compliance risk appetite in a timely manner 

 

compliance program 

compliance aims to operate citi’s compliance risk appetite— and thus minimize mitigate or manage compliance risks— through citi’s compliance program to achieve this mission compliance seeks to 



 

 

conduct risk 

citi manages its exposure to conduct risk through the three lines of defense as discussed above each employee in each line of defense is guided by citi’s mission and value proposition and the principle of responsible finance citi’s leadership standards which are aligned with citi’s mission and value proposition outline citi’s expectations of employees’ behavior and employees’ performance is evaluated against those standards citi’s businesses and functions are responsible for managing their conduct risks compliance advises citi’s businesses and other functions on conduct risks and associated controls internal audit among other work assesses the adequacy and effectiveness of citi’s management of and controls for conduct risk 

citi uses business selfassessment and control function assessments to assess the design and operation of controls that are utilized to manage the institution’s conduct risks citi also manages its conduct risk through other initiatives including various culturerelated efforts 

legal risk 

citi views legal risk as qualitative in nature because it does not lend itself to an appetite expressed through a numerical limit and it cannot be reliably estimated or measured based on forecasts as such citi seeks to manage this risk in accordance with its qualitative risk appetite principle which generally states that activities in which citi engages and the risks those activities generate must be consistent with citi’s underlying commitment to the principle of responsible finance and managed with a goal to eliminate minimize or mitigate this risk as practicable to accomplish this goal legal risk is managed in accordance with the overall framework described in greater detail in “managing global risk—overview” above 

reputational risk 

citi’s reputation is a vital asset in building trust with its stakeholders and citi is diligent in communicating its corporate values including the importance of protecting citi’s reputation to its employees customers and investors the responsibility for maintaining citi’s reputation is shared by all employees who are guided by citi’s code of conduct employees are expected to exercise sound judgment and common sense in every action they take and issues that present potential franchise reputational andor systemic risks are to be appropriately escalated the business practices committees for each of citi’s businesses and regions are part of the governance infrastructure citi has in place to properly review business activities sales practices product design perceived conflicts of interest and other potential franchise or reputational risks that arise in these businesses and regions these committees may also raise potential franchise reputational or systemic risks for due consideration by the business practices committee at the corporate level all of these committees which are composed of citi’s most senior executives provide the guidance necessary for citi’s business practices to meet the highest standards of professionalism integrity and ethical behavior consistent with citi’s mission and value proposition 

strategic risk 

citi senior management led by citi’s ceo is responsible for the development and execution of the strategy of the firm significant strategic actions are reviewed and approved by or notified to the citigroup and citibank boards as appropriate the citigroup board holds an annual strategic meeting and annual regional strategic meetings and receives business presentations at its regular meetings in order to monitor management’s execution of citi’s strategy at the business level business heads are accountable for the interpretation and execution of the firmwide strategy as it applies to their area including decisions on new business and product entries 

the management of strategic risk rests upon the foundational elements that include an annual financial operating plan encompassing all businesses products and geographies and defined financial and operating targets derived from the operating plan which can be monitored throughout the year in order to assess strategic and operating performance strategic risk is monitored through various 

 

mechanisms including regular updates to senior management and the board on performance against the operating plan quarterly business reviews between the citi ceo and business and regional ceos where the performance and risks of each major business and region are discussed ongoing reporting to senior management and executive management scorecards 

country risk 

top 25 country exposures 

the following table presents citi’s top 25 exposures by 

country excluding the us as of december 31 2016 for 

purposes of the table loan amounts are reflected in the country 

where the loan is booked which is generally based on the 

domicile of the borrower for example a loan to a chinese 

subsidiary of a switzerlandbased corporation will generally 

be categorized as a loan in china in addition citi has 

developed regional booking centers in certain countries most 

significantly in the united kingdom uk and ireland in 

order to more efficiently serve its corporate customers as an 

example with respect to the uk only 23 of corporate 

loans presented in the table below are to uk domiciled 

 

entities 25 for unfunded commitments with the balance of 

the loans predominately to european domiciled counterparties 

approximately 80 of the total uk funded loans and 88 of the total uk unfunded commitments were investment grade as of december 31 2016 trading account assets and investment securities are generally categorized based on the domicile of the issuer of the security of the underlying reference entity for additional information on the assets included in the table see the footnotes to the table below 

for a discussion of uncertainties arising as a result of the vote in the uk to withdraw from the eu see “risk factors—strategic risks” above 

  





   

argentina 

as of december 31 2016 citi’s net investment in its argentine operations was approximately 725 million compared to 747 million at december 31 2015 

citi uses the argentine peso as the functional currency in argentina and translates its financial statements into us dollars using the official exchange rate as published by the central bank of argentina the impact of devaluations of the argentine peso on citi’s net investment in argentina net of hedges is reported as a translation loss in stockholders’ equity  

although citi currently uses the argentine peso as the functional currency an increase in inflation resulting in a cumulative threeyear inflation rate of 100 or more would result in a change in the functional currency to the us dollar citi has historically based its evaluation of the cumulative threeyear inflation rate on the cpi consumer price index inflation statistics published by indec the argentine government’s statistics agency however for the period from november 2015 to april 2016 indec did not publish cpi statistics which has led to uncertainty about the cumulative threeyear inflation rates as of december 31 2016 citi evaluated the available cpi statistics as well as inflation statistics published by the argentine central bank and concluded that argentina’s cumulative threeyear inflation rate had not reached 100 however uncertainty continues as to the cumulative threeyear inflation rate and additional information received in future periods could result in a change of functional currency to the us dollar in 2017 

while a change in the functional currency to the us dollar would not result in any immediate gains or losses to citi it would result in future changes in the argentine peso to us dollar exchange rate being recorded in earnings for citi’s argentine pesodenominated assets and liabilities instead of stockholder’s equity 

 

ffiec—crossborder claims on third parties and local country assets 

citi’s crossborder disclosures are based on the country exposure bank regulatory reporting guidelines of the federal financial institutions examination council ffiec the following summarizes some of the ffiec key reporting guidelines 

 

given the requirements noted above citi’s ffiec crossborder exposures and total outstandings tend to fluctuate in some cases significantly from period to period as an example because total outstandings under ffiec guidelines do not include the benefit of margin or hedges market volatility in interest rates foreign exchange rates and credit spreads may cause significant fluctuations in the level of total outstandings all else being equal 

the tables below set forth each country whose total outstandings exceeded 075 of total citigroup assets 







 

significant accounting policies and significant estimates 

note 1  to the consolidated financial statements contains a summary of citigroup’s significant accounting policies including a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements these policies as well as estimates made by management are integral to the presentation of citi’s results of operations and financial condition while all of these policies require a certain level of management judgment and estimates this section highlights and discusses the significant accounting policies that require management to make highly difficult complex or subjective judgments and estimates at times regarding matters that are inherently uncertain and susceptible to change see also “risk factors—operational risks” above management has discussed each of these significant accounting policies the related estimates and its judgments with the audit committee of the citigroup board of directors 

valuations of financial instruments 

citigroup holds debt and equity securities derivatives retained interests in securitizations investments in private equity and other financial instruments substantially all of 

these assets and liabilities are reflected at fair value on citi’s 

consolidated balance sheet 

citi purchases securities under agreements to 

resell reverse repos and sells securities under agreements 

to repurchase repos a majority of which are carried at 

fair value in addition certain loans shortterm borrowings 

longterm debt and deposits as well as certain securities 

borrowed and loaned positions that are collateralized with 

cash are carried at fair value citigroup holds its investments 

trading assets and liabilities and resale and repurchase 

agreements on the consolidated balance sheet to meet 

customer needs and to manage liquidity needs interest rate risks and private equity investing 

when available citi generally uses quoted market prices to determine fair value and classifies such items within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy established under asc 82010  fair value measurement  if quoted market prices are not available fair value is based upon internally developed valuation models that use where possible current marketbased or independently sourced market parameters such as interest rates currency rates and option volatilities such models are often based on a discounted cash flow analysis in addition items valued using such internally generated valuation techniques are classified according to the lowest level input or value driver that is significant to the valuation thus an item may be classified under the fair value hierarchy as level 3 even though there may be some significant inputs that are readily observable 

citi is required to exercise subjective judgments relating to the applicability and functionality of internal valuation models the significance of inputs or value drivers to the valuation of an instrument and the degree of illiquidity and subsequent lack of observability in certain markets these judgments have the potential to impact the company’s financial performance for instruments where the changes in 

 

fair value are recognized in either the consolidated statement of income or in aoci 

moreover for certain investments decreases in fair value are only recognized in earnings in the consolidated statement of income if such decreases are judged to be an otherthantemporary impairment otti adjudicating the temporary nature of fair value impairments is also inherently judgmental 

 the fair value of financial instruments incorporates the effects of citi’s own credit risk and the market view of counterparty credit risk the quantification of which is also complex and judgmental for additional information on citi’s fair value analysis see notes 1 6 24 and 25 to the consolidated financial statements 

allowance for credit losses 

management provides reserves for an estimate of probable losses inherent in the funded loan portfolio and in unfunded loan commitments and standby letters of credit on the consolidated balance sheet in the allowance for loan losses  and in  other liabilities  respectively 

estimates of these probable losses are based upon i citigroup’s internal system of creditrisk ratings that are analogous to the risk ratings of the major credit rating agencies and ii historical default and loss data including rating agency information regarding default rates from 1983 to 2015 and internal data dating to the early 1970s on severity of losses in the event of default adjustments may be made to this data including i statistically calculated estimates to cover the historical fluctuation of the default rates over the credit cycle the historical variability of loss severity among defaulted loans and the degree to which there are large obligor concentrations in the global portfolio and ii adjustments made for specifically known items such as current environmental factors and credit trends 

in addition representatives from both the risk management and finance staffs who cover business areas with delinquencymanaged portfolios containing smaller balance homogeneous loans present their recommended reserve balances based upon leading credit indicators including loan delinquencies and changes in portfolio size as well as economic trends including housing prices unemployment and gdp this methodology is applied separately for each individual product within each geographic region in which these portfolios exist 

this evaluation process is subject to numerous estimates and judgments the frequency of default risk ratings loss recovery rates the size and diversity of individual large credits and the ability of borrowers with foreign currency obligations to obtain the foreign currency necessary for orderly debt servicing among other things are all taken into account during this review changes in these estimates could have a direct impact on citi’s credit costs and the allowance in any period 

for a further description of the loan loss reserve and related accounts see notes 1 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements 

goodwill 

citi tests goodwill for impairment annually on july 1 the annual test and between annual tests the interim test if an event occurs or circumstances change that would morelikelythannot reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount such as a significant adverse change in the business climate a decision to sell or dispose of all or a significant portion of a reporting unit or a significant decline in citi’s stock price during 2016 annual and interim tests were performed which resulted in no goodwill impairment as described in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

as of december 31 2016  citigroup consists of the following business segments global consumer banking  institutional clients group  and citi holdings goodwill impairment testing is performed at the level below the business segment referred to as a reporting unit goodwill is recorded in a business combination under the acquisition method of accounting when the acquisition price is higher than the fair value of net assets including identifiable intangible assets at the time a business is acquired goodwill is allocated to citi’s applicable reporting units based on relative fair value once goodwill has been allocated to the reporting units it generally no longer retains its identification with a particular acquisition but instead becomes identified with the reporting unit as a whole as a result all of the fair value of each reporting unit is available to support the allocated goodwill if any significant business reorganization occurs citi may reallocate the goodwill 

consistent with prior years citi utilizes allocated equity as a proxy for the carrying value of its reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing the allocated equity in the reporting units is determined based on the capital the business would require if it were operating as a standalone entity incorporating sufficient capital to be in compliance with regulatory capital requirements including capital for specifically identified goodwill and intangible assets the capital allocated to the businesses is incorporated into the annual budget process which is reviewed by citi’s board of directors 

       goodwill impairment testing involves management judgment requiring an assessment of whether the carrying value of the reporting unit can be supported by the fair value of the reporting unit using widely accepted valuation techniques such as the market approach earnings multiples andor transaction multiples andor the income approach discounted cash flow dcf method in applying these methodologies citi utilizes a number of factors including actual operating results future business plans economic projections and market data 

      similar to 2015 citigroup engaged an independent valuation specialist in 2016 to assist in citi’s valuation for most of the reporting units employing both the market approach and the dcf method for reporting units where both methods were utilized in 2016 the resulting fair values were relatively consistent and appropriate weighting was given to outputs from both methods 

the dcf method utilized at the time of each impairment test used discount rates that citi believes adequately reflected the risk and uncertainty in the financial markets in the 

 

internally generated cash flow projections the dcf method employs a capital asset pricing model in estimating the discount rate citi continues to value the remaining reporting units where it believes the risk of impairment to be low using primarily the market approach 

since none of the company’s reporting units are publicly traded individual reporting unit fairvalue determinations cannot be directly correlated to citigroup’s common stock price the sum of the fair values of the reporting units at july 1 2016 exceeded the overall market capitalization of citi as of july 1 2016 however citi believes that it is not meaningful to reconcile the sum of the fair values of the company’s reporting units to its market capitalization due to several factors the market capitalization of citigroup reflects the execution risk in a transaction involving citigroup due to its size however the individual reporting units’ fair values are not subject to the same level of execution risk nor a business model that is perceived to be as complex in addition the market capitalization of citigroup does not include consideration of the individual reporting unit’s control premium 

        see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on goodwill including the changes in the goodwill balance yearoveryear and the reporting unit goodwill balances as of december 31 2016  

income taxes 

overview 

citi is subject to the income tax laws of the us its states and local municipalities and the foreign jurisdictions in which citi operates these tax laws are complex and are subject to differing interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be subject to review and adjudication by the court systems of the various tax jurisdictions or may be settled with the taxing authority upon audit 

in establishing a provision for income tax expense citi must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws citi must also make estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions both domestic and foreign deferred taxes are recorded for the future consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns based upon enacted tax laws and rates deferred tax assets dtas are recognized subject to management’s judgment that realization is morelikelythannot 

dtas 

at december 31 2016 citi had recorded net dtas of 467 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016 citi’s dtas increased by 12 billion driven by movements in aoci partially offset by earnings on a fullyear basis citi’s dtas decreased 12 billion from 478 billion at december 31 2015 the decrease in total dtas yearoveryear was primarily due to earnings partially offset by an increase in aoci 

foreign tax credits ftcs comprised approximately 142 billion of citi’s dtas as of december 31 2016 

compared to approximately 159 billion as of december 31 2015 the decrease in ftcs yearoveryear was due to the generation of us taxable income and represented 17 billion of the 12 billion decrease in citi’s overall dtas noted above offset by the increase in the aocirelated dtas the ftcs carryforward periods represent the most timesensitive component of citi’s dtas accordingly in 2017 citi will continue to prioritize reducing the ftc carryforward component of the dtas secondarily citi’s actions will focus on reducing other dta components and thereby reduce the total dtas citi’s dtas will decline primarily as additional domestic gaap taxable income is generated 

while citi’s net total dtas decreased yearoveryear the time remaining for utilization has shortened given the passage of time particularly with respect to the ftcs component of the dtas although realization is not assured citi believes that the realization of the recognized net dtas of 467 billion at december 31 2016 is morelikelythannot based upon management’s expectations as to future taxable income in the jurisdictions in which the dtas arise as well as available tax planning strategies as defined in asc 740 income taxes  that would be implemented if necessary to prevent a carryforward from expiring 

citi has concluded that it has the necessary positive evidence to support the full realization of its dtas specifically citi forecasts sufficient us taxable income in the carryforward periods exclusive of asc 740 tax planning strategies citi’s forecasted taxable income which will continue to be subject to overall market and global economic conditions incorporates geographic business forecasts and taxable income adjustments to those forecasts eg us tax exempt income loan loss reserves deductible for us tax reporting in subsequent years and actions intended to optimize its us taxable earnings in general citi would need to generate approximately 57 billion of us taxable income during the ftcs carryforward periods to prevent citi’s ftcs from expiring unutilized 

in addition to its forecasted us taxable income citi has tax planning strategies available to it under asc 740 that would be implemented if necessary to prevent a carryforward from expiring unutilized these strategies include i repatriating lowtaxed foreign source earnings for which an assertion that the earnings have been indefinitely reinvested has not been made ii accelerating us taxable income into or deferring us tax deductions out of the latter years of the carryforward period eg selling appreciated assets electing straightline depreciation iii accelerating deductible temporary differences outside the us and iv selling certain assets that produce taxexempt income while purchasing assets that produce fully taxable income in addition the sale or restructuring of certain businesses can produce significant us taxable income within the relevant carryforward periods 

based upon the foregoing discussion citi believes the us federal and new york state and city net operating loss carryforward period of 20 years provides enough time to fully utilize the dtas pertaining to the existing net operating loss carryforwards and any net operating loss that would be created by the reversal of the future net deductions that have not yet been taken on a tax return 

 

with respect to the ftcs component of the dtas the carryforward period is 10 years citi believes that it will generate sufficient us taxable income within the 10year carryforward period to be able to fully utilize the ftcs in addition to any ftcs produced in such period which must be used prior to any carryforward utilization

expiration dates of the ftcs see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the potential impact to citi’s dtas that could arise from us corporate tax reform see “risk factors—strategic risks” above

accounting changes and future application of accounting standards 

see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of “accounting changes” and the “future application of accounting standards” 

disclosure controls and procedures 

citi’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms including without limitation that information required to be disclosed by citi in its sec filings is accumulated and communicated to management including the chief executive officer ceo and chief financial officer cfo as appropriate to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

citi’s disclosure committee assists the ceo and cfo in their responsibilities to design establish maintain and evaluate the effectiveness of citi’s disclosure controls and procedures the disclosure committee is responsible for among other things the oversight maintenance and implementation of the disclosure controls and procedures subject to the supervision and oversight of the ceo and cfo 

citi’s management with the participation of its ceo and cfo has evaluated the effectiveness of citigroup’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as of december 31 2016  and based on that evaluation the ceo and cfo have concluded that at that date citigroup’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective 

  

management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting 

citi’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting citi’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of its financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles citi’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of citi’s assets ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that citi’s receipts and expenditures are made only in accordance with authorizations of citi’s management and directors and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of citi’s assets that could have a material effect on its financial statements 

 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate in addition given citi’s large size complex operations and global footprint lapses or deficiencies in internal controls may occur from time to time 

citi’s management assessed the effectiveness of citigroup’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2016  based on the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in  internal controlintegrated framework 2013  based on this assessment management believes that as of december 31 2016  citi’s internal control over financial reporting was effective in addition there were no changes in citi’s internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended december 31 2016  that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect citi’s internal control over financial reporting 

the effectiveness of citi’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2016  has been audited by kpmg llp citi’s independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report below which expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of citi’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2016

certain reclassifications have been made to the prior periods’ financial statements and notes to conform to the current period’s presentation 

principles of consolidation 

the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of citigroup and its subsidiaries prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap the company consolidates subsidiaries in which it holds directly or indirectly more than 50 of the voting rights or where it exercises control entities where the company holds 20 to 50 of the voting rights andor has the ability to exercise significant influence other than investments of designated venture capital subsidiaries or investments accounted for at fair value under the fair value option are accounted for under the equity method and the pro rata share of their income loss is included in other revenue  income from investments in lessthan 20 owned companies is recognized when dividends are received as discussed in more detail in note 21 to the consolidated financial statements citigroup also consolidates entities deemed to be variable interest entities when citigroup is determined to be the primary beneficiary gains and losses on the disposition of branches subsidiaries affiliates buildings and other investments are included in other revenue  

citibank 

citibank na citibank is a commercial bank and wholly owned subsidiary of citigroup citibank’s principal offerings include consumer finance mortgage lending and retail banking including commercial banking products and services investment banking cash management and trade finance and private banking products and services 

variable interest entities 

an entity is a variable interest entity vie if it meets the criteria outlined in accounting standards codification asc topic 810 consolidation  which are i the entity has equity that is insufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties or ii the entity has equity investors that cannot make significant decisions about the entity’s operations or that do not absorb their proportionate share of the entity’s expected losses or expected returns 

the company consolidates a vie when it has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the vie’s economic performance and a right to receive benefits or the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could be potentially significant to the vie that is citi is the primary beneficiary in addition to variable interests held in 

 

consolidated vies the company has variable interests in other vies that are not consolidated because the company is not the primary beneficiary 

however these vies and all other unconsolidated vies are monitored by the company to assess whether any events have occurred to cause its primary beneficiary status to change 

all other entities not deemed to be vies with which the company has involvement are evaluated for consolidation under other subtopics of asc 810 see note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for more detailed information 

foreign currency translation 

assets and liabilities of citi’s foreign operations are translated from their respective functional currencies into us dollars using periodend spot foreign exchange rates the effects of those translation adjustments are reported in  accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a component of stockholders’ equity along with any related hedge and tax effects until realized upon sale or substantial liquidation of the foreign operation revenues and expenses of citi’s foreign operations are translated monthly from their respective functional currencies into us dollars at amounts that approximate weighted average exchange rates 

for transactions that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency including transactions denominated in the local currencies of foreign operations with the us dollar as their functional currency the effects of changes in exchange rates are primarily included in principal transactions  along with the related effects of any economic hedges instruments used to hedge foreign currency exposures include foreign currency forward option and swap contracts and in certain instances designated issues of nonus dollar debt foreign operations in countries with highly inflationary economies designate the us dollar as their functional currency with the effects of changes in exchange rates primarily included in other revenue

physical commodities inventory is carried at the lower of cost or market with related losses reported in principal transactions  realized gains and losses on sales of commodities inventory are included in principal transactions  investments in unallocated precious metals accounts gold silver platinum and palladium are accounted for as hybrid instruments containing a debt host 

 

contract and an embedded nonfinancial derivative instrument indexed to the price of the relevant precious metal the embedded derivative instrument is separated from the debt host contract and accounted for at fair value the debt host contract is accounted for at fair value under the fair value option as described in note 26 to the consolidated financial statements 

derivatives used for trading purposes include interest rate currency equity credit and commodity swap agreements options caps and floors warrants and financial and commodity futures and forward contracts derivative asset and liability positions are presented net by counterparty on the consolidated balance sheet when a valid master netting agreement exists and the other conditions set out in asc 21020 balance sheet—offsetting  are met see note 22 to the consolidated financial statements 

the company uses a number of techniques to determine the fair value of trading assets and liabilities which are described in note 24 to the consolidated financial statements 

securities borrowed and securities loaned 

securities borrowing and lending transactions do not constitute a sale of the underlying securities for accounting purposes and are treated as collateralized financing transactions such transactions are recorded at the amount of proceeds advanced or received plus accrued interest as described in note 25 to the consolidated financial statements the company has elected to apply fair value accounting to a number of securities borrowing and lending transactions fees paid or received for all securities lending and borrowing transactions are recorded in interest expense or interest revenue  at the contractually specified rate 

the company monitors the fair value of securities borrowed or loaned on a daily basis and obtains or posts additional collateral in order to maintain contractual margin protection 

as described in note 24 to the consolidated financial statements the company uses a discounted cash flow technique to determine the fair value of securities lending and borrowing transactions 

repurchase and resale agreements 

securities sold under agreements to repurchase repos and securities purchased under agreements to resell reverse repos do not constitute a sale or purchase of the underlying securities for accounting purposes and are treated as collateralized financing transactions as described in note 25 to the consolidated financial statements the company has elected to apply fair value accounting to the majority of such transactions with changes in fair value reported in earnings any transactions for which fair value accounting has not been elected are recorded at the amount of cash advanced or received plus accrued interest irrespective of whether the company has elected fair value accounting interest paid or received on all repo and reverse repo transactions is recorded in interest expense  or interest revenue  at the contractually specified rate

as described in note 24 to the consolidated financial statements the company uses a discounted cash flow technique to determine the fair value of repo and reverse repo transactions 

loans 

loans are reported at their outstanding principal balances net of any unearned income and unamortized deferred fees and costs except that credit card receivable balances also include accrued interest and fees loan origination fees and certain direct origination costs are generally deferred and recognized as adjustments to income over the lives of the related loans 

as described in note 25 to the consolidated financial statements citi has elected fair value accounting for certain loans such loans are carried at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings interest income on such loans is recorded in interest revenue  at the contractually specified rate 

loans that are heldforinvestment are classified as loans net of unearned income  on the consolidated balance sheet and the related cash flows are included within the cash flows from investing activities category in the consolidated statement of cash flows on the line change in loans  however when the initial intent for holding a loan has changed from heldforinvestment to heldforsale the loan is reclassified to heldforsale but the related cash flows continue to be reported in cash flows from investing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows on the line proceeds from sales and securitizations of loans  

consumer loans 

consumer loans represent loans and leases managed primarily by the  global consumer banking gcb  businesses and citi holdings 

consumer nonaccrual and reaging policies 

as a general rule interest accrual ceases for installment and real estate both open and closedend loans when payments are 90 days  contractually past due for credit cards and other unsecured revolving loans however citi generally accrues interest until payments are 180 days  past due as a result of occ guidance home equity loans in regulated bank entities are classified as nonaccrual if the related residential first mortgage is 90 days  or more past due also as a result of occ guidance mortgage loans in regulated bank entities discharged through chapter 7 bankruptcy other than fhainsured loans are classified as nonaccrual commercial market loans are placed on a cash nonaccrual basis when 

 

it is determined based on actual experience and a forwardlooking assessment of the collectability of the loan in full that the payment of interest or principal is doubtful or when interest or principal is 90 days  past due 

loans that have been modified to grant a concession to a borrower in financial difficulty may not be accruing interest at the time of the modification the policy for returning such modified loans to accrual status varies by product andor region in most cases a minimum number of payments ranging from one  to six  is required while in other cases the loan is never returned to accrual status for regulated bank entities such modified loans are returned to accrual status if a credit evaluation at the time of or subsequent to the modification indicates the borrower is able to meet the restructured terms and the borrower is current and has demonstrated a reasonable period of sustained payment performance minimum six months  of consecutive payments 

for us consumer loans generally one of the conditions to qualify for modification is that a minimum number of payments typically ranging from one  to three  must be made upon modification the loan is reaged to current status however reaging practices for certain openended consumer loans such as credit cards are governed by federal financial institutions examination council ffiec guidelines for openended consumer loans subject to ffiec guidelines one of the conditions for the loan to be reaged to current status is that at least three  consecutive minimum monthly payments or the equivalent amount must be received in addition under ffiec guidelines the number of times that such a loan can be reaged is subject to limitations generally once in 12 months and twice in five years furthermore federal housing administration fha and department of veterans affairs va loans may only be modified under those respective agencies’ guidelines and payments are not always required in order to reage a modified loan to current 

consumer chargeoff policies 

citi’s chargeoff policies follow the general guidelines below 



360 days  contractually past due if a decision has been made not to foreclose on the loans 

 

corporate loans 

corporate loans represent loans and leases managed by institutional clients group icg  corporate loans are identified as impaired and placed on a cash nonaccrual basis when it is determined based on actual experience and a forwardlooking assessment of the collectability of the loan in full that the payment of interest or principal is doubtful or when interest or principal is 90 days  past due except when the loan is well collateralized and in the process of collection any interest accrued on impaired corporate loans and leases is reversed at 90 days  past due and charged against current earnings and interest is thereafter included in earnings only to the extent actually received in cash when there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectability of principal all cash receipts are thereafter applied to reduce the recorded investment in the loan 

impaired corporate loans and leases are written down to the extent that principal is deemed to be uncollectable impaired collateraldependent loans and leases where repayment is expected to be provided solely by the sale of the underlying collateral and there are no other available and reliable sources of repayment are written down to the lower of cost or collateral value cashbasis loans are returned to accrual status when all contractual principal and interest 

 

amounts are reasonably assured of repayment and there is a sustained period of repayment performance in accordance with the contractual terms 

loans heldforsale 

corporate and consumer loans that have been identified for sale are classified as loans heldforsale and included in other assets  the practice of citi’s us prime mortgage business has been to sell substantially all of its conforming loans as such us prime mortgage conforming loans are classified as heldforsale and the fair value option is elected at origination with changes in fair value recorded in other revenue  with the exception of those loans for which the fair value option has been elected heldforsale loans are accounted for at the lower of cost or market value with any writedowns or subsequent recoveries charged to other revenue  the related cash flows are classified in the consolidated statement of cash flows in the cash flows from operating activities category on the line change in loans heldforsale  

allowance for loan losses 

allowance for loan losses represents management’s best estimate of probable losses inherent in the portfolio including probable losses related to large individually evaluated impaired loans and troubled debt restructurings attribution of the allowance is made for analytical purposes only and the entire allowance is available to absorb probable loan losses inherent in the overall portfolio additions to the allowance are made through the provision for loan losses  loan losses are deducted from the allowance and subsequent recoveries are added assets received in exchange for loan claims in a restructuring are initially recorded at fair value with any gain or loss reflected as a recovery or chargeoff to the provision 

consumer loans 

for consumer loans each portfolio of nonmodified smallerbalance homogeneous loans is independently evaluated for impairment by product type eg residential mortgage credit card etc in accordance with asc 450 contingencies  the allowance for loan losses attributed to these loans is established via a process that estimates the probable losses inherent in the specific portfolio this process includes migration analysis in which historical delinquency and credit loss experience is applied to the current aging of the portfolio together with analyses that reflect current and anticipated economic conditions including changes in housing prices and unemployment trends citi’s allowance for loan losses under asc 450 only considers contractual principal amounts due except for credit card loans where estimated loss amounts related to accrued interest receivable are also included 

management also considers overall portfolio indicators including historical credit losses delinquent nonperforming and classified loans trends in volumes and terms of loans an evaluation of overall credit quality the credit process including lending policies and procedures and economic geographical product and other environmental factors 

separate valuation allowances are determined for impaired smallerbalance homogeneous loans whose terms have been modified in a troubled debt restructuring tdr longterm modification programs and shortterm less than 12 months modifications that provide concessions such as interest rate reductions to borrowers in financial difficulty are reported as tdrs in addition loan modifications that involve a trial period are reported as tdrs at the start of the trial period the allowance for loan losses for tdrs is determined in accordance with asc 3101035 receivables—subsequent measurement  formerly sfas 114 considering all available evidence including as appropriate the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s original contractual effective rate the secondary market value of the loan and the fair value of collateral less disposal costs these expected cash flows incorporate modification program default rate assumptions the original contractual effective rate for credit card loans is the premodification rate which may include interest rate increases under the original contractual agreement with the borrower 

valuation allowances for commercial market loans which are classifiably managed consumer loans are determined in the same manner as for corporate loans and are described in more detail in the following section generally an assetspecific component is calculated under asc 3101035 on an individual basis for largerbalance nonhomogeneous loans that are considered impaired and the allowance for the remainder of the classifiably managed consumer loan portfolio is calculated under asc 450 using a statistical methodology that may be supplemented by management adjustment 

corporate loans 

in the corporate portfolios the allowance for loan losses  includes an assetspecific component and a statistically based component the assetspecific component is calculated under asc 3101035 on an individual basis for largerbalance nonhomogeneous loans which are considered impaired an assetspecific allowance is established when the discounted cash flows collateral value less disposal costs or observable market price of the impaired loan are lower than its carrying value this allowance considers the borrower’s overall financial condition resources and payment record the prospects for support from any financially responsible guarantors discussed further below and if appropriate the realizable value of any collateral the assetspecific component of the allowance for smaller balance impaired loans is calculated on a pool basis considering historical loss experience 

the allowance for the remainder of the loan portfolio is determined under asc 450 using a statistical methodology supplemented by management judgment the statistical analysis considers the portfolio’s size remaining tenor and credit quality as measured by internal risk ratings assigned to individual credit facilities which reflect probability of default and loss given default the statistical analysis considers historical default rates and historical loss severity in the event of default including historical average levels 

 

and historical variability the result is an estimated range for inherent losses the best estimate within the range is then determined by management’s quantitative and qualitative assessment of current conditions including general economic conditions specific industry and geographic trends and internal factors including portfolio concentrations trends in internal credit quality indicators and current and past underwriting standards 

for both the assetspecific and the statistically based components of the allowance for loan losses  management may incorporate guarantor support the financial wherewithal of the guarantor is evaluated as applicable based on net worth cash flow statements and personal or company financial statements which are updated and reviewed at least annually citi seeks performance on guarantee arrangements in the normal course of business seeking performance entails obtaining satisfactory cooperation from the guarantor or borrower in the specific situation this regular cooperation is indicative of pursuit and successful enforcement of the guarantee the exposure is reduced without the expense and burden of pursuing a legal remedy a guarantor’s reputation and willingness to work with citigroup is evaluated based on the historical experience with the guarantor and the knowledge of the marketplace in the rare event that the guarantor is unwilling or unable to perform or facilitate borrower cooperation citi pursues a legal remedy however enforcing a guarantee via legal action against the guarantor is not the primary means of resolving a troubled loan situation and rarely occurs if citi does not pursue a legal remedy it is because citi does not believe that the guarantor has the financial wherewithal to perform regardless of legal action or because there are legal limitations on simultaneously pursuing guarantors and foreclosure a guarantor’s reputation does not impact citi’s decision or ability to seek performance under the guarantee 

in cases where a guarantee is a factor in the assessment of loan losses it is included via adjustment to the loan’s internal risk rating which in turn is the basis for the adjustment to the statistically based component of the allowance for loan losses  to date it is only in rare circumstances that an impaired commercial loan or commercial real estate loan is carried at a value in excess of the appraised value due to a guarantee 

when citi’s monitoring of the loan indicates that the guarantor’s wherewithal to pay is uncertain or has deteriorated there is either no change in the risk rating because the guarantor’s credit support was never initially factored in or the risk rating is adjusted to reflect that uncertainty or deterioration accordingly a guarantor’s ultimate failure to perform or a lack of legal enforcement of the guarantee does not materially impact the allowance for loan losses as there is typically no further significant adjustment of the loan’s risk rating at that time where citi is not seeking performance under the guarantee contract it provides for loan losses as if the loans were nonperforming and not guaranteed 

reserve estimates and policies 

management provides reserves for an estimate of probable losses inherent in the funded loan portfolio on the consolidated balance sheet in the form of an allowance for loan losses these reserves are established in accordance with citigroup’s credit reserve policies as approved by the audit committee of the citigroup board of directors citi’s chief risk officer and chief financial officer review the adequacy of the credit loss reserves each quarter with representatives from the risk management and finance staffs for each applicable business area applicable business areas include those having classifiably managed portfolios where internal creditrisk ratings are assigned primarily icg and gcb  or modified consumer loans where concessions were granted due to the borrowers’ financial difficulties 

the abovementioned representatives for these business areas present recommended reserve balances for their funded and unfunded lending portfolios along with supporting quantitative and qualitative data discussed below 

estimated probable losses for nonperforming nonhomogeneous exposures within a business line’s classifiably managed portfolio and impaired smallerbalance homogeneous loans whose terms have been modified due to the borrowers’ financial difficulties where it was determined that a concession was granted to the borrower  consideration may be given to the following as appropriate when determining this estimate i the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s original effective rate ii the borrower’s overall financial condition resources and payment record and iii the prospects for support from financially responsible guarantors or the realizable value of any collateral in the determination of the allowance for loan losses for tdrs management considers a combination of historical redefault rates the current economic environment and the nature of the modification program when forecasting expected cash flows when impairment is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows the entire change in present value is recorded in the provision for loan losses  

statistically calculated losses inherent in the classifiably managed portfolio for performing and de minimis nonperforming exposures  the calculation is based on i citi’s internal system of creditrisk ratings which are analogous to the risk ratings of the major rating agencies and ii historical default and loss data including rating agency information regarding default rates from 1983 to 2015 and internal data dating to the early 1970s on severity of losses in the event of default adjustments may be made to this data such adjustments include i statistically calculated estimates to cover the historical fluctuation of the default rates over the credit cycle the historical variability of loss severity among defaulted loans and the degree to which there are large obligor concentrations in the global portfolio and ii adjustments made for specific known items such as current environmental factors and credit trends 

in addition representatives from each of the risk management and finance staffs that cover business areas 

 

with delinquencymanaged portfolios containing smallerbalance homogeneous loans present their recommended reserve balances based on leading credit indicators including loan delinquencies and changes in portfolio size as well as economic trends including current and future housing prices unemployment length of time in foreclosure costs to sell and gdp this methodology is applied separately for each individual product within each geographic region in which these portfolios exist 

this evaluation process is subject to numerous estimates and judgments the frequency of default risk ratings loss recovery rates the size and diversity of individual large credits and the ability of borrowers with foreign currency obligations to obtain the foreign currency necessary for orderly debt servicing among other things are all taken into account during this review changes in these estimates could have a direct impact on the credit costs in any period and could result in a change in the allowance 

allowance for unfunded lending commitments 

a similar approach to the allowance for loan losses is used for calculating a reserve for the expected losses related to unfunded lending commitments and standby letters of credit this reserve is classified on the balance sheet in other liabilities  changes to the allowance for unfunded lending commitments are recorded in the provision for unfunded lending commitments  

mortgage servicing rights 

mortgage servicing rights msrs are recognized as intangible assets when purchased or when the company sells or securitizes loans acquired through purchase or origination and retains the right to service the loans mortgage servicing rights are accounted for at fair value with changes in value recorded in other revenue in the company’s consolidated statement of income 

for additional information on the company’s msrs see notes 16 21 and 29 to the consolidated financial statements 

goodwill 

goodwill  represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would morelikelythannot reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 

under asc 350 intangibles—goodwill and other the company has an option to assess qualitative factors to determine if it is necessary to perform the goodwill impairment test if after assessing the totality of events or circumstances the company determines that it is not morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount no further testing is necessary if however the company determines that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount then the company must perform the first step of the twostep goodwill impairment test 

the company has an unconditional option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any reporting period and proceed directly to the first step of the goodwill impairment test 

the first step requires a comparison of the fair value of the individual reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit is in excess of the carrying value the related goodwill is considered not impaired and no further analysis is necessary if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value this is an indication of potential impairment and a second step of testing is performed to measure the amount of impairment if any for that reporting unit 

if required the second step involves calculating the implied fair value of goodwill for each of the affected reporting units the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination which is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit determined in step one over the fair value of the net assets and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit were being acquired if the amount of the goodwill allocated to the reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill in the pro forma purchase price allocation an impairment charge is recorded for the excess a recognized impairment charge cannot exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to a reporting unit and cannot subsequently be reversed even if the fair value of the reporting unit recovers 

furthermore on any business dispositions goodwill is allocated to the disposed business based on the ratio of the fair value of the disposed business to the fair value of the reporting unit 

additional information on citi’s goodwill impairment testing can be found in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

intangible assets 

intangible assets including core deposit intangibles present value of future profits purchased credit card relationships credit card contract related intangibles other customer relationships and other intangible assets but excluding msrs are amortized over their estimated useful lives intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives primarily certain asset management contracts and trade names are not amortized and are subject to annual impairment tests an impairment exists if the carrying value of the indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds its fair value for other intangible assets subject to amortization an impairment is recognized if the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds the fair value of the intangible asset 

other assets and other liabilities 

other assets  include among other items loans heldforsale deferred tax assets equity method investments interest and fees receivable premises and equipment including purchased and developed software repossessed assets and other receivables other liabilities  include among other items accrued expenses and other payables deferred tax 

 

liabilities and reserves for legal claims taxes unfunded lending commitments repositioning reserves and other matters 

other real estate owned and repossessed assets 

real estate or other assets received through foreclosure or repossession are generally reported in other assets  net of a valuation allowance for selling costs and subsequent declines in fair value 

securitizations 

there are two key accounting determinations that must be made relating to securitizations citi first makes a determination as to whether the securitization entity must be consolidated second it determines whether the transfer of financial assets to the entity is considered a sale under gaap if the securitization entity is a vie the company consolidates the vie if it is the primary beneficiary as discussed in “variable interest entities” above for all other securitization entities determined not to be vies in which citigroup participates consolidation is based on which party has voting control of the entity giving consideration to removal and liquidation rights in certain partnership structures only securitization entities controlled by citigroup are consolidated 

interests in the securitized and sold assets may be retained in the form of subordinated or senior interestonly strips subordinated tranches spread accounts and servicing rights in credit card securitizations the company retains a seller’s interest in the credit card receivables transferred to the trusts which is not in securitized form in the case of consolidated securitization entities including the credit card trusts these retained interests are not reported on citi’s consolidated balance sheet the securitized loans remain on 

the balance sheet substantially all of the consumer loans sold or securitized through nonconsolidated trusts by citigroup are us prime residential mortgage loans retained interests in nonconsolidated mortgage securitization trusts are classified as trading account assets  except for msrs which are included in  mortgage servicing rights  on citigroup’s consolidated balance sheet 

debt 

shortterm borrowings and longterm debt  are accounted for at amortized cost except where the company has elected to report the debt instruments including certain structured notes at fair value or the debt is in a fair value hedging relationship 

transfers of financial assets 

for a transfer of financial assets to be considered a sale i the assets must have been legally isolated from the company even in bankruptcy or other receivership ii the purchaser must have the right to pledge or sell the assets transferred or if the purchaser is an entity whose sole purpose is to engage in securitization and assetbacked financing activities through the issuance of beneficial interests and that entity is constrained from pledging the assets it receives each beneficial interest holder must have 

the right to sell or pledge their beneficial interests and iii the company may not have an option or obligation to reacquire the assets 

if these sale requirements are met the assets are removed from the company’s consolidated balance sheet if the conditions for sale are not met the transfer is considered to be a secured borrowing the assets remain on the consolidated balance sheet and the sale proceeds are recognized as the company’s liability a legal opinion on a sale generally is obtained for complex transactions or where the company has continuing involvement with assets transferred or with the securitization entity for a transfer to be eligible for sale accounting those opinions must state that the asset transfer would be considered a sale and that the assets transferred would not be consolidated with the company’s other assets in the event of the company’s insolvency 

for a transfer of a portion of a financial asset to be considered a sale the portion transferred must meet the definition of a participating interest a participating interest must represent a pro rata ownership in an entire financial asset all cash flows must be divided proportionately with the same priority of payment no participating interest in the transferred asset may be subordinated to the interest of another participating interest holder and no party may have the right to pledge or exchange the entire financial asset unless all participating interest holders agree otherwise the transfer is accounted for as a secured borrowing 

see note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

risk management activities—derivatives used for hedging purposes 

the company manages its exposures to market rate movements outside of its trading activities by modifying the asset and liability mix either directly or through the use of derivative financial products including interestrate swaps futures forwards and purchased options as well as foreignexchange contracts these enduser derivatives are carried at fair value in other assets other liabilities trading account assets  and trading account liabilities  

 see note 22 to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of the company’s hedging and derivative activities 

employee benefits expense 

employee benefits expense includes current service costs of pension and other postretirement benefit plans which are accrued on a current basis contributions and unrestricted awards under other employee plans the amortization of restricted stock awards and costs of other employee benefits 

for its most significant pension and postretirement benefit plans significant plans citigroup measures and discloses plan obligations plan assets and periodic plan expense quarterly instead of annually the effect of remeasuring the significant plan obligations and assets by updating plan actuarial assumptions on a quarterly basis is reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and periodic plan expense all other plans all other plans are 

 

remeasured annually see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

stockbased compensation 

the company recognizes compensation expense related to stock and option awards over the requisite service period generally based on the instruments’ grantdate fair value reduced by expected forfeitures compensation cost related to awards granted to employees who meet certain age plus yearsofservice requirements retirementeligible employees is accrued in the year prior to the grant date in the same manner as the accrual for cash incentive compensation certain stock awards with performance conditions or certain clawback provisions are subject to variable accounting pursuant to which the associated compensation expense fluctuates with changes in citigroup’s stock price see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

the company is subject to the income tax laws of the us and its states and municipalities and the foreign jurisdictions in which it operates these tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities in establishing a provision for income tax expense the company must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws the company must also make estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions both domestic and foreign 

disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be subject to review and adjudication by the court systems of the various tax jurisdictions or may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit the company treats interest and penalties on income taxes as a component of income tax expense  

deferred taxes are recorded for the future consequences of events that have been recognized for financial statements or tax returns based upon enacted tax laws and rates deferred tax assets are recognized subject to management’s judgment that realization is morelikelythannot fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes” fin 48 now incorporated into asc 740 income taxes  sets out a consistent framework to determine the appropriate level of tax reserves to maintain for uncertain tax positions this interpretation uses a twostep approach wherein a tax benefit is recognized if a position is morelikelythannot to be sustained the amount of the benefit is then measured to be the highest tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely to be realized asc 740 also sets out disclosure requirements to enhance transparency of an entity’s tax reserves 

see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for a further description of the company’s tax provision and related income tax assets and liabilities 

commissions underwriting and principal transactions 

commissions revenues are recognized in income when earned underwriting revenues are recognized in income typically at the closing of the transaction principal transactions revenues are recognized in income on a tradedate basis see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the company’s revenue recognition policies for commissions and fees and note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for details of principal transactions revenue 

earnings per share 

earnings per share eps is computed after deducting preferred stock dividends the company has granted restricted and deferred share awards with dividend rights that are considered to be participating securities which are akin to a second class of common stock accordingly a portion of citigroup’s earnings is allocated to those participating securities in the eps calculation 

basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders after the allocation of dividends and undistributed earnings to the participating securities by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised it is computed after giving consideration to the weighted average dilutive effect of the company’s stock options and warrants and convertible securities and after the allocation of earnings to the participating securities antidilutive options and warrants are disregarded in the eps calculations 

use of estimates 

management must make estimates and assumptions that affect the consolidated financial statements and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements such estimates are used in connection with certain fair value measurements see note 24 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussions on estimates used in the determination of fair value moreover estimates are significant in determining the amounts of otherthantemporary impairments impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets provisions for probable losses that may arise from creditrelated exposures and probable and estimable losses related to litigation and regulatory proceedings and tax reserves while management makes its best judgment actual amounts or results could differ from those estimates 

cash flows 

cash equivalents are defined as those amounts included in cash and due from banks  cash flows from risk management activities are classified in the same category as the related assets and liabilities

accounting changes 

recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities 

in january 2016 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 201601 financial instruments—overall subtopic 82510 recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities  which addresses certain aspects of recognition measurement presentation and disclosure of financial instruments 

this asu requires entities to present separately in accumulated other comprehensive income loss aoci the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrumentspecific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments it also requires equity investments except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income thus eliminating eligibility for the current availableforsale category however federal reserve bank and federal home loan bank stock as well as certain exchange seats will continue to be presented at cost 

citi early adopted only the provisions of this asu related to presentation of the changes in fair value of liabilities for which the fair value option was elected related to changes in citigroup’s own credit spreads in aoci effective january 1 2016 accordingly as of the first quarter 2016 these amounts are reflected as a component of aoci whereas these amounts were previously recognized in citigroup’s revenues and net income the impact of adopting this amendment resulted in a cumulative catchup reclassification from retained earnings to aoci of an accumulated aftertax loss of approximately 15 million  at january 1 2016 financial statements for periods prior to 2016 were not subject to restatement under the provisions of this asu for additional information see note 19 note 24   and note 25 to the consolidated financial statements the company is evaluating the effect that the other provisions of asu 201601 which are effective on january 1 2018 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 

accounting for investments in tax credit partnerships 

in january 2014 the fasb issued asu no 201401 investments—equity method and joint ventures topic 323 accounting for investments in qualified affordable housing projects  any transition adjustment is reflected as an adjustment to retained earnings in the earliest period presented retrospective application 

the asu is applicable to citi’s portfolio of low income housing tax credit lihtc partnership interests the new standard widens the scope of investments eligible to elect to apply a new alternative method the proportional amortization method under which the cost of the investment is amortized to tax expense in proportion to the amount of tax credits and other tax benefits received citi qualifies to elect the proportional amortization method under the asu for its entire lihtc portfolio these investments were previously accounted for under the equity method which resulted in losses due to amortization of the investment being recognized in other revenue  and tax credits and benefits being recognized in the income tax expense  line in contrast the proportional amortization method combines the amortization of the investment and receipt of the tax creditsbenefits into one line income tax expense  

citi adopted asu 201401 in the first quarter of 2015 

the adoption of this asu was applied retrospectively and cumulatively reduced retained earnings  by approximately 349 million  other assets  by approximately 178 million  and deferred tax assets by approximately 171 million  

accounting for repurchasetomaturity transactions 

in june 2014 the fasb issued asu no 201411 transfers and servicing topic 860 repurchasetomaturity transactions repurchase financings and disclosures  the asu changes the accounting for repurchasetomaturity transactions and linked repurchase financings to secured borrowing accounting which is consistent with the accounting for other repurchase agreements the asu also requires disclosures about transfers accounted for as sales in transactions that are economically similar to repurchase agreements see note 24 to the consolidated financial statements and about the types of collateral pledged in repurchase agreements and similar transactions accounted for as secured borrowings see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements the asu’s provisions became effective for citi in the first quarter of 2015 with the exception of the collateral disclosures which became effective in the second quarter of 2015 the effect of adopting the asu was required to be reflected as a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption adoption of the asu did not have a material effect on the company’s financial statements 

disclosures for investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value nav per share 

in may 2015 the fasb issued asu no 201507 fair value measurement topic 820 disclosures for investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value per share or its equivalent  which is intended to reduce diversity in practice related to the categorization of investments measured at nav within the fair value hierarchy the asu removes the current requirement to categorize investments for which fair value is measured using the nav per share practical expedient within the fair value hierarchy citi elected to early adopt the asu in the second quarter of 2015 the adoption of the asu was applied retrospectively and 

 

reduced level 3 assets by 10 billion  and 11 billion  as of december 31 2015 and december 31 2014 respectively 

future application of accounting standards 

accounting for financial instruments—credit losses 

in june 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201613 financial instruments—credit losses  topic 326   the asu introduces a new accounting model the current expected credit losses model cecl which requires earlier recognition of credit losses while also providing additional transparency about credit risk 

the fasb’s cecl model utilizes a lifetime “expected credit loss” measurement objective for the recognition of credit losses for loans heldtomaturity securities and other receivables at the time the financial asset is originated or acquired the expected credit losses are adjusted each period for changes in expected lifetime credit losses for availableforsale securities where fair value is less than cost creditrelated impairment if any will be recognized in an allowance for credit losses and adjusted each period for changes in expected credit risk this model replaces the multiple existing impairment models in current gaap which generally require that a loss be incurred before it is recognized 

the cecl model represents a significant departure from existing gaap and may result in material changes to the company’s accounting for financial instruments the company is evaluating the effect that asu 201613 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures the impact of the asu will depend upon the state of the economy and the nature of citi’s portfolios at the date of adoption the asu will be effective for citi as of january 1 2020 early application is permitted for annual periods beginning january 1 2019 

revenue recognition 

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers  which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers the company will adopt the guidance as of january 1 2018 with a cumulativeeffect adjustment to opening retained earnings while the guidance will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in gaap the asu is not applicable to financial instruments and therefore will not impact a majority of the company’s revenue including net interest income 

while in scope of the new guidance the company does not expect a material change in the timing or measurement of revenues related to deposit fees citi’s credit cardholder fees and mortgage servicing fees have been concluded to be out of scope of the standard and therefore will not be impacted by the issuance of this guidance the company expects the presentation of expenses associated with underwriting activity to change from the current reporting where underwriting revenue is recorded net of the related expenses to a gross presentation where the expenses are 

recorded in other operating expenses  this change to a gross presentation will result in an equivalent increase in underwriting revenue recorded in commissions and fees  and associated underwriting expenses recorded in other operating expenses  however this change in presentation will not have an impact on income from continuing operations  the company continues to evaluate the effect that the guidance will have on other revenue streams within its scope including the presentation of certain contract expenses as well as changes in disclosures required by the new guidance 

lease accounting 

in february 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201602 leases topic 842 which is intended to increase transparency and comparability of accounting for lease transactions the asu will require lessees to recognize all leases on the balance sheet as lease assets and lease liabilities and will require both quantitative and qualitative disclosures regarding key information about leasing arrangements lessor accounting is largely unchanged the guidance is effective beginning january 1 2019 with an option to early adopt the company does not plan to early adopt the asu the company is evaluating the effect that the standard will have on its consolidated financial statements regulatory capital and related disclosures 

accounting for stockbased compensation 

in march 2016 the fasb issued asu 201609 compensation—stock compensation topic 718 improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting  in order to simplify certain complex aspects of the accounting for income taxes and forfeitures related to employee stockbased compensation the guidance is effective for citi beginning on january 1 2017 under the new standard excess tax benefits and deficiencies related to employee stockbased compensation will be recognized directly within income tax expense or benefit in citi’s consolidated statement of income rather than within additional paidin capital additionally as permitted under the new guidance citi will make an accounting policy election to account for forfeitures of awards as they occur which represents a change from the current requirement to estimate forfeitures when recognizing compensation expense the company continues to evaluate the effect that asu 201609 will have on its consolidated financial statements 

income tax impact of intraentity transfers of assets 

in october 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201616 income taxes—intraentity transfers of assets other than inventory  which will require an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of an intraentity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs the asu is effective on january 1 2018 with early adoption permitted the company continues to evaluate the impact of this standard which is expected to increase dtas with an associated decrease in prepaid taxes 

 

subsequent measurement of goodwill 

in january 2017 the fasb issued asu no 201704 intangibles—goodwill and other topic 350 simplifying the test for goodwill impairment the asu simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill impairment by eliminating the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill ie the current step 2 of the goodwill impairment test to measure a goodwill impairment charge   with the asu the impairment test is simply the comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount the current step 1 with the impairment charge being the deficit in fair value but not exceeding the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit the simplified onestep impairment test applies to all reporting units including those with zero or negative carrying amounts 

the asu is effective for citi as of january 1 2020 early adoption is permitted for interim and annual goodwill impairment testing dates after january 1 2017 the impact of the asu will depend upon the performance of the reporting units and the market conditions impacting the fair value of each reporting unit going forward 

clarifying the definition of a business 

in january 2017 the fasb issued asu no 201701 business combinations topic 805 clarifying the definition of a business the definition of a business directly and indirectly affects many areas of accounting eg acquisitions disposals goodwill and consolidation the asu narrows the definition of a business by introducing a quantitative screen as the first step such that if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets the set of transferred assets and activities is not a business if the set is not scoped out from the quantitative screen the entity then evaluates whether the set meets the requirement that a business include at a minimum an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs 

the asu is effective for citi as of january 1 2018 the asu will be applied prospectively with early adoption permitted the impact of the asu will depend upon the acquisition and disposal activities of citi if fewer transactions qualify as a business there could be less initial recognition of goodwill but also less goodwill allocated to disposals 

other potential amendments to current accounting standards 

the fasb has issued a proposed asu that will provide targeted improvements to the accounting guidance for hedging activities the exposure draft contains many proposals for improving how the economic results of risk management are reflected in financial reporting specifically among other improvements the asu is expected to expand the list of benchmark interest rates and also increase the ability for entities to construct hedges of interest rate risk that hedge only certain cash flows of a hedged item if issued in its current form the asu is also expected modify existing guidance related to the timing and 

income statement line recognition of ineffectiveness and components excluded from hedge relationships and add incremental disclosures regarding hedging activities 

the fasb has also issued a proposed asu that will change the period of amortization of premiums on certain callable debt securities from the full contractual life of the security to the first call date of the security the proposed change will not change the accretion of discounts it is expected that the final standard will be issued during the second quarter of 2017 and will be eligible for early adoption with an effective date of january 1 2017 through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings this accounting change will primarily affect citi’s portfolios of availableforsale and heldtomaturity state and municipal debt securities 

the impact of these final asus on the company’s financial statements will be assessed when the respective final standards are issued

7 incentive plans 

  

discretionary annual incentive awards 

citigroup grants immediate cash bonus payments and various forms of immediate and deferred awards as part of its discretionary annual incentive award program involving a large segment of citigroup’s employees worldwide most of the shares of common stock issued by citigroup as part of its equity compensation programs are to settle the vesting of the stock components of these awards 

discretionary annual incentive awards are generally awarded in the first quarter of the year based upon the previous year’s performance awards valued at less than us 100000  or the local currency equivalent are generally paid entirely in the form of an immediate cash bonus pursuant to citigroup policy andor regulatory requirements certain employees and officers are subject to mandatory deferrals of incentive pay and generally receive 25  to 60  of their awards in a combination of restricted or deferred stock deferred cash stock units or deferred cash discretionary annual incentive awards to many employees in the eu are subject to deferral requirements regardless of the total award value with 50  of the immediate incentive delivered in the form of a stock payment or stock unit award subject to a restriction on sale or transfer or hold back generally for six  months 

deferred annual incentive awards may be delivered in the form of one or more award types—a restricted or deferred stock award under citi’s capital accumulation program cap or a deferred cash stock unit award andor a deferred cash award under citi’s deferred cash award plan the applicable mix of awards may vary based on the employee’s minimum deferral requirement and the country of employment 

subject to certain exceptions principally for retirementeligible employees continuous employment within citigroup is required to vest in cap deferred cash stock unit and deferred cash awards post employment vesting by retirementeligible employees and participants who meet other conditions is generally conditioned upon their refraining from competition with citigroup during the remaining vesting period unless the employment relationship has been terminated by citigroup under certain conditions 

generally the deferred awards vest in equal annual installments over three  or four year periods vested cap awards are delivered in shares of common stock deferred cash awards are payable in cash and earn a fixed notional rate of interest that is paid only if and when the underlying principal award amount vests deferred cash stock unit awards are payable in cash at the vesting value of the underlying stock generally in the eu vested cap shares are subject to a restriction on sale or transfer after vesting and vested deferred cash awards and deferred cash stock units are subject to hold back generally for six  months in each case 

unvested cap deferred cash stock units and deferred cash awards made in january 2011 or later are subject to one or more clawback provisions that apply in certain circumstances including in the case of employee risklimit violations or other misconduct or where the awards were 

 

based on earnings that were misstated cap awards made to certain employees in february 2013 and later deferred cash stock units made to certain employees in february 2016 and later and deferred cash awards made to certain employees in january 2012 are subject to a formulaic performancebased vesting condition pursuant to which amounts otherwise scheduled to vest will be reduced based on the amount of any pretax loss in the participant’s business in the calendar year preceding the scheduled vesting date for cap awards made in february 2013 and later and deferred cash stock units made in february 2016 and later a minimum reduction of 20  applies for the first dollar of loss 

in addition deferred cash awards made to certain employees in february 2013 and later are subject to a discretionary performancebased vesting condition under which an amount otherwise scheduled to vest may be reduced in the event of a “material adverse outcome” for which a participant has “significant responsibility” deferred cash awards made to these employees in february 2014 and later are subject to an additional clawback provision pursuant to which unvested awards may be canceled if the employee engaged in misconduct or exercised materially imprudent judgment or failed to supervise or escalate the behavior of other employees who did 

certain cap and other stockbased awards including those to participants in the eu that are subject to certain discretionary clawback provisions are subject to variable accounting pursuant to which the associated value of the award fluctuates with changes in citigroup’s common stock price until the date that the award is settled either in cash or shares for these awards the total amount that will be recognized as expense cannot be determined in full until the settlement date 

signon and longterm retention awards 

stock awards and deferred cash awards may be made at various times during the year as signon awards to induce new hires to join citi or to highpotential employees as longterm retention awards 

vesting periods and other terms and conditions pertaining to these awards tend to vary by grant generally recipients must remain employed through the vesting dates to vest in the awards except in cases of death disability or involuntary termination other than for “gross misconduct” these awards do not usually provide for post employment vesting by retirementeligible participants 

outstanding unvested stock awards 

a summary of the status of unvested stock awards granted as discretionary annual incentive or signon and longterm retention awards is presented below 



 total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock awards excluding the impact of forfeiture estimates was 597 million  at december 31 2016 the cost is expected to be recognized over a weightedaverage period of 16 years  however the value of the portion of these awards that is subject to variable accounting will fluctuate with changes in citigroup’s common stock price 

performance share units 

certain executive officers were awarded a target number of performance share units psus on february 19 2013 for performance in 2012 and to a broader group of executives on february 18 2014 february 18 2015 and february 16 2016 for performance in the year prior to the award date for grants prior to 2016 psus will be earned only to the extent that citigroup attains specified performance goals relating to citigroup’s return on assets and relative total shareholder return against peers over the three year period beginning with the year of award the actual dollar amounts ultimately earned could vary from zero  if performance goals are not met to as much as 150  of target if performance goals are meaningfully exceeded the value of each psu is equal to the value of one  share of citi common stock 

      the psus granted on february 16 2016 are earned over a three year performance period based on citigroup’s relative total shareholder return as compared to peers the actual dollar amounts ultimately earned could vary from zero  if performance goals are not met to as much as 150  of target if performance goals are meaningfully exceeded if the total shareholder return is negative over the three year performance period executives may earn no more than 100  of the target psus regardless of the extent to which citi outperforms peer firms the value of each psu is equal to the value of one  share of citi common stock 

 

      psus are subject to variable accounting pursuant to which the associated value of the award will fluctuate with changes in citigroup’s stock price and the attainment of the specified performance goals for each award until the award is settled solely in cash after the end of the performance period the value of the award subject to the performance goals is estimated using a simulation model that incorporates multiple valuation assumptions including the probability of achieving the specified performance goals of each award the riskfree rate used in the model is based on the applicable us treasury yield curve other significant assumptions for the awards are as follows 



    

  

a summary of the performance share unit activity for 2016 is presented below 



1 the weightedaverage grant date fair value per unit awarded in 2015 and 2014 was 4407  and 4834  respectively 

stock option programs 

stock options have not been granted to citi’s employees as part of the annual incentive award programs since 2009 

all outstanding stock options are fully vested with the related expense recognized as a charge to income in prior periods generally the stock options outstanding have a six year term with some stock options subject to various transfer restrictions cash received from employee stock option exercises under this program for the year ended december 31 2016 was approximately 53 million  

information with respect to stock option activity under citigroup’s stock option programs is shown below 



      the following table summarizes information about stock options outstanding under citigroup’s stock option programs at december 31 2016 



other variable incentive compensation 

citigroup has various incentive plans globally that are used to motivate and reward performance primarily in the areas of sales operational excellence and customer satisfaction participation in these plans is generally limited to employees who are not eligible for discretionary annual incentive awards 

summary 

except for awards subject to variable accounting the total expense recognized for stock awards represents the grant date fair value of such awards which is generally recognized as a charge to income ratably over the vesting period other than for awards to retirementeligible employees and immediately vested awards whenever awards are made or are expected to be made to retirementeligible employees the charge to income is accelerated based on when the applicable conditions to retirement eligibility were or will be met if the employee is retirement eligible on the grant date or the award is vested at grant date the entire expense is recognized in the year prior to grant 

recipients of citigroup stock awards generally do not have any stockholder rights until shares are delivered upon vesting or exercise or after the expiration of applicable required holding periods recipients of restricted or deferred stock awards and deferred cash stock unit awards however may be entitled to receive dividends or dividendequivalent payments during the vesting period recipients of restricted stock awards generally are entitled to vote the shares in their award during the vesting period once a stock award vests the 

 

shares are freely transferable unless they are subject to a restriction on sale or transfer for a specified period 

all equity awards granted since april 19 2005 have been made pursuant to stockholderapproved stock incentive plans that are administered by the personnel and compensation committee of the citigroup board of directors which is composed entirely of independent nonemployee directors 

at december 31 2016 approximately 521 million  shares of citigroup common stock were authorized and available for grant under citigroup’s 2014 stock incentive plan the only plan from which equity awards are currently granted 

the 2014 stock incentive plan and predecessor plans permit the use of treasury stock or newly issued shares in connection with awards granted under the plans newly issued shares were distributed to settle the vesting of the majority of annual deferred stock awards from 2012 to 2015 treasury shares were used to settle vestings in 2016 and the first quarter of 2017 except where securities laws require newly issued shares the use of treasury stock or newly issued shares to settle stock awards does not affect the compensation expense recorded in the consolidated statement of income for equity awards 

incentive compensation cost 

the following table shows components of compensation expense relating to certain of the above incentive compensation programs 



 

 

future expenses associated with outstanding unvested awards 

citi expects to record compensation expense in future periods as a result of awards granted for performance in 2016 and prior years because the awards contain service or other conditions that will be satisfied in the future the expense of these alreadygranted awards is recognized over those future periods the portion of these awards that is subject to variable accounting will cause the expense amount to fluctuate with changes in citigroup’s common stock price citis expected future expenses excluding the impact of forfeitures cancelations clawbacks and repositioningrelated accelerations that have not yet occurred are summarized in the table below

the company also sponsors a number of noncontributory nonqualified pension plans these plans which are unfunded provide supplemental defined pension benefits to certain us 

 

employees with the exception of certain employees covered under the prior final pay plan formula the benefits under these plans were frozen in prior years 

the plan obligations plan assets and periodic plan expense for the company’s most significant pension and postretirement benefit plans significant plans are measured and disclosed quarterly instead of annually the significant plans captured approximately 90  of the company’s global pension and postretirement plan obligations as of december 31 2016 all other plans all other plans are measured annually with a december 31 measurement date 

net benefit expense 

the following table summarizes the components of net benefit expense recognized in the consolidated statement of income for the company’s pension and postretirement plans for significant plans and all other plans 



 

the estimated net actuarial loss and prior service benefit cost that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income loss  into net expense in 2017 are approximately 233 million  and 2 million  respectively for defined benefit pension plans 

for postretirement plans the estimated 2017 net actuarial loss and prior service benefit cost amortizations are approximately 28 million  and 9 million  respectively 

 

contributions 

the company’s funding practice for us and nonus pension and postretirement plans is generally to fund to minimum funding requirements in accordance with applicable local laws and regulations the company may increase its contributions above the minimum required contribution if appropriate in addition management has the ability to change its funding practices for the us pension plans there were no required minimum cash contributions for 2016 or 2015 

 

the following table summarizes the actual company contributions for the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  as well as estimated expected company contributions for 2017 expected contributions are subject to change since contribution decisions are affected by various factors such as market performance tax considerations and regulatory requirements 



 

funded status and accumulated other comprehensive income 

the following tables summarize the funded status and amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheet for the company’s pension and postretirement plans 

 







 

the following table shows the change in accumulated other comprehensive income loss related to the company’s pension postretirement and post employment plans 

 

at december 31 2016 and 2015 the aggregate projected benefit obligation pbo the aggregate accumulated benefit obligation abo and the aggregate fair value of plan assets are presented for all defined benefit pension plans with a pbo in excess of plan assets and for all defined benefit pension plans with an abo in excess of plan assets as follows 

 



 

plan assumptions 

the company utilizes a number of assumptions to determine plan obligations and expenses changes in one or a combination of these assumptions will have an impact on the company’s pension and postretirement pbo funded status and benefit expense changes in the plans’ funded status resulting from changes in the pbo and fair value of plan assets will have a corresponding impact on accumulated other comprehensive income loss  

the actuarial assumptions at the respective years ended december 31 in the table below are used to measure the yearend pbo and the net periodic benefit expense for the subsequent year period since citi’s significant plans are measured on a quarterly basis the yearend rates for those plans are used to calculate the net periodic benefit expense for the subsequent year’s first quarter as a result of the quarterly measurement process the net periodic benefit expense for the significant plans is calculated at each respective quarter end based on the preceding quarterend rates as shown below for the us and nonus pension and postretirement plans the actuarial assumptions for all other plans are measured annually 

certain assumptions used in determining pension and postretirement benefit obligations and net benefit expense for the company’s plans are shown in the following table 



 

 



1 reflects rates utilized to determine the first quarter expense for significant nonus pension and postretirement plans 



discount rate 

the discount rates for the us pension and postretirement plans were selected by reference to a citigroupspecific analysis using each plan’s specific cash flows and compared with highquality corporate bond indices for reasonableness the discount rates for the nonus pension and postretirement plans are selected by reference to highquality corporate bond rates in countries that have developed corporate bond markets however where developed corporate bond markets do not exist the discount rates are selected by reference to local government bond rates with a premium added to reflect the additional risk for corporate bonds in certain countries 

effective december 31 2016 the established rounding convention was to the nearest 5 basis points for the top five nonus countries 10 basis points for japan and 25 basis points for all other countries 

expected rate of return 

the company determines its assumptions for the expected rate of return on plan assets for its us pension and postretirement plans using a “building block” approach which focuses on ranges of anticipated rates of return for each asset class a weighted average range of nominal rates is then determined based on target allocations to each asset class market performance over a number of earlier years is evaluated covering a wide range of economic conditions to determine whether there are sound reasons for projecting any past trends 

the company considers the expected rate of return to be a longterm assessment of return expectations and does not anticipate changing this assumption unless there are significant changes in investment strategy or economic conditions this contrasts with the selection of the discount rate and certain other assumptions which are reconsidered annually or quarterly for the significant plans in accordance with gaap 

the expected rate of return for the us pension and postretirement plans was 680  at december 31 2016 and was 700  at december 31 2015 and 2014 the expected return on assets reflects the expected annual appreciation of the plan assets and reduces the company’s annual pension expense the expected return on assets is deducted from the sum of service cost interest cost and other components of pension expense to arrive at the net pension benefit expense net pension benefit expense for the us pension plans for 2016 2015 and 2014 reflects deductions of 886 million  893 million  and 878 million  of expected returns respectively 

 

the following table shows the expected rates of return used in determining the company’s pension expense compared to the actual rate of return on plan assets during 2016 2015 and 2014 for the us pension and postretirement plans 



 

for the nonus pension plans pension expense for 2016 was reduced by the expected return of 287 million  compared with the actual return of 967 million  pension expense for 2015 and 2014 was reduced by expected returns of 323 million  and 384 million  respectively 

mortality tables 

at december 31 2016 the company maintained the retirement plan 2014 rp2014 mortality table and adopted the mortality projection 2016 mp2016 projection table for the us plans 



 

  

sensitivities of certain key assumptions 

the following tables summarize the effect on pension expense of a onepercentagepoint change in the discount rate 



since the us qualified pension plan was frozen most of the prospective service cost has been eliminated and the gainloss amortization period was changed to the life expectancy for inactive participants as a result pension expense for the us qualified pension plan is driven more by interest costs than service costs and an increase in the discount rate would increase pension expense while a decrease in the discount rate would decrease pension expense 

the following tables summarize the effect on pension expense of a onepercentagepoint change in the expected rates of return 



  



  

 

health care cost trend rate 

assumed health care cost trend rates were as follows 



1 weighted average for plans with different following year and ultimate rates 



a onepercentagepoint change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects 



plan assets 

citigroup’s pension and postretirement plans’ asset allocations for the us plans and the target allocations by asset category based on asset fair values are as follows 



 

        thirdparty investment managers and advisers provide their services to citigroup’s us pension and postretirement plans assets are rebalanced as the company’s pension plan investment committee deems appropriate citigroup’s investment strategy with respect to its assets is to maintain a globally diversified investment portfolio across several asset classes that when combined with citigroup’s contributions to 

 

the plans will maintain the plans’ ability to meet all required benefit obligations 

citigroup’s pension and postretirement plans’ weightedaverage asset allocations for the nonus plans and the actual ranges and the weightedaverage target allocations by asset category based on asset fair values are as follows 



  

 

 

fair value disclosure 

for information on fair value measurements including descriptions of levels 1 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy and the valuation methodology utilized by the company see note 1 and note 25 to the consolidated financial statements asu 201507 removed the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy investments for which fair value is measured using the nav per share practical expedient 

 

certain investments may transfer between the fair value hierarchy classifications during the year due to changes in valuation methodology and pricing sources there were no significant transfers of investments between level 1 and level 2 during 2016 and 2015 

plan assets by detailed asset categories and the fair value hierarchy are as follows 



 





  



level 3 rollforward 

the reconciliations of the beginning and ending balances during the year for level 3 assets are as follows 



  



 





 

investment strategy 

the company’s global pension and postretirement funds’ investment strategy is to invest in a prudent manner for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits to participants the investment strategies are targeted to produce a total return that when combined with the company’s contributions to the funds will maintain the funds’ ability to meet all required benefit obligations risk is controlled through diversification of asset types and investments in domestic and international equities fixedincome securities and cash and shortterm investments the target asset allocation in most locations outside the us is primarily in equity and debt securities these allocations may vary by geographic region and country depending on the nature of applicable obligations and various other regional considerations the wide variation in the actual range of plan asset allocations for the funded nonus plans is a result of differing local statutory requirements and economic conditions for example in certain countries local law requires that all pension plan assets must be invested in fixedincome investments government funds or localcountry securities 

  

significant concentrations of risk in plan assets 

the assets of the company’s pension plans are diversified to limit the impact of any individual investment the us qualified pension plan is diversified across multiple asset classes with publicly traded fixed income hedge funds publicly traded equity and private equity representing the most significant asset allocations investments in these four asset classes are further diversified across funds managers strategies vintages sectors and geographies depending on the specific characteristics of each asset class the pension assets for the company’s nonus significant plans are primarily invested in publicly traded fixed income and publicly traded equity securities 

oversight and risk management practices 

the framework for the company’s pension oversight process includes monitoring of retirement plans by plan fiduciaries andor management at the global regional or country level as appropriate independent risk management contributes to the risk oversight and monitoring for the company’s us qualified pension plan and nonus significant pension plans although the specific components of the oversight process are tailored to the requirements of each region country and plan the following elements are common to the company’s monitoring and risk management process 

  



estimated future benefit payments   

the company expects to pay the following estimated benefit payments in future years 



prescription drugs 

in december 2003 the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 act of 2003 was enacted the act of 2003 established a prescription drug benefit under medicare known as “medicare part d” and a federal subsidy to sponsors of us retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to medicare part d the benefits provided to certain participants are at least actuarially equivalent to medicare part d and accordingly the company is entitled to a subsidy 

the subsidy reduced the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation apbo by approximately 5 million  as of december 31 2016 and 2015 and the postretirement expense by approximately 02 million  for 2016 and 2015 

the following table shows the estimated future benefit payments from the medicare part d subsidy of the us postretirement plan 



  

certain provisions of the patient protection and affordable care act of 2010 improved the medicare part d option known as the employer group waiver plan egwp with respect to the medicare part d subsidy the egwp provides prescription drug benefits that are more cost effective for medicareeligible participants and large employers effective april 1 2013 the company began sponsoring and implementing an egwp for eligible retirees the company subsidy received under the egwp for 2016 and 2015 was 129 million  and 116 million  respectively 

the other provisions of the act of 2010 are not expected to have a significant impact on citigroup’s pension and postretirement plans 

 

  

post employment plans 

the company sponsors us post employment plans that provide income continuation and health and welfare benefits to certain eligible us employees on longterm disability 

as of december 31 2016 and 2015 the plans’ funded status recognized in the company’s consolidated balance sheet was 157 million  and 183 million  respectively the amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  as of december 31 2016 and 2015 were 34 million  and 45 million  respectively effective january 1 2014 the company made changes to its post employment plans that limit the period for which future disabled employees are eligible for continued companysubsidized medical benefits 

the following table summarizes the components of net expense recognized in the consolidated statement of income for the company’s us post employment plans 



the following table summarizes certain assumptions used in determining the post employment benefit obligations and net benefit expense for the company’s us post employment plans 



 

defined contribution plans 

the company sponsors defined contribution plans in the us and in certain nonus locations all of which are administered in accordance with local laws the most significant defined contribution plan is the citi retirement savings plan formerly known as the citigroup 401k plan sponsored by the company in the us 

under the citi retirement savings plan eligible us employees received matching contributions of up to 6  of their eligible compensation for 2016 and 2015 subject to statutory limits additionally for eligible employees whose eligible compensation is 100000  or less a fixed contribution of up to 2  of eligible compensation is provided all company contributions are invested according to participants’ individual elections the following table summarizes the company contributions for the defined contribution plans 



9 income taxes 

details of the company’s income tax provision are presented below 

income tax provision 



   

 

tax rate 

the reconciliation of the federal statutory income tax rate to the company’s effective income tax rate applicable to income from continuing operations before noncontrolling interests and the cumulative effect of accounting changes for each of the periods indicated is as follows 



   

as set forth in the table above citi’s effective tax rate for 2016 was 300  the same as the effective tax rate in 2015 

deferred income taxes 

deferred income taxes at december 31 related to the following 



 

unrecognized tax benefits 

the following is a rollforward of the company’s unrecognized tax benefits 



the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 that if recognized would affect citi’s tax expense are 08 billion  09 billion  and 08 billion  respectively the remaining uncertain tax positions have offsetting amounts in other jurisdictions or are temporary differences 

interest and penalties not included in “unrecognized tax benefits” above are a component of the provision for income taxes  



 as of december 31 2016 citi is under audit by the internal revenue service and other major taxing jurisdictions around the world it is thus reasonably possible that significant changes in the gross balance of unrecognized tax benefits may occur within the next 12 months although citi does not expect such audits to result in amounts that would cause a significant change to its effective tax rate other than as discussed below 

 citi has concluded certain state and local tax audits the gross uncertain tax positions at december 31 2016 relating to such audits are 78 million  the tax benefit to continuing operations is expected to be 51 million  in the first quarter of 2017 

 

the following are the major tax jurisdictions in which the company and its affiliates operate and the earliest tax year subject to examination 



foreign earnings 

foreign pretax earnings approximated 116 billion  in 2016 113 billion  in 2015 and 101 billion  in 2014 as a us corporation citigroup and its us subsidiaries are currently subject to us taxation on all foreign pretax earnings of a foreign branch pretax earnings of a foreign subsidiary or affiliate are subject to us taxation when effectively repatriated the company provides income taxes on the undistributed earnings of nonus subsidiaries except to the extent that such earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the united states 

at december 31 2016 470 billion  of accumulated undistributed earnings of nonus subsidiaries was indefinitely invested at the existing us federal income tax rate additional taxes net of us foreign tax credits of 131 billion  would have to be provided if such earnings were remitted currently the current year’s effect on the income tax expense from continuing operations is included in the “foreign income tax rate differential” line in the reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the company’s effective income tax rate in the table above 

income taxes are not provided for the company’s “savings bank base year bad debt reserves” that arose before 1988 because under current us tax rules such taxes will become payable only to the extent such amounts are distributed in excess of limits prescribed by federal law at december 31 2016 the amount of the base year reserves totaled approximately 358 million  subject to a tax of 125 million  

deferred tax assets 

as of december 31 2016 and 2015 citi had no valuation allowance on its dtas the following table summarizes citi’s dtas 



  

 

 

the following table summarizes the amounts of tax carryforwards and their expiration dates 





while citi’s net total dtas decreased yearoveryear the time remaining for utilization has shortened given the passage of time particularly with respect to the foreign tax credit ftc component of the dtas although realization is not assured citi believes that the realization of the recognized net dtas of 467 billion  at december 31 2016 is morelikelythannot based upon expectations as to future taxable income in the jurisdictions in which the dtas arise and available tax planning strategies as defined in asc 740 income taxes  that would be implemented if necessary to prevent a carryforward from expiring 

citi has concluded that it has the necessary positive evidence to support the full realization of its dtas specifically citi forecasts sufficient us taxable income in the carryforward periods exclusive of asc 740 tax planning strategies citi’s forecasted taxable income which will continue to be subject to overall market and global economic conditions incorporates geographic business forecasts and taxable income adjustments to those forecasts eg us taxexempt income loan loss reserves deductible for us tax reporting in subsequent years and actions intended to optimize its us taxable earnings in general citi would need to generate approximately 57 billion  of us taxable income during the ftc carryforward periods to prevent this most timesensitive component of citi’s ftcs from expiring 

in addition to its forecasted us taxable income citi has sufficient tax planning strategies available to it under asc 740 that would be implemented if necessary to prevent a carryforward from expiring these strategies include repatriating lowtaxed foreign source earnings for which an assertion that the earnings have been indefinitely reinvested has not been made accelerating us taxable income into or deferring us tax deductions out of the latter years of the carryforward period eg selling appreciated assets electing straightline depreciation accelerating deductible temporary differences outside the us and selling certain assets that produce taxexempt income while purchasing assets that produce fully taxable income in addition the sale or restructuring of certain businesses can produce significant us taxable income within the relevant carryforward periods 

based upon the foregoing discussion citi believes   the us federal and new york state and city nol carryforward period of 20  years provides enough time to fully utilize the dtas pertaining to the existing nol carryforwards and any nol that would be created by the reversal of the future net deductions that have not yet been taken on a tax return 

with respect to the ftcs component of the dtas the carryforward period is 10  years utilization of ftcs in any year is restricted to 35  of foreign source taxable income in that year however overall domestic losses that citi has incurred of approximately 49 billion  as of december 31 2016 are allowed to be reclassified as foreign source income to the extent of 50  of domestic source income produced in subsequent years such resulting foreign source income would cover the ftcs being carried forward as noted in the table above citi’s ftc carryforwards were 142 billion  as of december 31 2016 compared to 159 billion  as of december 31 2015 this decrease represented 17 billion  of 

 

the 12 billion  decrease in citi’s overall dtas during 2016 partially offset by an increase in aoci related dtas citi believes that it will generate sufficient us taxable income within the 10 year carryforward period to be able to fully utilize the ftcs in addition to any ftcs produced in the tax return for such period which must be used prior to any carryforward utilization 

10 earnings per share 

the following table reconciles the income and share data used in the basic and diluted earnings per share eps computations 



 

11 federal funds securities borrowed loaned and subject to repurchase agreements 

federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell  at their respective carrying values consisted of the following 



federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase  at their respective carrying values consisted of the following 



 

the resale and repurchase agreements represent collateralized financing transactions citi executes these transactions primarily through its brokerdealer subsidiaries to facilitate customer matchedbook activity and to efficiently fund a portion of citi’s trading inventory transactions executed by citi’s bank subsidiaries primarily facilitate customer financing activity 

to maintain reliable funding under a wide range of market conditions including under periods of stress citi manages these activities by taking into consideration the quality of the underlying collateral and stipulating financing tenor citi manages the risks in its collateralized financing transactions by conducting daily stress tests to account for changes in capacity tenors haircut collateral profile and client actions additionally citi maintains counterparty diversification by establishing concentration triggers and assessing counterparty reliability and stability under stress 

it is citi’s policy to take possession of the underlying collateral monitor its market value relative to the amounts due under the agreements and when necessary require prompt transfer of additional collateral in order to maintain contractual margin protection for resale and repurchase 

 

agreements when necessary citi posts additional collateral in order to maintain contractual margin protection 

collateral typically consists of government and governmentagency securities corporate and municipal bonds equities and mortgagebacked and other assetbacked securities 

the resale and repurchase agreements are generally documented under industry standard agreements that allow the prompt closeout of all transactions including the liquidation of securities held and the offsetting of obligations to return cash or securities by the nondefaulting party following a payment default or other type of default under the relevant master agreement events of default generally include i failure to deliver cash or securities as required under the transaction ii failure to provide or return cash or securities as used for margining purposes iii breach of representation iv crossdefault to another transaction entered into among the parties or in some cases their affiliates and v a repudiation of obligations under the agreement the counterparty that receives the securities in these transactions is generally unrestricted in its use of the securities with the exception of transactions executed on a triparty basis where the collateral is maintained by a custodian and operational limitations may restrict its use of the securities 

a substantial portion of the resale and repurchase agreements is recorded at fair value as described in notes 24 and 25 to the consolidated financial statements the remaining portion is carried at the amount of cash initially advanced or received plus accrued interest as specified in the respective agreements 

the securities borrowing and lending agreements also represent collateralized financing transactions similar to the resale and repurchase agreements collateral typically consists of government and governmentagency securities and corporate debt and equity securities 

similar to the resale and repurchase agreements securities borrowing and lending agreements are generally documented under industry standard agreements that allow the prompt closeout of all transactions including the liquidation of securities held and the offsetting of obligations to return cash or securities by the nondefaulting party following a payment default or other default by the other party under the relevant master agreement events of default and rights to use securities under the securities borrowing and lending agreements are similar to the resale and repurchase agreements referenced above 

a substantial portion of securities borrowing and lending agreements is recorded at the amount of cash advanced or received the remaining portion is recorded at fair value as citi elected the fair value option for certain securities borrowed and loaned portfolios as described in note 25  to the consolidated financial statements with respect to securities loaned citi receives cash collateral in an amount generally in excess of the market value of the securities loaned citi monitors the market value of securities borrowed and securities loaned on a daily basis and obtains or posts additional collateral in order to maintain contractual margin protection 

the enforceability of offsetting rights incorporated in the master netting agreements for resale and repurchase agreements and securities borrowing and lending agreements is evidenced to the extent that a supportive legal opinion has been obtained from counsel of recognized standing that provides the requisite level of certainty regarding the enforceability of these agreements also the exercise of rights by the nondefaulting party to terminate and closeout transactions on a net basis under these agreements will not be stayed or avoided under applicable law upon an event of default including bankruptcy insolvency or similar proceeding 

a legal opinion may not have been sought or obtained for certain jurisdictions where local law is silent or sufficiently ambiguous to determine the enforceability of offsetting rights or where adverse case law or conflicting regulation may cast doubt on the enforceability of such rights in some 

 

jurisdictions and for some counterparty types the insolvency law for a particular counterparty type may be nonexistent or unclear as overlapping regimes may exist for example this may be the case for certain sovereigns municipalities central banks and us pension plans 

the following tables present the gross and net resale and repurchase agreements and securities borrowing and lending 

agreements and the related offsetting amount permitted under asc 2102045 the tables also include amounts related to financial instruments that are not permitted to be offset under asc 2102045 but would be eligible for offsetting to the extent that an event of default occurred and a legal opinion supporting enforceability of the offsetting rights has been obtained remaining exposures continue to be secured by financial collateral but citi may not have sought or been able to obtain a legal opinion evidencing enforceability of the offsetting right 









 

the following tables present the gross amount of liabilities associated with repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements by remaining contractual maturity 





the following tables present the gross amount of liabilities associated with repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements by class of underlying collateral 





12 brokerage receivables and brokerage 

payables 

citi has receivables and payables for financial instruments sold to and purchased from brokers dealers and customers which arise in the ordinary course of business citi is exposed to risk of loss from the inability of brokers dealers or customers to pay for purchases or to deliver the financial instruments sold in which case citi would have to sell or purchase the financial instruments at prevailing market prices credit risk is reduced to the extent that an exchange or clearing organization acts as a counterparty to the transaction and replaces the broker dealer or customer in question 

citi seeks to protect itself from the risks associated with customer activities by requiring customers to maintain margin collateral in compliance with regulatory and internal guidelines margin levels are monitored daily and customers deposit additional collateral as required where customers cannot meet collateral requirements citi may liquidate sufficient underlying financial instruments to bring the customer into compliance with the required margin level 

exposure to credit risk is impacted by market volatility which may impair the ability of clients to satisfy their obligations to citi credit limits are established and closely monitored for customers and for brokers and dealers engaged in forwards futures and other transactions deemed to be credit sensitive 

brokerage receivables and brokerage payables  consisted of the following 





13 investments 

overview 

the following table presents citi’s investments by category 



 

the following table presents interest and dividend income on investments 



the following table presents realized gains and losses on the sale of investments which excludes losses from otherthantemporary impairment otti 



the company has sold certain debt securities that were classified as htm these sales were in response to significant deterioration in the creditworthiness of the issuers or securities or because the company has collected a substantial portion at least 85  of the principal outstanding at acquisition of the security in addition certain other securities were reclassified to afs investments in response to 

 

significant credit deterioration because the company generally intends to sell these reclassified securities citi recorded otti on the securities the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the carrying value of htm securities sold and reclassified to afs as well as the related gain loss or the otti losses recorded on these securities 



securities availableforsale 

the amortized cost and fair value of afs securities were as follows 



   

at december 31 2016  the amortized cost of approximately 4319  investments in equity and fixed income securities exceeded their fair value by 2566 million  of the 2566 million  the gross unrealized losses on equity securities were 6 million  of the remainder  1392 million  represented unrealized losses on fixed income investments that have been in a grossunrealizedloss position for less than a year and of these 98  were rated investment grade and  1168 million  represented unrealized losses on fixed income investments that have been in a grossunrealizedloss position for a year or more and of these 76  were rated investment grade of the  1168 million  mentioned above 702 million  represent state and municipal securities 

 

at december 31 2016  the afs mortgagebacked securities portfolio fair value balance of 42673 million   consisted of 38405 million  of governmentsponsored agency securities and  4268 million  of privately sponsored securities substantially all of which were backed by nonus residential mortgages 

as discussed in more detail below citi conducts periodic reviews of all securities with unrealized losses to evaluate whether the impairment is otherthantemporary for debt securities which citi plans to sell or morelikelythannot will be required to sell the entire impairment is recognized in the consolidated statement of income for those securities that the company does not intend to sell and is not likely to be required to sell only the creditrelated impairment is recognized in earnings and any noncreditrelated impairment is recorded in aoci 

the following table shows the fair value of afs securities that have been in an unrealized loss position 



the following table presents the amortized cost and fair value of afs debt securities by contractual maturity dates 



 

debt securities heldtomaturity 

the carrying value and fair value of debt securities htm were as follows 





 

the company has the positive intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity or where applicable the exercise of any issuer call options absent any unforeseen significant changes in circumstances including deterioration in credit or changes in regulatory capital requirements 

the net unrealized losses classified in aoci primarily relate to debt securities previously classified as afs that have been transferred to htm and include any cumulative fair 

 

value hedge adjustments the net unrealized loss amount also includes any noncreditrelated changes in fair value of htm securities that have suffered credit impairment recorded in earnings the aoci balance related to htm securities is amortized over the remaining contractual life of the related securities as an adjustment of yield in a manner consistent with the accretion of any difference between the carrying value at the transfer date and par value of the same debt securities 

the table below shows the fair value of debt securities htm that have been in an unrecognized loss position 



note excluded from the gross unrecognized losses presented in the above table are 496 million and 453 million of net unrealized losses recorded in aoci as of december 31 2016  and december 31 2015  respectively primarily related to the difference between the amortized cost and carrying value of htm securities that were reclassified from afs substantially all of these net unrecognized losses relate to securities that have been in a loss position for 12 months or longer at december 31 2016  and december 31 2015  

the following table presents the carrying value and fair value of htm debt securities by contractual maturity dates 

 

evaluating investments for otherthantemporary impairment 

overview 

the company conducts periodic reviews of all securities with unrealized losses to evaluate whether the impairment is otherthantemporary 

an unrealized loss exists when the current fair value of an individual security is less than its amortized cost basis unrealized losses that are determined to be temporary in nature are recorded net of tax in aoci for afs securities losses related to htm securities generally are not recorded as these investments are carried at adjusted amortized cost basis however for htm securities with creditrelated losses the credit loss is recognized in earnings as otti and any difference between the cost basis adjusted for the otti and fair value is recognized in aoci and amortized as an adjustment of yield over the remaining contractual life of the security for securities transferred to htm from trading account assets  amortized cost is defined as the fair value of the securities at the date of transfer plus any accretion income and less any impairment recognized in earnings subsequent to transfer for securities transferred to htm from afs amortized cost is defined as the original purchase cost adjusted for the cumulative accretion or amortization of any purchase discount or premium plus or minus any cumulative fair value hedge adjustments net of accretion or amortization and less any impairment recognized in earnings 

regardless of the classification of the securities as afs or htm the company assesses each position with an unrealized loss for otti factors considered in determining whether a loss is temporary include 

 

the company’s review for impairment generally entails 

 

 

debt securities 

the entire difference between amortized cost basis and fair value is recognized in earnings as otti for impaired debt securities that the company has an intent to sell or for which the company believes it will morelikelythannot be required to sell prior to recovery of the amortized cost basis however for those securities that the company does not intend to sell and is not likely to be required to sell only the creditrelated impairment is recognized in earnings and any noncreditrelated impairment is recorded in aoci 

for debt securities credit impairment exists where management does not expect to receive contractual principal and interest cash flows sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis of a security 

equity securities 

for equity securities management considers the various factors described above including its intent and ability to hold the equity security for a period of time sufficient for recovery to cost or whether it is morelikelythannot that the company will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its cost basis where management lacks that intent or ability the security’s decline in fair value is deemed to be otherthantemporary and is recorded in earnings afs equity securities deemed to be otherthantemporarily impaired are written down to fair value with the full difference between fair value and cost recognized in earnings 

management assesses equity method investments that have fair values that are less than their respective carrying values for otti fair value is measured as price multiplied by quantity if the investee has publicly listed securities if the investee is not publicly listed other methods are used see note 24  to the consolidated financial statements 

for impaired equity method investments that citi plans to sell prior to recovery of value or would likely be required to sell with no expectation that the fair value will recover prior to the expected sale date the full impairment is recognized in earnings as otti regardless of severity and duration the measurement of the otti does not include partial projected recoveries subsequent to the balance sheet date 

for impaired equity method investments that management does not plan to sell and is not likely to be required to sell prior to recovery of value the evaluation of whether an impairment is otherthantemporary is based on i whether and when an equity method investment will recover in value and ii whether the investor has the intent and ability to hold that investment for a period of time sufficient to recover the value the determination of whether the impairment is considered otherthantemporary considers the following indicators regardless of the time and extent of impairment 



 

the sections below describe the company’s process for identifying creditrelated impairments for security types that have the most significant unrealized losses as of december 31 2016  

mortgagebacked securities 

for us mortgagebacked securities and in particular for alta and other mortgagebacked securities that have significant unrealized losses as a percentage of amortized cost credit impairment is assessed using a cash flow model that estimates the principal and interest cash flows on the underlying mortgages using the securityspecific collateral and transaction structure the model distributes the estimated cash flows to the various tranches of securities considering the transaction structure and any subordination and credit enhancements that exist in that structure the cash flow model incorporates actual cash flows on the mortgagebacked securities through the current period and then estimates the remaining cash flows using a number of assumptions including default rates prepayment rates recovery rates on foreclosed properties and loss severity rates on nonagency mortgagebacked securities 

management develops specific assumptions using market data internal estimates and estimates published by rating agencies and other thirdparty sources default rates are projected by considering current underlying mortgage loan performance generally assuming the default of i 10  of current loans ii 25  of 30 – 59 day delinquent loans iii 70  of 60 – 90 day delinquent loans and iv 100  of 91  day delinquent loans these estimates are extrapolated along a default timing curve to estimate the total lifetime pool default 

 

rate other assumptions contemplate the actual collateral attributes including geographic concentrations rating actions and current market prices 

cash flow projections are developed using different stress test scenarios management evaluates the results of those stress tests including the severity of any cash shortfall indicated and the likelihood of the stress scenarios actually occurring based on the underlying pool’s characteristics and performance to assess whether management expects to recover the amortized cost basis of the security if cash flow projections indicate that the company does not expect to recover its amortized cost basis the company recognizes the estimated credit loss in earnings 

state and municipal securities 

the process for identifying credit impairments in citigroup’s afs and htm state and municipal bonds is primarily based on a credit analysis that incorporates thirdparty credit ratings citigroup monitors the bond issuers and any insurers providing default protection in the form of financial guarantee insurance the average external credit rating ignoring any insurance is aa3aa in the event of an external rating downgrade or other indicator of credit impairment ie based on instrumentspecific estimates of cash flows or probability of issuer default the subject bond is specifically reviewed for adverse changes in the amount or timing of expected contractual principal and interest payments 

for state and municipal bonds with unrealized losses that citigroup plans to sell for afs only would be morelikelythannot required to sell for afs only or will be subject to an issuer call deemed probable of exercise prior to the expected recovery of its amortized cost basis for afs and htm the full impairment is recognized in earnings

investments in alternative investment funds that calculate net asset value 

the company holds investments in certain alternative investment funds that calculate net asset value nav or its equivalent including hedge funds private equity funds funds of funds and real estate funds as provided by thirdparty asset managers investments in such funds are generally classified as nonmarketable equity securities carried at fair value the fair values of these investments are estimated using the nav of the company’s ownership interest in the funds some of these investments are in “covered funds” for purposes of the volcker rule which prohibits certain proprietary investment activities and limits the ownership of and relationships with covered funds the deadline for compliance with the volcker rule is july 21 2017 by which date citi is required to sell those of its investments in covered funds prohibited by the rule citi has submitted an application to request an extension of the permitted holding period for certain of its investments in illiquid funds subject to the volcker rule if an extension is not granted and such investments need to be divested the company may receive value that is lower than the reported nav for these investments 

 



 

14 loans 

citigroup loans are reported in two  categories—consumer and corporate these categories are classified primarily according to the segment and subsegment that manage the loans 

consumer loans 

consumer loans represent loans and leases managed primarily by gcb  in citicorp and in citi holdings the following table provides citi’s consumer loans by loan type 



 

citigroup has established a risk management process to monitor evaluate and manage the principal risks associated with its consumer loan portfolio credit quality indicators that are actively monitored include delinquency status consumer credit scores fico and loan to value ltv ratios each as discussed in more detail below 

included in the loan table above are lending products whose terms may give rise to greater credit issues credit cards with belowmarket introductory interest rates and interestonly loans are examples of such products these products are closely managed using credit techniques that are intended to mitigate their higher inherent risk 

during the years  ended december 31 2016  and 2015  the company sold andor reclassified to heldforsale 97 billion             and 258 billion  respectively of consumer loans 

 

delinquency status 

delinquency status is monitored and considered a key indicator of credit quality of consumer loans principally the us residential first mortgage loans use the mortgage bankers association mba method of reporting delinquencies which considers a loan delinquent if a monthly payment has not been received by the end of the day immediately preceding the loan’s next due date all other loans use a method of reporting delinquencies that considers a loan delinquent if a monthly payment has not been received by the close of business on the loan’s next due date 

as a general policy residential first mortgages home equity loans and installment loans are classified as nonaccrual when loan payments are 90 days  contractually past due credit cards and unsecured revolving loans generally accrue interest until payments are 180 days  past due home equity loans in regulated bank entities are classified as nonaccrual if the related residential first mortgage is 90 days  or more past due mortgage loans in regulated bank entities discharged through chapter 7 bankruptcy other than federal housing administration fhainsured loans are classified as nonaccrual commercial market loans are placed on a cash nonaccrual basis when it is determined based on actual experience and a forwardlooking assessment of the collectability of the loan in full that the payment of interest or principal is doubtful or when interest or principal is 90 days past due 

the policy for reaging modified us consumer loans to current status varies by product generally one of the conditions to qualify for these modifications is that a minimum number of payments typically ranging from one  to three  be made upon modification the loan is reaged to current status however reaging practices for certain openended consumer loans such as credit cards are governed by federal financial institutions examination council ffiec guidelines for openended consumer loans subject to ffiec guidelines one of the conditions for a loan to be reaged to current status is that at least three  consecutive minimum monthly payments or the equivalent amount must be received in addition under ffiec guidelines the number of times that such a loan can be reaged is subject to limitations generally once in 12 months and twice in five years furthermore fha and department of veterans affairs va loans are modified under those respective agencies’ guidelines and payments are not always required in order to reage a modified loan to current

consumer credit scores fico 

in the us independent credit agencies rate an individual’s risk for assuming debt based on the individual’s credit history and assign every consumer a “fico” fair isaac corporation credit score these scores are continually updated by the agencies based upon an individual’s credit actions eg taking out a loan or missed or late payments 

the following tables provide details on the fico scores for citi’s us consumer loan portfolio commercial market loans are excluded in the table since they are business based and fico scores are not a primary driver in their credit evaluation fico scores are updated monthly for substantially all of the portfolio or otherwise on a quarterly basis for the remaining portfolio 

 





 

loan to value ltv ratios 

ltv ratios loan balance divided by appraised value are calculated at origination and updated by applying market price data 

the following tables provide details on the ltv ratios for citi’s us consumer mortgage portfolios ltv ratios are updated monthly using the most recent core logic home price index data available for substantially all of the portfolio applied at the metropolitan statistical area level if available or the state level if not the remainder of the portfolio is updated in a similar manner using the federal housing finance agency indices 





 

 

impaired consumer loans 

impaired loans are those loans where citi believes it is probable all amounts due according to the original contractual terms of the loan will not be collected impaired consumer loans include nonaccrual commercial market loans as well as smallerbalance homogeneous loans whose terms have been modified due to the borrower’s financial difficulties and where citi has granted a concession to the borrower these modifications may include interest rate reductions andor principal forgiveness impaired consumer loans exclude smallerbalance homogeneous loans that have not been modified and are carried on a nonaccrual basis

the company sold andor reclassified to heldforsale 42 billion  and 28 billion  of corporate loans during the years  ended december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively the company did not have significant purchases of corporate loans classified as heldforinvestment for the years  ended december 31 2016  or 2015  

delinquency status 

citi generally does not manage corporate loans on a delinquency basis   corporate loans are identified as impaired and placed on a cash nonaccrual basis when it is determined based on actual experience and a forwardlooking assessment of the collectability of the loan in full that the payment of interest or principal is doubtful or when interest or principal is 90 days past due except when the loan is well collateralized and in the process of collection any interest accrued on impaired corporate loans and leases is reversed at 90 days  and charged against current earnings and interest is thereafter included in earnings only to the extent actually received in cash when there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectability of principal all cash receipts are thereafter applied to reduce the recorded investment in the loan while corporate loans are generally managed based on their internally assigned risk rating see further discussion below the following tables present delinquency information by corporate loan type

corporate loan delinquency and nonaccrual details at december 31 2015 

 

citigroup has a risk management process to monitor evaluate and manage the principal risks associated with its corporate loan portfolio as part of its risk management process citi assigns numeric risk ratings to its corporate loan facilities based on quantitative and qualitative assessments of the obligor and facility these risk ratings are reviewed at least annually or more often if material events related to the obligor or facility warrant factors considered in assigning the risk ratings include financial condition of the obligor qualitative assessment of management and strategy amount and sources of repayment amount and type of collateral and guarantee arrangements amount and type of any contingencies associated with the obligor and the obligor’s industry and geography 

the obligor risk ratings are defined by ranges of default probabilities the facility risk ratings are defined by ranges of loss norms which are the product of the probability of default and the loss given default the investment grade rating categories are similar to the category bbbbaa3 and above as defined by sp and moody’s loans classified according to the bank regulatory definitions as special mention substandard and doubtful will have risk ratings within the noninvestment grade categories 

 

corporate loans credit quality indicators

       during the fourth quarter of 2016 citigroup signed separate agreements for the sale of its argentina and brazil consumer businesses and allocated goodwill to these disposals which are now classified as heldforsale the disposed businesses represent a significant portion of the citi holdings— consumer   latin america  and therefore was considered a trigger event as a result an interim goodwill impairment test was performed during the quarter resulting in no impairment on the remaining reporting unit while there was no indication of impairment the 16 million  of goodwill present in citi holdings— consumer   latin america may be particularly sensitive to further 

deterioration in economic conditions the fair value as a percentage of allocated book value as of december 31 2016 was 107  

the fair values of the company’s reporting units exceeded their carrying values and did not indicate a risk of impairment based on current valuations

21 securitizations and variable interest entities 

  

uses of special purpose entities 

a special purpose entity spe is an entity designed to fulfill a specific limited need of the company that organized it the principal uses of spes by citi are to obtain liquidity and favorable capital treatment by securitizing certain financial assets to assist clients in securitizing their financial assets and to create investment products for clients spes may be organized in various legal forms including trusts partnerships or corporations in a securitization the company transferring assets to an spe converts all or a portion of those assets into cash before they would have been realized in the normal course of business through the spe’s issuance of debt and equity instruments certificates commercial paper or other notes of indebtedness these issuances are recorded on the balance sheet of the spe which may or may not be consolidated onto the balance sheet of the company that organized the spe 

investors usually have recourse only to the assets in the spe but may also benefit from other credit enhancements such as a collateral account a line of credit or a liquidity facility such as a liquidity put option or asset purchase agreement because of these enhancements the spe issuances typically obtain a more favorable credit rating than the transferor could obtain for its own debt issuances this results in less expensive financing costs than unsecured debt the spe may also enter into derivative contracts in order to convert the yield or currency of the underlying assets to match the needs of the spe investors or to limit or change the credit risk of the spe citigroup may be the provider of certain credit enhancements as well as the counterparty to any related derivative contracts 

most of citigroup’s spes are variable interest entities vies as described below 

  

variable interest entities 

vies are entities that have either a total equity investment that is insufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or whose equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest ie ability to make significant decisions through voting rights or similar rights and a right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity or an obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity investors that finance the vie through debt or equity interests or other counterparties providing other forms of support such as guarantees certain fee arrangements or certain types of derivative contracts are variable interest holders in the entity 

 

the variable interest holder if any that has a controlling financial interest in a vie is deemed to be the primary beneficiary and must consolidate the vie citigroup would be deemed to have a controlling financial interest and be the primary beneficiary if it has both of the following characteristics 

 

the company must evaluate each vie to understand the purpose and design of the entity the role the company had in the entity’s design and its involvement in the vie’s ongoing activities the company then must evaluate which activities most significantly impact the economic performance of the vie and who has the power to direct such activities 

for those vies where the company determines that it has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the vie’s economic performance the company must then evaluate its economic interests if any and determine whether it could absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the vie when evaluating whether the company has an obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant it considers the maximum exposure to such loss without consideration of probability such obligations could be in various forms including but not limited to debt and equity investments guarantees liquidity agreements and certain derivative contracts 

in various other transactions the company may i act as a derivative counterparty for example interest rate swap crosscurrency swap or purchaser of credit protection under a credit default swap or total return swap where the company pays the total return on certain assets to the spe ii act as underwriter or placement agent iii provide administrative trustee or other services or iv make a market in debt securities or other instruments issued by vies the company generally considers such involvement by itself not to be variable interests and thus not an indicator of power or potentially significant benefits or losses 

citigroup’s involvement with consolidated and unconsolidated vies with which the company holds significant variable interests or has continuing involvement through servicing a majority of the assets in a vie is presented below 



note certain adjustments have been made to the december 31 2015  information to conform to the current period’s presentation 

 

the previous tables do not include 

 

 

the asset balances for consolidated vies represent the carrying amounts of the assets consolidated by the company the carrying amount may represent the amortized cost or the current fair value of the assets depending on the legal form of the asset eg loan or security and the company’s standard accounting policies for the asset type and line of business 

the asset balances for unconsolidated vies where the company has significant involvement represent the most current information available to the company in most cases the asset balances represent an amortized cost basis without regard to impairments unless fair value information is readily available to the company 

the maximum funded exposure represents the balance sheet carrying amount of the company’s investment in the vie it reflects the initial amount of cash invested in the vie adjusted for any accrued interest and cash principal payments received the carrying amount may also be adjusted for increases or declines in fair value or any impairment in value recognized in earnings the maximum exposure of unfunded positions represents the remaining undrawn committed amount including liquidity and credit facilities provided by the company or the notional amount of a derivative instrument considered to be a variable interest in certain transactions the company has entered into derivative instruments or other arrangements that are not considered variable interests in the vie eg interest rate swaps crosscurrency swaps or where the company is the purchaser of credit protection under a credit default swap or total return swap where the company pays the total return on certain assets to the spe receivables under such arrangements are not included in the maximum exposure amounts 

funding commitments for significant unconsolidated vies—liquidity facilities and loan commitments 

the following table presents the notional amount of liquidity facilities and loan commitments that are classified as funding commitments in the vie tables above 



consolidated vies 

the company engages in onbalance sheet securitizations which are securitizations that do not qualify for sales treatment thus the assets remain on the company’s consolidated balance sheet and any proceeds received are recognized as secured liabilities the consolidated vies represent hundreds of separate entities with which the company is involved in general the thirdparty investors in the obligations of consolidated vies have legal recourse only to the assets of the respective vies and do not have such recourse to the company except where the company has 

provided a guarantee to the investors or is the counterparty to 

 

certain derivative transactions involving the vie thus the company’s maximum legal exposure to loss related to consolidated vies is significantly less than the carrying value of the consolidated vie assets due to outstanding thirdparty financing intercompany assets and liabilities are excluded from citi’s consolidated balance sheet all vie assets are restricted from being sold or pledged as collateral the cash flows from these assets are the only source used to pay down the associated liabilities which are nonrecourse to the company’s general assets see the consolidated balance sheet for more information about these consolidated vie assets and liabilities 

significant interests in unconsolidated vies—balance sheet classification 

the following table presents the carrying amounts and classification of significant variable interests in unconsolidated vies 



credit card securitizations 

the company securitizes credit card receivables through trusts established to purchase the receivables citigroup transfers receivables into the trusts on a nonrecourse basis credit card securitizations are revolving securitizations as customers pay their credit card balances the cash proceeds are used to purchase new receivables and replenish the receivables in the trust 

substantially all of the company’s credit card securitization activity is through two  trusts—citibank credit card master trust master trust and the citibank omni master trust omni trust with the substantial majority through the master trust these trusts are consolidated 

 

entities because as servicer citigroup has the power to direct 

the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the trusts citigroup holds a seller’s interest and certain securities issued by the trusts which could result in exposure to potentially significant losses or benefits from the trusts accordingly the transferred credit card receivables remain on citi’s consolidated balance sheet with no  gain or loss recognized the debt issued by the trusts to third parties is included on citi’s consolidated balance sheet 

the company utilizes securitizations as one of the sources of funding for its business in north america  the following table reflects amounts related to the company’s securitized credit card receivables 



the following table summarizes selected cash flow information related to citigroup’s credit card securitizations 



managed loans 

after securitization of credit card receivables the company continues to maintain credit card customer account relationships and provides servicing for receivables transferred to the trusts as a result the company considers the securitized credit card receivables to be part of the business it manages as citigroup consolidates the credit card trusts all managed securitized card receivables are onbalance sheet 

funding liquidity facilities and subordinated interests 

as noted above citigroup securitizes credit card receivables through two  securitization trusts—master trust and omni trust the liabilities of the trusts are included in the consolidated balance sheet excluding those retained by citigroup 

  

 

the master trust issues fixed and floatingrate term notes some of the term notes may be issued to multiseller commercial paper conduits the weighted average maturity of 

the term notes issued by the master trust was 26 years  as of december 31 2016  and 24 years  as of december 31 2015  

master trust liabilities at par value 



the omni trust issues fixed and floatingrate term notes some of which are purchased by multiseller commercial paper conduits the weighted average maturity of the thirdparty term notes issued by the omni trust was 19 years  as of december 31 2016  and 09 years  as of december 31 2015  

omni trust liabilities at par value 



mortgage securitizations 

the company provides a wide range of mortgage loan products to a diverse customer base once originated the company often securitizes these loans through the use of vies these vies are funded through the issuance of trust certificates backed solely by the transferred assets these certificates have the same life as the transferred assets in addition to providing a source of liquidity and less expensive funding securitizing these assets also reduces the company’s credit exposure to the borrowers these mortgage loan securitizations are primarily nonrecourse thereby effectively transferring the risk of future credit losses to the purchasers of the securities issued by the trust however the company’s us consumer mortgage business generally retains the servicing rights and in certain instances retains investment securities interestonly strips and residual interests in future cash flows from the trusts and also provides servicing for a limited number of icg  securitizations 

the company securitizes mortgage loans generally through either a governmentsponsored agency such as ginnie mae fannie mae or freddie mac us agencysponsored mortgages or privatelabel nonagencysponsored mortgages securitization the company is not the primary beneficiary of its us agencysponsored mortgage 

 

securitizations because citigroup does not have the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance therefore citi does not consolidate these us agencysponsored mortgage securitizations substantially all of the consumer loans sold or securitized through nonconsolidated trusts by citigroup are us prime residential mortgage loans retained interests in nonconsolidated mortgage securitization trusts are classified as trading account assets  except for msrs which are included in mortgage servicing rights  on citigroup’s consolidated balance sheet 

the company does not consolidate certain nonagencysponsored mortgage securitizations because citi is either not the servicer with the power to direct the significant activities of the entity or citi is the servicer but the servicing relationship is deemed to be a fiduciary relationship therefore citi is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the entity 

in certain instances the company has i the power to direct the activities and ii the obligation to either absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could be potentially significant to its nonagencysponsored mortgage securitizations and therefore is the primary beneficiary and thus consolidates the vie 

the following table summarizes selected cash flow information related to citigroup mortgage securitizations 



1 the proceeds from new securitizations in 2016  and 2015  include 05 billion  and 07 billion  respectively related to personal loan securitizations 

agency and nonagency securitization gains for the year ended december 31 2016  were 105 million  and 107 million  respectively 

 

agency and nonagency securitization gains for the year ended december 31 2015  were 149 million  and 41 million  respectively and 214 million  and 53 million  respectively for the year ended december 31 2014  

key assumptions used in measuring the fair value of retained interests at the date of sale or securitization of mortgage receivables were as follows 



note citi held no retained interests in nonagencysponsored mortgages securitized during 2016  



 

the interests retained by the company range from highly rated andor senior in the capital structure to unrated andor residual interests

note there were no  subordinated interests in mortgage securitizations in citi holdings as of december 31 2016  and 2015  

 

mortgage servicing rights 

in connection with the securitization of mortgage loans the company’s us consumer mortgage business generally retains the servicing rights which entitle the company to a future stream of cash flows based on the outstanding principal balances of the loans and the contractual servicing fee failure to service the loans in accordance with contractual requirements may lead to a termination of the servicing rights and the loss of future servicing fees 

these transactions create an intangible asset referred to as mortgage servicing rights msrs which are recorded at fair value on citi’s consolidated balance sheet the fair value of citi’s capitalized msrs was 16 billion  and 18 billion  at december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively the msrs correspond to principal loan balances of 168 billion  and 198 billion  as of december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively the following table summarizes the changes in capitalized msrs 

 





the fair value of the msrs is primarily affected by changes in prepayments of mortgages that result from shifts in mortgage interest rates specifically higher interest rates tend to lead to declining prepayments which causes the fair value of the msrs to increase in managing this risk the company economically hedges a significant portion of the value of its msrs through the use of interest rate derivative contracts forward purchase and sale commitments of mortgagebacked securities and purchased securities all classified as trading account assets  the company receives fees during the course of servicing previously securitized mortgages the amounts of these fees were as follows 



in the consolidated statement of income these fees are primarily classified as commissions and fees and changes in msr fair values are classified as other revenue  

in january 2017 citi signed agreements to effectively exit its us mortgage servicing operations by the end of 2018 and intensify its focus on loan originations for additional information on these transactions see note 29 to the consolidated financial statements 

resecuritizations 

the company engages in resecuritization transactions in which debt securities are transferred to a vie in exchange for new beneficial interests citi did not transfer nonagency privatelabel securities to resecuritization entities during the year ended december 31 2016  during the year ended december 31 2015  citi transferred nonagency privatelabel securities with an original par value of 885 million  to resecuritization entities these securities are backed by either residential or commercial mortgages and are often structured on behalf of clients 

as of december 31 2016  the fair value of citiretained interests in privatelabel resecuritization transactions structured by citi totaled approximately 126 million  all related to resecuritization transactions prior to 2016  which has been recorded in trading account assets  of this amount substantially all was related to subordinated beneficial interests as of december 31 2015  the fair value of citiretained interests in privatelabel resecuritization transactions structured by citi totaled approximately 428 million  including 132 million  related to resecuritization transactions executed in 2015  of this amount approximately 18 million  was related to senior beneficial interests and approximately 410 million  was related to subordinated beneficial interests the original par value of privatelabel resecuritization transactions in which citi holds a retained interest as of december 31 2016  and 2015  was approximately 13 billion  and 37 billion  respectively 

the company also resecuritizes us governmentagency guaranteed mortgagebacked agency securities during the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  citi transferred agency securities with a fair value of approximately 239 

 

billion  and 178 billion  respectively to resecuritization entities 

as of december 31 2016  the fair value of citiretained interests in agency resecuritization transactions structured by citi totaled approximately 23 billion  including 741 million  related to resecuritization transactions executed in 2016  compared to 18 billion  as of december 31 2015  including 15 billion  related to resecuritization transactions executed in 2015  which is recorded in trading account assets  the original fair value of agency resecuritization transactions in which citi holds a retained interest as of december 31 2016  and 2015  was approximately 718 billion  and 650 billion  respectively 

as of december 31 2016  and 2015  the company did not consolidate any privatelabel or agency resecuritization entities 

citiadministered assetbacked commercial paper conduits 

the company is active in the assetbacked commercial paper conduit business as administrator of several multiseller commercial paper conduits and also as a service provider to singleseller and other commercial paper conduits sponsored by third parties 

citi’s multiseller commercial paper conduits are designed to provide the company’s clients access to lowcost funding in the commercial paper markets the conduits purchase assets from or provide financing facilities to clients and are funded by issuing commercial paper to thirdparty investors the conduits generally do not purchase assets originated by the company the funding of the conduits is facilitated by the liquidity support and credit enhancements provided by the company 

as administrator to citi’s conduits the company is generally responsible for selecting and structuring assets purchased or financed by the conduits making decisions regarding the funding of the conduits including determining the tenor and other features of the commercial paper issued monitoring the quality and performance of the conduits’ assets and facilitating the operations and cash flows of the conduits in return the company earns structuring fees from customers for individual transactions and earns an administration fee from the conduit which is equal to the income from the client program and liquidity fees of the conduit after payment of conduit expenses this administration fee is fairly stable since most risks and rewards of the underlying assets are passed back to the clients once the asset pricing is negotiated most ongoing income costs and fees are relatively stable as a percentage of the conduit’s size 

the conduits administered by the company do not generally invest in liquid securities that are formally rated by third parties the assets are privately negotiated and structured transactions that are generally designed to be held by the conduit rather than actively traded and sold the yield earned by the conduit on each asset is generally tied to the rate on the commercial paper issued by the conduit thus passing interest rate risk to the client each asset purchased by the conduit is structured with transactionspecific credit enhancement features provided by the thirdparty client seller including over collateralization cash and excess spread collateral accounts direct recourse or thirdparty guarantees these 

credit enhancements are sized with the objective of approximating a credit rating of a or above based on the company’s internal risk ratings at december 31 2016  and 2015  the conduits had approximately 197 billion  and 213 billion  of purchased assets outstanding respectively and had incremental funding commitments with clients of approximately 128 billion  and 116 billion  respectively 

substantially all of the funding of the conduits is in the form of shortterm commercial paper at december 31 2016  and 2015  the weighted average remaining lives of the commercial paper issued by the conduits were approximately 55  and 56 days  respectively 

the primary credit enhancement provided to the conduit investors is in the form of transactionspecific credit enhancements described above in addition to the transactionspecific credit enhancements the conduits other than the government guaranteed loan conduit have obtained a letter of credit from the company which is equal to at least 8  to 10  of the conduit’s assets with a minimum of 200 million  the letters of credit provided by the company to the conduits total approximately 18 billion  as of december 31 2016  and 2015  the net result across multiseller conduits administered by the company other than the government guaranteed loan conduit is that in the event defaulted assets exceed the transactionspecific credit enhancements described above any losses in each conduit are allocated first to the company and then the commercial paper investors 

the company also provides the conduits with two  forms of liquidity agreements that are used to provide funding to the conduits in the event of a market disruption among other events each asset of the conduits is supported by a transactionspecific liquidity facility in the form of an asset purchase agreement apa under the apa the company has generally agreed to purchase nondefaulted eligible receivables from the conduit at par the apa is not designed to provide credit support to the conduit as it generally does not permit the purchase of defaulted or impaired assets any funding under the apa will likely subject the underlying conduit clients to increased interest costs in addition the company provides the conduits with programwide liquidity in the form of shortterm lending commitments under these commitments the company has agreed to lend to the conduits in the event of a shortterm disruption in the commercial paper market subject to specified conditions the company receives fees for providing both types of liquidity agreements and considers these fees to be on fair market terms 

finally the company is one of several named dealers in the commercial paper issued by the conduits and earns a marketbased fee for providing such services along with thirdparty dealers the company makes a market in the commercial paper and may from time to time fund commercial paper pending sale to a third party on specific dates with less liquidity in the market the company may hold in inventory commercial paper issued by conduits administered by the company as well as conduits administered by third parties separately in the normal course of business the company purchases commercial paper including commercial paper issued by the companys conduits at december 31 2016  and 2015  the company owned 97 billion  and 114 billion  respectively of the commercial paper issued by its 

 

administered conduits the companys purchases were not driven by market illiquidity and other than the amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules the company is not obligated under any agreement to purchase the commercial paper issued by the conduits 

the assetbacked commercial paper conduits are consolidated by the company the company has determined that through its roles as administrator and liquidity provider it has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities’ economic performance these powers include its ability to structure and approve the assets purchased by the conduits its ongoing surveillance and credit mitigation activities its ability to sell or repurchase assets out of the conduits and its liability management in addition as a result of all the company’s involvement described above it was concluded that the company has an economic interest that could potentially be significant however the assets and liabilities of the conduits are separate and apart from those of citigroup no assets of any conduit are available to satisfy the creditors of citigroup or any of its other subsidiaries 

collateralized loan obligations 

a collateralized loan obligation clo is a vie that purchases a portfolio of assets consisting primarily of noninvestment grade corporate loans clos issue multiple tranches of debt and equity to investors to fund the asset purchases and pay upfront expenses associated with forming the clo a thirdparty asset manager is contracted by the clo to purchase the underlying assets from the open market and monitor the credit risk associated with those assets over the term of a clo the asset manager directs purchases and sales of assets in a manner consistent with the clo’s asset management agreement and indenture in general the clo asset manager will have the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the economic performance of the clo investors in a clo through their ownership of debt andor equity in the clo can also direct certain activities of the clo including removing the clo asset manager under limited circumstances optionally redeeming the notes voting on amendments to the clo’s operating documents and other activities a clo has a finite life typically 12 years  

citi serves as a structuring and placement agent with respect to the clos typically the debt and equity of the clos are sold to thirdparty investors on occasion certain citi entities may purchase some portion of a clo’s liabilities for investment purposes in addition citi may purchase typically in the secondary market certain securities issued by the clos to support its market making activities 

the company does not generally have the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the economic performance of the clos as this power is generally held by a thirdparty asset manager of the clo as such those clos are not consolidated 

key assumptions and retained interests 

the key assumptions used to value retained interests in clos and the sensitivity of the fair value to adverse changes of 10 and 20 are set forth in the tables below 





assetbased financing 

the company provides loans and other forms of financing to vies that hold assets those loans are subject to the same credit approvals as all other loans originated or purchased by the company financings in the form of debt securities or derivatives are in most circumstances reported in trading account assets  and accounted for at fair value through earnings the company generally does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact these vies’ economic performance thus it does not consolidate them 

the primary types of citi’s assetbased financings total assets of the unconsolidated vies with significant involvement and citi’s maximum exposure to loss are shown below for citi to realize the maximum loss the vie borrower would have to default with no recovery from the assets held by the vie 





 

the following table summarizes selected cash flow information related to assetbased financings 



there were no  gains recognized on the securitizations of assetbased financings for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  

municipal securities tender option bond tob trusts 

municipal tob trusts may hold fixed or floatingrate taxable or taxexempt securities issued by state and local governments and municipalities tob trusts are typically structured as singleissuer entities whose assets are purchased from either the company or from other investors in the municipal securities market tob trusts finance the purchase of their municipal assets by issuing two  classes of certificates longdated floating rate certificates “floaters” that are putable pursuant to a liquidity facility and residual interest certificates “residuals” the floaters are purchased by thirdparty investors typically taxexempt money market funds the residuals are purchased by the original owner of the municipal securities that are being financed 

from the company’s perspective there are two  types of tob trusts customer tob trusts and noncustomer tob trusts customer tob trusts are those trusts utilized by customers of the company to finance their municipal securities investments the residuals issued by these trusts are purchased by the customer being financed noncustomer tob trusts are trusts that are used by the company to finance its own municipal securities investments the residuals issued by noncustomer tob trusts are purchased by the company 

with respect to both customer and noncustomer tob trusts the company may provide remarketing agent services if floaters are optionally tendered and the company in its role as remarketing agent is unable to find a new investor to purchase the optionally tendered floaters within a specified period of time the company may but is not obligated to purchase the tendered floaters into its own inventory the level of the company’s inventory of such floaters fluctuates 

for certain customer tob trusts the company may also serve as a voluntary advance provider in this capacity the company may but is not obligated to make loan advances to customer tob trusts to purchase optionally tendered floaters that have not otherwise been successfully remarketed to new investors such loans are secured by pledged floaters as of december 31 2016  the company had no outstanding voluntary advances to customer tob trusts 

for certain noncustomer trusts the company also provides credit enhancement approximately 82 million  of the municipal bonds owned by noncustomer tob trusts were subject to a credit guarantee provided by the company at both december 31 2016  and 2015  

the company also provides liquidity services to many customer and noncustomer trusts if a trust is unwound early due to an event other than a credit event on the underlying municipal bonds the underlying municipal bonds are sold out 

of the trust and bond sale proceeds are used to redeem the outstanding trust certificates if this results in a shortfall between the bond sale proceeds and the redemption price of the tendered floaters the company pursuant to the liquidity agreement would be obligated to make a payment to the trust to satisfy that shortfall for certain customer tob trusts the company has also executed a reimbursement agreement with the holder of the residual pursuant to which the residual holder is obligated to reimburse the company for any payment the company makes under the liquidity arrangement these reimbursement agreements may be subject to daily margining based on changes in the market value of the underlying municipal bonds in cases where a third party provides liquidity to a noncustomer tob trust a similar reimbursement arrangement may be executed whereby the company or a consolidated subsidiary of the company as residual holder would absorb any losses incurred by the liquidity provider 

for certain other noncustomer tob trusts the company serves as tender option provider the tender option provider arrangement allows floater holders to put their interests directly to the company at any time subject to the requisite notice period requirements at a price of par 

at december 31 2016  and 2015  liquidity agreements provided with respect to customer tob trusts totaled 29 billion  and 31 billion  respectively of which 21 billion  and 22 billion  respectively were offset by reimbursement agreements for the remaining exposure related to tob transactions where the residual owned by the customer was at least 25  of the bond value at the inception of the transaction no reimbursement agreement was executed 

the company considers both customer and noncustomer tob trusts to be vies customer tob trusts are not consolidated by the company as the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the trust’s economic performance rests with the customer residual holder which may unilaterally cause the sale of the trust’s bonds 

noncustomer tob trusts generally are consolidated because the company holds the residual interest and thus has the unilateral power to cause the sale of the trust’s bonds 

the company also provides other liquidity agreements or letters of credit to customersponsored municipal investment funds which are not variable interest entities and municipalityrelated issuers that totaled 74 billion  and 81 billion  as of december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively these liquidity agreements and letters of credit are offset by reimbursement agreements with various termout provisions 

 

municipal investments 

municipal investment transactions include debt and equity interests in partnerships that finance the construction and rehabilitation of lowincome housing facilitate lending in new or underserved markets or finance the construction or operation of renewable municipal energy facilities the company generally invests in these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits and grants earned from the investments made by the partnership the company may also provide construction loans or permanent loans for the development or operation of real estate properties held by partnerships these entities are generally considered vies the power to direct the activities of these entities is typically held by the general partner accordingly these entities are not consolidated by the company 

client intermediation 

client intermediation transactions represent a range of transactions designed to provide investors with specified returns based on the returns of an underlying security referenced asset or index these transactions include creditlinked notes and equitylinked notes in these transactions the vie typically obtains exposure to the underlying security referenced asset or index through a derivative instrument such as a totalreturn swap or a creditdefault swap in turn the vie issues notes to investors that pay a return based on the specified underlying security referenced asset or index the vie invests the proceeds in a financial asset or a guaranteed insurance contract that serves as collateral for the derivative contract over the term of the transaction the company’s involvement in these transactions includes being the counterparty to the vie’s derivative instruments and investing in a portion of the notes issued by the vie in certain transactions the investor’s maximum risk of loss is limited and the company absorbs risk of loss above a specified level the company does not have the power to direct the activities of the vies that most significantly impact their economic performance and thus it does not consolidate them 

the company’s maximum risk of loss in these transactions is defined as the amount invested in notes issued by the vie and the notional amount of any risk of loss absorbed by the company through a separate instrument issued by the vie the derivative instrument held by the company may generate a receivable from the vie for example where the company purchases credit protection from the vie in connection with the vie’s issuance of a creditlinked note which is collateralized by the assets owned by the vie these derivative instruments are not considered variable interests and any associated receivables are not included in the calculation of maximum exposure to the vie 

the proceeds from new securitizations related to the company’s client intermediation transactions for the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  totaled approximately 23 billion  and 20 billion  respectively 

investment funds 

the company is the investment manager for certain investment funds and retirement funds that invest in various asset classes including private equity hedge funds real estate fixed income and infrastructure the company earns a management fee which is a percentage of capital under management and may earn performance fees in addition for some of these funds the company has an ownership interest in the investment funds the company has also established a number of investment funds as opportunities for qualified employees to invest in private equity investments the company acts as investment manager to these funds and may provide employees with financing on both recourse and nonrecourse bases for a portion of the employees’ investment commitments 

prior to january 1 2016 the company determined that a majority of the investment entities managed by citigroup were provided a deferral from the requirements of asc 810 because they met the criteria in asu no 201010 consolidation topic 810 amendments for certain investment funds as part of the amended guidance under asu 201502 consolidation topic 810 amendments to the consolidation analysis  effective january 1 2016 these entities were evaluated and the company determined that these entities continue to meet the definition of a vie because the limited partners in the fund do not have the ability to remove the company as investment manager the company is considered the primary beneficiary and consolidates those vie entities where it has both the power to direct the activities and a potentially significant variable interest 

 22 derivatives activities 

in the ordinary course of business citigroup enters into various types of derivative transactions these derivative 

transactions include   

 

swaps forwards and some option contracts are overthecounter otc derivatives that are bilaterally negotiated with counterparties and settled with those counterparties except for swap contracts that are novated and cleared through central counterparties ccps futures contracts and other option contracts are standardized contracts that are traded on an exchange with a ccp as the counterparty from the inception of the transaction citigroup enters into derivative contracts relating to interest rate foreign currency commodity and other marketcredit risks for the following reasons 



 

exchange contracts are used to hedge nonusdollardenominated debt foreigncurrencydenominated afs securities and net investment exposures 

derivatives may expose citigroup to market credit or liquidity risks in excess of the amounts recorded on the consolidated balance sheet market risk on a derivative product is the exposure created by potential fluctuations in interest rates market prices foreign exchange rates and other factors and is a function of the type of product the volume of transactions the tenor and terms of the agreement and the underlying volatility credit risk is the exposure to loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to satisfy a derivative liability where the value of any collateral held by citi is not adequate to cover such losses the recognition in earnings of unrealized gains on derivative transactions is subject to management’s assessment of the probability of counterparty default liquidity risk is the potential exposure that arises when the size of a derivative position may affect the ability to monetize the position in a reasonable period of time and at a reasonable cost in periods of high volatility and financial stress 

derivative transactions are customarily documented under industry standard master netting agreements that provide that following an event of default the nondefaulting party may promptly terminate all transactions between the parties and determine the net amount due to be paid to or by the defaulting party events of default include i failure to make a payment on a derivatives transaction that remains uncured following applicable notice and grace periods ii breach of agreement that remains uncured after applicable notice and grace periods iii breach of a representation iv cross default either to thirdparty debt or to other derivative transactions entered into between the parties or in some cases their affiliates v the occurrence of a merger or consolidation which results in a party’s becoming a materially weaker credit and vi the cessation or repudiation of any applicable guarantee or other credit support document obligations under master netting agreements are often secured by collateral posted under an industry standard credit support annex to the master netting agreement an event of default may also occur under a credit support annex if a party fails to make a collateral delivery that remains uncured following applicable notice and grace periods 

the netting and collateral rights incorporated in the master netting agreements are considered to be legally enforceable if a supportive legal opinion has been obtained from counsel of recognized standing that provides the requisite level of certainty regarding enforceability and that the exercise of rights by the nondefaulting party to terminate and closeout transactions on a net basis under these agreements will not be stayed or avoided under applicable law upon an event of default including bankruptcy insolvency or similar proceeding 

a legal opinion may not be sought for certain jurisdictions where local law is silent or unclear as to the enforceability of such rights or where adverse case law or conflicting regulation may cast doubt on the enforceability of such rights in some jurisdictions and for some counterparty types the insolvency 

law may not provide the requisite level of certainty for example this may be the case for certain sovereigns municipalities central banks and us pension plans 

exposure to credit risk on derivatives is affected by market volatility which may impair the ability of counterparties to satisfy their obligations to the company credit limits are established and closely monitored for customers engaged in derivatives transactions citi considers the level of legal certainty regarding enforceability of its offsetting rights under master netting agreements and credit support annexes to be an important factor in its risk management process specifically citi generally transacts much lower volumes of derivatives under master netting agreements where citi does not have the requisite level of legal certainty regarding enforceability because such derivatives consume greater amounts of single counterparty credit limits than those executed under enforceable master netting agreements 

cash collateral and security collateral in the form of g10 government debt securities is often posted by a party to a master netting agreement to secure the net open exposure of the other party the receiving party is free to comminglerehypothecate such collateral in the ordinary course of its business nonstandard collateral such as corporate bonds municipal bonds us agency securities andor mbs may also be pledged as collateral for derivative transactions security collateral posted to open and maintain a master netting agreement with a counterparty in the form of cash andor securities may from time to time be segregated in an account at a thirdparty custodian pursuant to a triparty account control agreement 

information pertaining to citigroup’s derivative activities based on notional amounts is presented in the table below derivative notional amounts are reference amounts from which contractual payments are derived and do not represent a complete and accurate measure of citi’s exposure to derivative transactions rather citi’s derivative exposure arises primarily from market fluctuations ie market risk counterparty failure ie credit risk andor periods of high volatility or financial stress ie liquidity risk as well as any market valuation adjustments that may be required on the 

 

 transactions moreover notional amounts do not reflect the netting of offsetting trades for example if citi enters into a receivefixed interest rate swap with 100 million  notional and offsets this risk with an identical but opposite payfixed position with a different counterparty 200 million  in derivative notionals is reported although these offsetting positions may result in de minimis overall market risk aggregate derivative notional amounts can fluctuate from period to period in the normal course of business based on citi’s market share levels of client activity and other factors

the following tables present the gross and net fair values of the company’s derivative transactions and the related offsetting amounts as of december 31 2016  and december 31 2015  gross positive fair values are offset against gross negative fair values by counterparty pursuant to enforceable master netting agreements under asc 8151045 payables and receivables in respect of cash collateral received from or paid to a given counterparty pursuant to a credit support annex are included in the offsetting amount if a legal opinion supporting the enforceability of netting and collateral rights has been obtained gaap does not permit similar offsetting for security collateral the tables also present amounts that are not permitted to be offset such as security collateral or cash collateral posted at thirdparty custodians but which would be eligible for offsetting to the extent an event of default occurred and a legal opinion supporting enforceability of the netting and collateral rights has been obtained

for the years ended   december 31 2016  2015  and 2014 the amounts recognized in principal transactions  in the consolidated statement of income related to derivatives not designated in a qualifying hedging relationship as well as the underlying nonderivative instruments are presented in note 6  to the consolidated financial statements citigroup presents this disclosure by business classification showing derivative gains and losses related to its trading activities together with gains and losses related to nonderivative instruments within the same trading portfolios as this represents the way these portfolios are risk managed 

the amounts recognized in other revenue  in the consolidated statement of income related to derivatives not designated in a qualifying hedging relationship are shown below the table below does not include any offsetting gainslosses on the economically hedged items to the extent such amounts are also recorded in other revenue  



accounting for derivative hedging 

citigroup accounts for its hedging activities in accordance with asc 815 derivatives and hedging  as a general rule hedge accounting is permitted where the company is exposed to a particular risk such as interest rate or foreign exchange risk that causes changes in the fair value of an asset or liability or variability in the expected future cash flows of an existing asset liability or a forecasted transaction that may affect earnings 

derivative contracts hedging the risks associated with changes in fair value are referred to as fair value hedges while contracts hedging the variability of expected future cash flows are cash flow hedges hedges that utilize derivatives or debt instruments to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with equity investments in nonusdollarfunctionalcurrency foreign subsidiaries net investment in a foreign operation are net investment hedges 

 

to qualify as an accounting hedge under the hedge accounting rules versus an economic hedge where hedge accounting is not applied a hedging relationship must be highly effective in offsetting the risk designated as being hedged the hedge relationship must be formally documented at inception detailing the particular risk management objective and strategy for the hedge this includes the item and risks being hedged the hedging instrument being used and how effectiveness will be assessed the effectiveness of these hedging relationships is evaluated at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis both on a retrospective and prospective basis typically using quantitative measures of correlation with hedge ineffectiveness measured and recorded in current earnings hedge effectiveness assessment methodologies are performed in a similar manner for similar hedges and are used consistently throughout the hedging relationships the assessment of effectiveness may exclude changes in the value of the hedged item that are unrelated to the risks being hedged and the changes in fair value of the derivative associated with time value these excluded items are recognized in current earnings for the hedging derivative while changes in the value of a hedged item that are not related to the hedged risk are not recorded 

discontinued hedge accounting 

a hedging instrument must be highly effective in accomplishing the hedge objective of offsetting either changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item for the risk being hedged management may voluntarily dedesignate an accounting hedge at any time but if a hedge relationship is not highly effective it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting and must be dedesignated subsequent changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognized in other revenue  or principal transactions  similar to trading derivatives with no offset recorded related to the hedged item 

for fair value hedges any changes in the fair value of the hedged item remain as part of the basis of the asset or liability and are ultimately realized as an element of the yield on the item for cash flow hedges changes in fair value of the enduser derivative remain in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  aoci and are included in the earnings of future periods when the forecasted hedged cash flows impact earnings however if it becomes probable that some or all of the hedged forecasted transactions will not occur any amounts 

that remain in aoci   related to these transactions must be immediately reflected in other revenue  

the foregoing criteria are applied on a decentralized basis consistent with the level at which market risk is managed but are subject to various limits and controls the underlying asset liability or forecasted transaction may be an individual item or a portfolio of similar items 

fair value hedges 

hedging of benchmark interest rate risk 

citigroup’s fair value hedges are primarily hedges of fixedrate longterm debt or assets such as availableforsale securities 

citigroup hedges exposure to changes in the fair value of outstanding fixedrate issued debt these hedges are designated as fair value hedges of the benchmark interest rate risk associated with the currency of the hedged liability the fixed cash flows of the hedged items are typically converted to benchmark variablerate cash flows by entering into receivefixed payvariable interest rate swaps by designating an interest rate swap contract as a hedging instrument and electing to apply asc 815 fair value hedge accounting the carrying value of the debt is adjusted to reflect the impact of changes in the benchmark interest rate with such changes in value recorded in other revenue  the related interest rate swap is recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair value also reflected in other revenue  these amounts are expected to and generally do offset any net amount representing hedge ineffectiveness is automatically reflected in current earnings these fair value hedge relationships use either regression or dollaroffset ratio analysis to assess whether the hedging relationships are highly effective at inception and on an ongoing basis 

citigroup also hedges its exposure to changes in the fair value of fixedrate assets due to changes in benchmark interest rates including availableforsale debt securities and loans the hedging instruments are typically receivevariable payfixed interest rate swaps these fair value hedging relationships use either regression or dollaroffset ratio analysis to assess whether the hedging relationships are highly effective at inception and on an ongoing basis 

 

hedging of foreign exchange risk 

citigroup hedges the change in fair value attributable to foreign exchange rate movements in availableforsale securities that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity holding the securities which may be within or outside the us the hedging instrument is generally a forward foreign exchange contract in this hedge the portion of the change in the fair value of the hedged availableforsale security attributable to foreign exchange risk ie spot rates is reported in earnings and not aoci—which offsets the change in the fair value of the forward contract that is also reflected in earnings citigroup considers the premium associated with forward contracts ie the differential between spot and contractual forward rates as the cost of hedging this amount is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and reflected directly in earnings over the life of the hedge the dollaroffset method is used to assess hedge effectiveness since that assessment is based on changes in fair value attributable to changes in spot rates on both the availableforsale securities and the forward contracts for the portion of the relationship hedged the amount of hedge ineffectiveness is not significant 

hedging of commodity price risk 

citigroup hedges the change in fair value attributable to spot price movements in physical commodities inventory the hedging instrument is a futures contract to sell the underlying commodity in this hedge the change in the value of the hedged inventory is reflected in earnings which offsets the change in the fair value of the futures contract that is also reflected in earnings although the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument recorded in earnings includes changes in forward rates citigroup excludes the differential between the spot and the contractual forward rates under the futures contract from the assessment of hedge effectiveness since the assessment is based on changes in fair value attributable to change in spot prices on both the physical commodity and the futures contract the amount of hedge ineffectiveness is not significant 

the following table summarizes the gains losses on the company’s fair value hedges 





cash flow hedges 

hedging of benchmark interest rate risk 

citigroup hedges the variability of forecasted cash flows associated with floatingrate assetsliabilities and other forecasted transactions variable cash flows from those liabilities are synthetically converted to fixedrate cash flows by entering into receivevariable payfixed interest rate swaps and receivevariable payfixed forwardstarting interest rate swaps variable cash flows associated with certain assets are synthetically converted to fixedrate cash flows by entering into receivefixed payvariable interest rate swaps these cash flow hedging relationships use either regression analysis or dollaroffset ratio analysis to assess whether the hedging relationships are highly effective at inception and on an ongoing basis when the variable interest rates associated with hedged items do not qualify as benchmark interest rates citigroup designates the risk being hedged as the risk of overall variability in the hedged cash flows because efforts are made to match the terms of the derivatives to those of the hedged forecasted cash flows as closely as possible the amount of hedge ineffectiveness is not significant 

for cash flow hedges in which derivatives hedge the variability of forecasted cash flows related to recognized assets liabilities or forecasted transactions the accounting treatment depends on the effectiveness of the hedge to the extent these derivatives are effective in offsetting the variability of the forecasted hedged cash flows the effective portion of the changes in the derivatives’ fair values will not 

 

be included in current earnings but will be reported in   aoci these changes in fair value will be included in the earnings of future periods when the hedged cash flows impact earnings to the extent these derivatives are not fully effective changes in their fair values are immediately included in other revenue  citigroup’s cash flow hedges primarily include hedges of floatingrate assets or liabilities which may include loans and securities purchased under agreements to resell as well as forecasted transactions 

hedging of foreign exchange risk 

citigroup locks in the functional currency equivalent cash flows of longterm debt and shortterm borrowings that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the issuing entity depending on risk management objectives these types of hedges are designated either as cash flow hedges of foreign exchange risk only or cash flow hedges of both foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk and the hedging instruments are foreign exchange crosscurrency swaps and forward contracts these cash flow hedge relationships use dollaroffset ratio analysis to determine whether the hedging relationships are highly effective at inception and on an ongoing basis 

the amount of hedge ineffectiveness on the cash flow hedges recognized in earnings for the years ended   december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  is not significant the pretax change in aoci from cash flow hedges is presented below 



 for cash flow hedges the changes in the fair value of the hedging derivative remain in aoci on the consolidated balance sheet and will be included in the earnings of future periods to offset the variability of the hedged cash flows when such cash flows affect earnings the net gain associated with cash flow hedges expected to be reclassified from aoci within 12 months of december 31 2016  is approximately  01 billion  the maximum length of time over which forecasted cash flows are hedged is 10 years  

the aftertax impact of cash flow hedges on aoci is shown in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements 

net investment hedges 

consistent with asc 83020 foreign currency matters—foreign currency transactions  asc 815 allows the hedging of the foreign currency risk of a net investment in a foreign operation citigroup uses foreign currency forwards crosscurrency swaps options and foreigncurrencydenominated debt instruments to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with citigroup’s equity investments in several nonusdollarfunctionalcurrency foreign subsidiaries citigroup records the change in the carrying amount of these investments in the foreign currency translation adjustment  account within aoci simultaneously the effective portion of the hedge of this exposure is also recorded in the foreign currency translation adjustment  account and any ineffective portion is immediately recorded in earnings 

for derivatives designated as net investment hedges citigroup follows the forwardrate method outlined in asc 8153535 according to that method all changes in fair value including changes related to the forwardrate component of the foreign currency forward contracts and the time value of foreign currency options are recorded in the foreign currency translation adjustment  account within aoci 

for foreigncurrencydenominated debt instruments that are designated as hedges of net investments the translation gain or loss that is recorded in the foreign currency translation adjustment  account is based on the spot exchange rate between the functional currency of the respective subsidiary and the us dollar which is the functional currency of citigroup to the extent the notional amount of the hedging instrument exactly matches the hedged net investment and the underlying exchange rate of the derivative hedging instrument relates to the exchange rate between the functional currency of the net investment and citigroup’s functional currency or in the case of a nonderivative debt instrument such instrument is denominated in the functional currency of the net investment no  ineffectiveness is recorded in earnings 

the pretax gain loss recorded in the foreign currency translation adjustment  account within aoci related to the effective portion of the net investment hedges is  220 million   2475 million  and  2890 million  for the years ended   december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively 

economic hedges 

citigroup often uses economic hedges when hedge accounting would be too complex or operationally burdensome enduser derivatives that are economic hedges are carried at fair value with changes in value included in either principal transactions  or other revenue  

for assetliability management hedging fixedrate longterm debt is recorded at amortized cost under gaap 

for other hedges that either do not meet the asc 815 hedging criteria or for which management decides not to apply asc 815 hedge accounting the derivative is recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with the associated changes in fair value recorded in earnings while the debt continues to be carried at amortized cost therefore current earnings are affected by the interest rate shifts and other factors that cause a change in the swap’s value but for which no offsetting change in value is recorded on the debt 

 

citigroup may alternatively elect to account for the debt at fair value under the fair value option once the irrevocable election is made upon issuance of the debt the full change in fair value of the debt is reported in earnings the changes in fair value of the related interest rate swap are also reflected in earnings which provides a natural offset to the debt’s fair value change to the extent the two amounts differ because the full change in the fair value of the debt includes risks not offset by the interest rate swap the difference is automatically captured in current earnings 

additional economic hedges include hedges of the credit risk component of commercial loans and loan commitments citigroup periodically evaluates its hedging strategies in other areas and may designate either an accounting hedge or an economic hedge after considering the relative costs and benefits economic hedges are also employed when the hedged item itself is marked to market through current earnings such as hedges of commitments to originate one to fourfamily mortgage loans to be held for sale and msrs 

credit derivatives 

citi is a market maker and trades a range of credit derivatives through these contracts citi either purchases or writes protection on either a single name or a portfolio of reference credits citi also uses credit derivatives to help mitigate credit risk in its corporate and consumer loan portfolios and other cash positions and to facilitate client transactions 

citi monitors its counterparty credit risk in credit derivative contracts as of december 31 2016  and december 31 2015  approximately 97  and 98  respectively of the gross receivables are from counterparties with which citi maintains collateral agreements a majority of citi’s top 15  counterparties by receivable balance owed to citi are banks financial institutions or other dealers contracts with these counterparties do not include ratingsbased termination events however counterparty ratings downgrades may have an incremental effect by lowering the threshold at which citi may 

call for additional collateral 

the range of credit derivatives entered into includes credit default swaps total return swaps credit options and creditlinked notes 

a credit default swap is a contract in which for a fee a protection seller agrees to reimburse a protection buyer for any losses that occur due to a predefined credit event on a reference entity these credit events are defined by the terms of the derivative contract and the reference credit and are generally limited to the market standard of failure to pay on indebtedness and bankruptcy of the reference credit and in a more limited range of transactions debt restructuring credit derivative transactions that reference emerging market entities also typically include additional credit events to cover the acceleration of indebtedness and the risk of repudiation or a payment moratorium in certain transactions protection may be provided on a portfolio of reference entities or assetbacked securities if there is no credit event as defined by the specific derivative contract then the protection seller makes no payments to the protection buyer and receives only the contractually specified fee however if a credit event occurs 

as defined in the specific derivative contract sold the protection seller will be required to make a payment to the protection buyer under certain contracts the seller of protection may not be required to make a payment until a specified amount of losses has occurred with respect to the portfolio andor may only be required to pay for losses up to a specified amount 

a total return swap typically transfers the total economic performance of a reference asset which includes all associated cash flows as well as capital appreciation or depreciation the protection buyer receives a floating rate of interest and any depreciation on the reference asset from the protection seller and in return the protection seller receives the cash flows associated with the reference asset plus any appreciation thus according to the total return swap agreement the protection seller will be obligated to make a payment any time the floating interest rate payment plus any depreciation of the reference asset exceeds the cash flows associated with the underlying asset a total return swap may terminate upon a default of the reference asset or a credit event with respect to the reference entity subject to the provisions of the related total return swap agreement between the protection seller and the protection buyer 

a credit option is a credit derivative that allows investors to trade or hedge changes in the credit quality of a reference entity for example in a credit spread option the option writer assumes the obligation to purchase or sell credit protection on the reference entity at a specified “strike” spread level the option purchaser buys the right to sell credit default protection on the reference entity to or purchase it from the option writer at the strike spread level the payments on credit spread options depend either on a particular credit spread or the price of the underlying creditsensitive asset or other reference entity the options usually terminate if a credit event occurs with respect to the underlying reference entity 

a creditlinked note is a form of credit derivative structured as a debt security with an embedded credit default swap the purchaser of the note effectively provides credit protection to the issuer by agreeing to receive a return that could be negatively affected by credit events on the underlying reference credit if the reference entity defaults the note may be cash settled or physically settled by delivery of a debt security of the reference entity thus the maximum amount of the note purchaser’s exposure is the amount paid for the creditlinked note 

the following tables summarize the key characteristics of citi’s credit derivatives portfolio by counterparty and derivative form 



 



 

fair values included in the above tables are prior to application of any netting agreements and cash collateral for notional amounts citi generally has a mismatch between the total notional amounts of protection purchased and sold and it may hold the reference assets directly rather than entering into offsetting credit derivative contracts as and when desired the open risk exposures from credit derivative contracts are largely matched after certain cash positions in reference assets are considered and after notional amounts are adjusted either to a durationbased equivalent basis or to reflect the level of subordination in tranched structures the ratings of the credit derivatives portfolio presented in the tables and used to evaluate paymentperformance risk are based on the assigned internal or external ratings of the reference asset or entity where external ratings are used investmentgrade ratings are considered to be ‘baabbb’ and above while anything below is considered noninvestment grade citi’s internal ratings are in line with the related external rating system 

citigroup evaluates the paymentperformance risk of the credit derivatives for which it stands as a protection seller based on the credit rating assigned to the underlying reference credit credit derivatives written on an underlying noninvestment grade reference credit represent greater payment risk to the company the noninvestment grade category in the table above also includes credit derivatives where the underlying reference entity has been downgraded subsequent to the inception of the derivative 

the maximum potential amount of future payments under credit derivative contracts presented in the table above is based on the notional value of the derivatives the company believes that the notional amount for credit protection sold is not representative of the actual loss exposure based on historical experience this amount has not been reduced by the value of the reference assets and the related cash flows in accordance with most credit derivative contracts should a credit event occur the company usually is liable for the difference between the protection sold and the value of the reference assets furthermore the notional amount for credit protection sold has not been reduced for any cash collateral paid to a given counterparty as such payments would be calculated after netting all derivative exposures including any credit derivatives with that counterparty in accordance with a related master netting agreement due to such netting processes determining the amount of collateral that corresponds to credit derivative exposures alone is not possible the company actively monitors open creditrisk exposures and manages this exposure by using a variety of strategies including purchased credit derivatives cash collateral or direct holdings of the referenced assets this risk mitigation activity is not captured in the table above 

 

creditriskrelated contingent features in derivatives 

certain derivative instruments contain provisions that require the company to either post additional collateral or immediately settle any outstanding liability balances upon the occurrence of a specified event related to the credit risk of the company these events which are defined by the existing derivative contracts are primarily downgrades in the credit ratings of the company and its affiliates the fair value excluding cva of all derivative instruments with creditriskrelated contingent features that were in a net liability position at both december 31 2016  and december 31 2015  was  26 billion  and  22 billion  respectively the company posted  26 billion  and  19 billion  as collateral for this exposure in the normal course of business as of december 31 2016  and december 31 2015  respectively 

a downgrade could trigger additional collateral or cash settlement requirements for the company and certain affiliates in the event that citigroup and citibank were downgraded a single notch by all three  major rating agencies as of december 31 2016  the company could be required to post an additional  15 billion  as either collateral or settlement of the derivative transactions additionally the company could be required to segregate with thirdparty custodians collateral previously received from existing derivative counterparties in the amount of  01 billion  upon the single notch downgrade resulting in aggregate cash obligations and collateral requirements of approximately  16 billion  

derivatives accompanied by financial asset transfers 

the company executes total return swaps which provide it with synthetic exposure to substantially all of the economic return of the securities or other financial assets referenced in the contract in certain cases the derivative transaction is accompanied by the company’s transfer of the referenced financial asset to the derivative counterparty most typically in response to the derivative counterparty’s desire to hedge in whole or in part its synthetic exposure under the derivative contract by holding the referenced asset in funded form in certain jurisdictions these transactions qualify as sales resulting in derecognition of the securities transferred see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the related sale conditions for transfers of financial assets for a significant portion of the transactions the company has also executed another total return swap where the company passes on substantially all of the economic return of the referenced securities to a different third party seeking the exposure in those cases the company is not exposed on a net basis to changes in the economic return of the referenced securities 

these transactions generally involve the transfer of the company’s liquid government bonds convertible bonds or publicly traded corporate equity securities from the trading portfolio and are executed with thirdparty financial institutions the accompanying derivatives are typically total 

return swaps the derivatives are cash settled and subject to ongoing margin requirements 

when the conditions for sale accounting are met the company reports the transfer of the referenced financial asset as a sale and separately reports the accompanying derivative transaction these transactions generally do not result in a gain or loss on the sale of the security because the transferred security was held at fair value in the company’s trading portfolio for transfers of financial assets accounted for by the company as a sale where the company has retained substantially all of the economic exposure to the transferred asset through a total return swap executed in contemplation of the initial sale with the same counterparty and still outstanding as of december 31 2016  and december 31 2015 both the asset carrying amounts derecognized and gross cash proceeds received as of the date of derecognition were 10 billion  at december 31 2016  the fair value of these previously derecognized assets was 10 billion  and the fair value of the total return swaps was 32 million  recorded as gross derivative assets and 23 million  recorded as gross derivative liabilities at december 31 2015 the fair value of these previously derecognized assets was 1 billion  and the fair value of the total return swaps was 7 million  recorded as gross derivative assets and 35 million  recorded as gross derivative liabilities the balances for the total return swaps are on a gross basis before the application of counterparty and cash collateral netting and are included primarily as equity derivatives in the tabular disclosures in this note 

23 concentrations of credit risk 

concentrations of credit risk exist when changes in economic industry or geographic factors similarly affect groups of counterparties whose aggregate credit exposure is material in relation to citigroup’s total credit exposure although citigroup’s portfolio of financial instruments is broadly diversified along industry product and geographic lines material transactions are completed with other financial institutions particularly in the securities trading derivatives and foreign exchange businesses 

in connection with the company’s efforts to maintain a diversified portfolio the company limits its exposure to any one geographic region country or individual creditor and monitors this exposure on a continuous basis at december 31 2016  citigroup’s most significant concentration of credit risk was with the us government and its agencies the company’s exposure which primarily results from trading assets and investments issued by the us government and its agencies amounted to 2285 billion  and 2230 billion  at december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively the german and japan governments and their agencies which are rated investment grade by both moody’s and sp were the next largest exposures the company’s exposure to germany amounted to 276 billion  and 177 billion  at december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively and was composed of investment securities loans and trading assets the company’s exposure to japan amounted to 273 billion  and 188 billion  at december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively and was composed of investment securities loans and trading assets 

the company’s exposure to states and municipalities amounted to 307 billion  and 293 billion  at december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively and was composed of trading assets investment securities derivatives and lending activities 

24 fair value measurement 

asc 82010 fair value measurement  defines fair value establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value and requires disclosures about fair value measurements fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date among other things the standard requires the company to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value 

under asc 82010 the probability of default of a counterparty is factored into the valuation of derivative and other positions as well as the impact of citigroup’s own credit risk on derivatives and other liabilities measured at fair value 

fair value hierarchy 

asc 82010 specifies a hierarchy of inputs based on whether the inputs are observable or unobservable observable inputs are developed using market data and reflect market participant assumptions while unobservable inputs reflect the company’s market assumptions these two types of inputs have created the following fair value hierarchy 

 

as required under the fair value hierarchy the company considers relevant and observable market inputs in its valuations where possible the frequency of transactions the size of the bidask spread and the amount of adjustment necessary when comparing similar transactions are all factors in determining the liquidity of markets and the relevance of observed prices in those markets 

the company’s policy with respect to transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy is to recognize transfers into and out of each level as of the end of the reporting period 

determination of fair value 

for assets and liabilities carried at fair value the company measures fair value using the procedures set out below irrespective of whether the assets and liabilities are measured at fair value as a result of an election or whether they are required to be measured at fair value 

when available the company uses quoted market prices to determine fair value and classifies such items as level 1 in some cases where a market price is available the 

 

company will make use of acceptable practical expedients such as matrix pricing to calculate fair value in which case the items are classified as level 2 

the company may also apply a pricebased methodology which utilizes where available quoted prices or other market information obtained from recent trading activity in positions with the same or similar characteristics to the position being valued the market activity and the amount of the bidask spread are among the factors considered in determining the liquidity of markets and the observability of prices from those markets if relevant and observable prices are available those valuations may be classified as level 2 when less liquidity exists for a security or loan a quoted price is stale a significant adjustment to the price of a similar security is necessary to reflect differences in the terms of the actual security or loan being valued or prices from independent sources are insufficient to corroborate the valuation the “price” inputs are considered unobservable and the fair value measurements are classified as level 3 

if quoted market prices are not available fair value is based upon internally developed valuation techniques that use where possible current marketbased parameters such as interest rates currency rates and option volatilities items valued using such internally generated valuation techniques are classified according to the lowest level input or value driver that is significant to the valuation thus an item may be classified as level 3 even though there may be some significant inputs that are readily observable 

fair value estimates from internal valuation techniques are verified where possible to prices obtained from independent vendors or brokers vendors’ and brokers’ valuations may be based on a variety of inputs ranging from observed prices to proprietary valuation models 

the following section describes the valuation methodologies used by the company to measure various financial instruments at fair value including an indication of the level in the fair value hierarchy in which each instrument is generally classified where appropriate the description includes details of the valuation models the key inputs to those models and any significant assumptions 

market valuation adjustments 

generally the unit of account for a financial instrument is the individual financial instrument the company applies market valuation adjustments that are consistent with the unit of account which does not include adjustment due to the size of the company’s position except as follows asc 82010 permits an exception through an accounting policy election to measure the fair value of a portfolio of financial assets and financial liabilities on the basis of the net open risk position when certain criteria are met citi has elected to measure certain portfolios of financial instruments such as derivatives that meet those criteria on the basis of the net open risk position the company applies market valuation adjustments including adjustments to account for the size of the net open risk position consistent with market participant assumptions and in accordance with the unit of account 

liquidity adjustments are applied to items in level 2 or level 3 of the fairvalue hierarchy in an effort to ensure that the fair value reflects the price at which the net open risk position could be liquidated the liquidity adjustment is based on the bidoffer spread for an instrument when citi has elected to measure certain portfolios of financial investments such as derivatives on the basis of the net open risk position the liquidity adjustment may be adjusted to take into account the size of the position 

credit valuation adjustments cva and funding valuation adjustments fva are applied to overthecounter otc derivative instruments in which the base valuation generally discounts expected cash flows using the relevant base interest rate curve for the currency of the derivative eg libor for uncollateralized usdollar derivatives as not all counterparties have the same credit risk as that implied by the relevant base curve a cva is necessary to incorporate the market view of both counterparty credit risk and citi’s own credit risk in the valuation fva reflects a market funding risk premium inherent in the uncollateralized portion of derivative portfolios and in collateralized derivatives where the terms of the agreement do not permit the reuse of the collateral received 

citi’s cva and fva methodology consists of two steps 

 the cva and fva are designed to incorporate a market view of the credit and funding risk respectively inherent in 

 

the derivative portfolio however most unsecured derivative instruments are negotiated bilateral contracts and are not commonly transferred to third parties derivative instruments are normally settled contractually or if terminated early are terminated at a value negotiated bilaterally between the counterparties thus the cva and fva may not be realized upon a settlement or termination in the normal course of business in addition all or a portion of these adjustments may be reversed or otherwise adjusted in future periods in the event of changes in the credit or funding risk associated with the derivative instruments 

the table below summarizes the cva and fva applied to the fair value of derivative instruments at december 31 2016 and 2015 



 

the table below summarizes pretax gains losses related to changes in cva on derivative instruments net of hedges fva on derivatives and debt valuation adjustments dva on citi’s own fair value option fvo liabilities for the years indicated 



 

valuation process for fair value measurements 

price verification procedures and related internal control procedures are governed by the citigroup pricing and price verification policy and standards  which is jointly owned by finance and risk management 

for fair value measurements of substantially all assets and liabilities held by the company individual business units are responsible for valuing the trading account assets and liabilities and product control within finance performs independent price verification procedures to evaluate those fair value measurements product control is independent of the individual business units and reports to the global head of product control it has authority over the valuation of financial assets and liabilities fair value measurements of assets and liabilities are determined using various techniques including but not limited to discounted cash flows and internal models such as option and correlation models 

based on the observability of inputs used product control classifies the inventory as level 1 level 2 or level 3 of the fair value hierarchy when a position involves one or more significant inputs that are not directly observable price verification procedures are performed that may include reviewing relevant historical data analyzing profit and loss valuing each component of a structured trade individually and benchmarking among others 

reports of inventory that is classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are distributed to senior management in finance risk and the business this inventory is also discussed in risk committees and in monthly meetings with senior trading management as deemed necessary reports may go to the audit committee of the board of directors or to the full board of directors whenever an adjustment is needed to bring the price of an asset or liability to its exit price product control reports it to management along with other price verification results 

in addition the pricing models used in measuring fair value are governed by an independent control framework although the models are developed and tested by the individual business units they are independently validated by the model validation group within risk management and reviewed by finance with respect to their impact on the price verification procedures the purpose of this independent control framework is to assess model risk arising from models’ theoretical soundness calibration techniques where needed and the appropriateness of the model for a specific product in a defined market to ensure their continued applicability models are independently reviewed annually in addition risk management approves and maintains a list of products permitted to be valued under each approved model for a given business 

 

securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under agreements to repurchase 

no quoted prices exist for these instruments so fair value is determined using a discounted cashflow technique cash flows are estimated based on the terms of the contract taking into account any embedded derivative or other features these cash flows are discounted using interest rates appropriate to the maturity of the instrument as well as the nature of the underlying collateral generally when such instruments are recorded at fair value they are classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as the inputs used in the valuation are readily observable however certain longdated positions are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy 

trading account assets and liabilities—trading securities and trading loans 

when available the company uses quoted market prices in active markets to determine the fair value of trading securities such items are classified as level 1 of the fair value hierarchy examples include government securities and exchangetraded equity securities 

for bonds and secondary market loans traded over the counter the company generally determines fair value utilizing valuation techniques including discounted cash flows pricebased and internal models such as blackscholes and monte carlo simulation fair value estimates from these internal valuation techniques are verified where possible to prices obtained from independent sources including thirdparty vendors vendors compile prices from various sources and may apply matrix pricing for similar bonds or loans where no price is observable a pricebased methodology utilizes where available quoted prices or other market information obtained from recent trading activity of assets with similar characteristics to the bond or loan being valued the yields used in discounted cash flow models are derived from the same price information trading securities and loans priced using such methods are generally classified as level 2 however when less liquidity exists for a security or loan a quoted price is stale a significant adjustment to the price of a similar security or loan is necessary to reflect differences in the terms of the actual security or loan being valued or prices from independent sources are insufficient to corroborate valuation a loan or security is generally classified as level 3 the price input used in a pricebased methodology may be zero for a security such as a subprime cdo that is not receiving any principal or interest and is currently written down to zero 

when the company’s principal market for a portfolio of loans is the securitization market the company uses the securitization price to determine the fair value of the portfolio the securitization price is determined from the assumed proceeds of a hypothetical securitization in the current market adjusted for transformation costs ie direct costs other than transaction costs and securitization uncertainties such as market conditions and liquidity as a result of the severe reduction in the level of activity in certain securitization markets since the second half of 2007 observable securitization prices for certain directly 

comparable portfolios of loans have not been readily available therefore such portfolios of loans are generally classified as level 3 of the fair value hierarchy however for other loan securitization markets such as commercial real estate loans price verification of the hypothetical securitizations has been possible since these markets have remained active accordingly this loan portfolio is classified as level 2 of the fair value hierarchy 

for most of the lending and structured direct subprime exposures fair value is determined utilizing observable transactions where available other market data for similar assets in markets that are not active and other internal valuation techniques the valuation of certain assetbacked security abs cdo positions utilizes prices based on the underlying assets of the abs cdo 

trading account assets and liabilities—derivatives 

exchangetraded derivatives measured at fair value using quoted ie exchange prices in active markets where available are classified as level 1 of the fair value hierarchy 

derivatives without a quoted price in an active market and derivatives executed over the counter are valued using internal valuation techniques these derivative instruments are classified as either level 2 or level 3 depending upon the observability of the significant inputs to the model 

the valuation techniques and inputs depend on the type of derivative and the nature of the underlying instrument the principal techniques used to value these instruments are discounted cash flows and internal models including blackscholes and monte carlo simulation 

the key inputs depend upon the type of derivative and the nature of the underlying instrument and include interest rate yield curves foreign exchange rates volatilities and correlation the company uses overnight indexed swap ois curves as fair value measurement inputs for the valuation of certain collateralized derivatives citi uses the relevant benchmark curve for the currency of the derivative eg the london interbank offered rate for us dollar derivatives as the discount rate for uncollateralized derivatives 

as referenced above during the third  quarter of 2015  citi incorporated fva into the fair value measurements due to what it believes to be an industry migration toward incorporating the market’s view of funding risk premium in otc derivatives the charge incurred in connection with the implementation of fva was reflected in principal transactions  as a change in accounting estimate citi’s fva methodology leverages the existing cva methodology to estimate a funding exposure profile the calculation of this exposure profile considers collateral agreements where the terms do not permit the company to reuse the collateral received including where counterparties post collateral to thirdparty custodians 

 

investments 

the investments category includes availableforsale debt and marketable equity securities whose fair values are generally determined by utilizing similar procedures described for trading securities above or in some cases using vendor pricing as the primary source 

also included in investments are nonpublic investments in private equity and real estate entities determining the fair value of nonpublic securities involves a significant degree of management judgment as no quoted prices exist and such securities are generally thinly traded in addition there may be transfer restrictions on private equity securities the company’s process for determining the fair value of such securities utilizes commonly accepted valuation techniques including comparables analysis in determining the fair value of nonpublic securities the company also considers events such as a proposed sale of the investee company initial public offerings equity issuances or other observable transactions 

private equity securities are generally classified as level 3 of the fair value hierarchy 

in addition the company holds investments in certain alternative investment funds that calculate nav per share including hedge funds private equity funds and real estate funds investments in funds are generally classified as nonmarketable equity securities carried at fair value the fair values of these investments are estimated using the nav per share of the company’s ownership interest in the funds where it is not probable that the investment will be realized at a price other than the nav consistent with the provisions of asu no 201507 these investments have not been categorized within the fair value hierarchy and are not included in the tables below see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

shortterm borrowings and longterm debt 

where fair value accounting has been elected the fair value of nonstructured liabilities is determined by utilizing internal models using the appropriate discount rate for the applicable maturity such instruments are generally classified as level 2 of the fair value hierarchy when all significant inputs are readily observable 

the company determines the fair value of hybrid financial instruments including structured liabilities using the appropriate derivative valuation methodology described above in “trading account assets and liabilities—derivatives” given the nature of the embedded risk profile such instruments are classified as level 2 or level 3 depending on the observability of significant inputs to the model 

items measured at fair value on a recurring basis 

the following tables present for each of the fair value hierarchy levels the company’s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis at december 31 2016  and december 31 2015  the company may hedge positions that have been classified in the level 3 category with other financial instruments hedging instruments that may be 

 

classified as level 3 but also with financial instruments classified as level 1 or level 2 of the fair value hierarchy the effects of these hedges are presented gross in the following tables

the following tables present the changes in the level 3 fair value category for the years ended   december 31 2016  and 2015  the gains and losses presented below include changes in the fair value related to both observable and unobservable inputs 

the company often hedges positions with offsetting positions that are classified in a different level for example the gains and losses for assets and liabilities in the level 3 

 

category presented in the tables below do not reflect the effect of offsetting losses and gains on hedging instruments that may be classified in the level 1 and level 2 categories in addition the company hedges items classified in the level 3 category with instruments also classified in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy the hedged items and related hedges are presented gross in the following tables

valuation techniques and inputs for level 3 fair value measurements 

the company’s level 3 inventory consists of both cash 

instruments and derivatives of varying complexity the 

valuation methodologies used to measure the fair value of 

these positions include discounted cash flow analysis internal 

models and comparative analysis a position is classified 

within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy when at least one 

input is unobservable and is considered significant to its 

valuation the specific reason an input is deemed 

unobservable varies for example at least one significant 

input to the pricing model is not observable in the market at 

 

least one significant input has been adjusted to make it more 

representative of the position being valued or the price quote 

available does not reflect sufficient trading activities 

the following tables present the valuation techniques covering the majority of level 3 inventory and the most significant unobservable inputs used in level 3 fair value measurements differences between this table and amounts presented in the level 3 fair value rollforward table represent individually immaterial items that have been measured using a variety of valuation techniques other than those listed

the impact of key unobservable inputs on the level 3 fair value measurements may not be independent of one another in addition the amount and direction of the impact on a fair value measurement for a given change in an unobservable input depends on the nature of the instrument as well as whether the company holds the instrument as an asset or a liability for certain instruments the pricing hedging and risk management are sensitive to the correlation between various inputs rather than on the analysis and aggregation of the individual inputs 

the following section describes the sensitivities and interrelationships of the most significant unobservable inputs used by the company in level 3 fair value measurements 

correlation 

correlation is a measure of the extent to which two or more variables change in relation to each other a variety of correlationrelated assumptions are required for a wide range of instruments including equity and credit baskets foreignexchange options cdos backed by loans or bonds mortgages subprime mortgages and many other instruments for almost all of these instruments correlations are not observable in the market and must be calculated using historical information estimating correlation can be especially difficult where it may vary over time calculating correlation information from market data requires significant assumptions regarding the informational efficiency of the market for example swaption markets changes in correlation levels can have a major impact favorable or unfavorable on the value of an instrument depending on its nature a change in the default correlation of the fair value of the underlying bonds comprising a cdo structure would affect the fair value of the senior tranche for example an increase in the default correlation of the underlying bonds would reduce the fair value of the senior tranche because highly correlated instruments produce larger losses in the event of default and a part of these losses would become attributable to the senior tranche that same change in default correlation would have a different impact on junior tranches of the same structure 

volatility 

volatility represents the speed and severity of market price changes and is a key factor in pricing options typically instruments can become more expensive if volatility increases for example as an index becomes more volatile the cost to citi of maintaining a given level of exposure increases because more frequent rebalancing of the portfolio is required volatility generally depends on the tenor of the underlying instrument and the strike price or level defined in the contract volatilities for certain combinations of tenor and strike are not observable the general relationship between changes in the value of a portfolio to changes in volatility also depends on changes in interest rates and the level of the underlying index generally long option positions assets benefit from increases in volatility whereas short option positions liabilities will suffer losses some instruments are more sensitive to changes in volatility than others for example an 

 

atthemoney option would experience a larger percentage change in its fair value than a deepinthemoney option in addition the fair value of an option with more than one underlying security for example an option on a basket of bonds depends on the volatility of the individual underlying securities as well as their correlations 

yield 

in some circumstances the yield of an instrument is not observable in the market and must be estimated from historical data or from yields of similar securities this estimated yield may need to be adjusted to capture the characteristics of the security being valued in other situations the estimated yield may not represent sufficient market liquidity and must be adjusted as well whenever the amount of the adjustment is significant to the value of the security the fair value measurement is classified as level 3 

adjusted yield is generally used to discount the projected future principal and interest cash flows on instruments such as assetbacked securities adjusted yield is impacted by changes in the interest rate environment and relevant credit spreads 

prepayment 

voluntary unscheduled payments prepayments change the future cash flows for the investor and thereby change the fair value of the security the effect of prepayments is more pronounced for residential mortgagebacked securities an increase in prepayments—in speed or magnitude—generally creates losses for the holder of these securities prepayment is generally negatively correlated with delinquency and interest rate a combination of low prepayment and high delinquencies amplify each input’s negative impact on mortgage securities’ valuation as prepayment speeds change the weighted average life of the security changes which impacts the valuation either positively or negatively depending upon the nature of the security and the direction of the change in the weighted average life 

recovery 

recovery is the proportion of the total outstanding balance of a bond or loan that is expected to be collected in a liquidation scenario for many credit securities such as assetbacked securities there is no directly observable market input for recovery but indications of recovery levels are available from pricing services the assumed recovery of a security may differ from its actual recovery that will be observable in the future the recovery rate impacts the valuation of credit securities generally an increase in the recovery rate assumption increases the fair value of the security an increase in loss severity the inverse of the recovery rate reduces the amount of principal available for distribution and as a result decreases the fair value of the security 

credit spread 

credit spread is a component of the security representing its credit quality credit spread reflects the market perception of changes in prepayment delinquency and recovery rates therefore capturing the impact of other variables on the fair value changes in credit spread affect the fair value of 

securities differently depending on the characteristics and maturity profile of the security for example credit spread is a more significant driver of the fair value measurement of a high yield bond as compared to an investment grade bond generally the credit spread for an investment grade bond is also more observable and less volatile than its high yield counterpart 

qualitative discussion of the ranges of significant unobservable inputs 

the following section describes the ranges of the most significant unobservable inputs used by the company in level 3 fair value measurements the level of aggregation and the diversity of instruments held by the company lead to a wide range of unobservable inputs that may not be evenly distributed across the level 3 inventory 

correlation 

there are many different types of correlation inputs including credit correlation crossasset correlation such as equityinterest rate correlation and sameasset correlation such as interest rateinterest rate correlation correlation inputs are generally used to value hybrid and exotic instruments generally sameasset correlation inputs have a narrower range than crossasset correlation inputs however due to the complex and unique nature of these instruments the ranges for correlation inputs can vary widely across portfolios 

volatility 

similar to correlation assetspecific volatility inputs vary widely by asset type for example ranges for foreign exchange volatility are generally lower and narrower than equity volatility equity volatilities are wider due to the nature of the equities market and the terms of certain exotic instruments for most instruments the interest rate volatility input is on the lower end of the range however for certain structured or exotic instruments such as marketlinked deposits or exotic interest rate derivatives the range is much wider 

yield 

ranges for the yield inputs vary significantly depending upon the type of security for example securities that typically have lower yields such as municipal bonds will fall on the lower end of the range while more illiquid securities or securities with lower credit quality such as certain residual tranche assetbacked securities will have much higher yield inputs 

credit spread 

credit spread is relevant primarily for fixed income and credit instruments however the ranges for the credit spread input can vary across instruments for example certain fixed income instruments such as certificates of deposit typically have lower credit spreads whereas certain derivative instruments with highrisk counterparties are typically subject to higher credit spreads when they are uncollateralized or have a longer tenor other instruments such as credit default swaps also have credit spreads that vary with the attributes of the 

 

underlying obligor stronger companies have tighter credit spreads and weaker companies have wider credit spreads 

price 

the price input is a significant unobservable input for certain fixed income instruments for these instruments the price input is expressed as a percentage of the notional amount with a price of 100 meaning that the instrument is valued at par for most of these instruments the price varies between zero  to 100  or slightly above 100 relatively illiquid assets that have experienced significant losses since issuance such as certain assetbacked securities are at the lower end of the range whereas most investment grade corporate bonds will fall in the middle to the higher end of the range for certain structured debt instruments with embedded derivatives the price input may be above 100  to reflect the embedded features of the instrument for example a stepup coupon or a conversion option 

the price input is also a significant unobservable input for certain equity securities however the range of price inputs varies depending on the nature of the position the number of shares outstanding and other factors 

mean reversion 

a number of financial instruments require an estimate of the rate at which the interest rate reverts to its longterm average changes in this estimate can significantly affect the fair value of these instruments however sometimes there are insufficient external market data to calibrate this parameter especially when pricing more complex instruments the level of mean reversion affects the correlation between short and longterm interest rates the fair values of more complex instruments such as bermudan swaptions options with multiple exercise dates and constant maturity spread options or structured debts with these embedded features are more sensitive to the changes in this correlation as compared to less complex instruments such as caps and floors 

items measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis 

certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and therefore are not included in the tables above these include assets measured at cost that have been written down to fair value during the periods as a result of an impairment in addition these assets include loans heldforsale and other real estate owned that are measured at the lower of cost or market 

the following table presents the carrying amounts of all assets that were still held for which a nonrecurring fair value measurement was recorded 





 

the fair value of loans heldforsale is determined where possible using quoted secondarymarket prices if no such quoted price exists the fair value of a loan is determined using quoted prices for a similar asset or assets adjusted for the specific attributes of that loan fair value for the other real estate owned is based on appraisals for loans whose carrying amount is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral the fair values depend on the type of collateral fair value of the collateral is typically estimated based on quoted market prices if available appraisals or other internal valuation techniques 

where the fair value of the related collateral is based on an unadjusted appraised value the loan is generally classified as level 2 where significant adjustments are made to the appraised value the loan is classified as level 3 additionally for corporate loans appraisals of the collateral are often based on sales of similar assets however because the prices of similar assets require significant adjustments to reflect the unique features of the underlying collateral these fair value measurements are generally classified as level 3 

valuation techniques and inputs for level 3 nonrecurring fair value measurements 

the following tables present the valuation techniques covering the majority of level 3 nonrecurring fair value measurements and the most significant unobservable inputs used in those measurements 





 

nonrecurring fair value changes 

the following table presents total nonrecurring fair value measurements for the period included in earnings attributable to the change in fair value relating to assets that were still held 







estimated fair value of financial instruments not carried at fair value 

the table below presents the carrying value and fair value of citigroup’s financial instruments that are not carried at fair value the table below therefore excludes items measured at fair value on a recurring basis presented in the tables above 

the disclosure also excludes leases affiliate investments pension and benefit obligations certain insurance contracts and taxrelated items also as required the disclosure excludes the effect of taxes any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the entire holdings of a particular instrument excess fair value associated with deposits with no fixed maturity and other expenses that would be incurred in a market transaction in addition the table excludes the values of nonfinancial assets and liabilities as well as a wide range of franchise relationship and intangible values which are integral to a full assessment of citigroup’s financial position and the value of its net assets 

the fair value represents management’s best estimates based on a range of methodologies and assumptions the 

 

carrying value of shortterm financial instruments not accounted for at fair value as well as receivables and payables arising in the ordinary course of business approximates fair value because of the relatively short period of time between their origination and expected realization quoted market prices are used when available for investments and for liabilities such as longterm debt not carried at fair value for loans not accounted for at fair value cash flows are discounted at quoted secondary market rates or estimated market rates if available otherwise sales of comparable loan portfolios or current market origination rates for loans with similar terms and risk characteristics are used expected credit losses are either embedded in the estimated future cash flows or incorporated as an adjustment to the discount rate used the value of collateral is also considered for liabilities such as longterm debt not accounted for at fair value and without quoted market prices market borrowing rates of interest are used to discount contractual cash flows 







 

fair values vary from period to period based on changes in a wide range of factors including interest rates credit quality and market perceptions of value and as existing assets and liabilities run off and new transactions are entered into the estimated fair values of loans reflect changes in credit status since the loans were made changes in interest rates in the case of fixedrate loans and premium values at origination of certain loans 

the estimated fair values of the company’s corporate unfunded lending commitments at december 31 2016  and december 31 2015  were liabilities of 52 billion  and 70 billion  respectively substantially all of which are classified as level 3 the company does not estimate the fair values of consumer unfunded lending commitments which are generally cancelable by providing notice to the borrower 

25 fair value elections 

citi may elect to report most financial instruments and certain other items at fair value on an instrumentbyinstrument basis with changes in fair value reported in earnings other than dva see below the election is made upon the initial recognition of an eligible financial asset financial liability or firm commitment or when certain specified reconsideration events occur the fair value election may not be revoked once an election is made the changes in fair value are recorded in 

 

current earnings other than dva which from january 1 2016 is reported in aoci additional discussion regarding the applicable areas in which fair value elections were made is presented in note 24 to the consolidated financial statements 

the company has elected fair value accounting for its mortgage servicing rights see note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussions regarding the accounting and reporting of msrs 

the following table presents the changes in fair value of those items for which the fair value option has been elected 



own debt valuation adjustments dva 

own debt valuation adjustments are recognized on citi’s liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected using citi’s credit spreads observed in the bond market among other variables the fair value of liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected other than nonrecourse and similar liabilities is impacted by the narrowing or widening of citi’s credit spreads the estimated change in the fair value of these liabilities due to such changes in citi’s own credit spread or instrumentspecific credit risk was a loss of  538 million  and a gain of  367 million  for the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively changes in fair value resulting from changes in instrumentspecific credit risk were estimated by incorporating citi’s current credit spreads observable in the bond market into the relevant valuation technique used to value each liability as described above effective january 1 2016 changes in fair value of fair value option liabilities related to changes in citi’s own credit spreads dva are reflected as a component of aoci previously these amounts were recognized in citi’s  revenues  and net income along with all other changes in fair value see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 

selected portfolios of securities purchased under agreements to resell securities borrowed securities sold under agreements to repurchase securities loaned and certain noncollateralized shortterm borrowings 

citi elected the fair value option for certain portfolios of fixedincome securities purchased under agreements to resell and fixedincome securities sold under agreements to repurchase securities borrowed securities loaned and certain noncollateralized shortterm borrowings held primarily by brokerdealer entities in the united states united kingdom and japan in each case the election was made because the related interestrate risk is managed on a portfolio basis primarily with offsetting derivative instruments that are accounted for at fair value through earnings 

 

changes in fair value for transactions in these portfolios are recorded in principal transactions  the related interest revenue and interest expense are measured based on the contractual rates specified in the transactions and are reported as interest revenue and expense in the consolidated statement of income 

certain loans and other credit products 

citi has also elected the fair value option for certain other originated and purchased loans including certain unfunded loan products such as guarantees and letters of credit executed by citi’s lending and trading businesses none of these credit products are highly leveraged financing commitments significant groups of transactions include loans and unfunded loan products that are expected to be either sold or securitized in the near term or transactions where the economic risks are hedged with derivative instruments such as purchased credit default swaps or total return swaps where citi pays the total return on the underlying loans to a third party citi has elected the fair value option to mitigate accounting mismatches in cases where hedge accounting is complex and to achieve operational simplifications fair value was not elected for most lending transactions across citi 

the following table provides information about certain credit products carried at fair value 



in addition to the amounts reported above  1828 million  and  2113 million  of unfunded commitments related to certain credit products selected for fair value accounting were outstanding as of december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively 

 

changes in the fair value of funded and unfunded credit products are classified in principal transactions  in citi’s consolidated statement of income related interest revenue is measured based on the contractual interest rates and reported as interest revenue  on trading account assets  or loan interest depending on the balance sheet classifications of the credit products the changes in fair value for the years ended 

december 31 2016  and 2015  due to instrumentspecific credit risk totaled to a gain of  76 million  and a loss of  221 million  respectively 

certain investments in unallocated precious metals 

citi invests in unallocated precious metals accounts gold silver platinum and palladium as part of its commodity and foreign currency trading activities or to economically hedge certain exposures from issuing structured liabilities under asc 815 the investment is bifurcated into a debt host contract and a commodity forward derivative instrument citi elects the fair value option for the debt host contract and reports the debt host contract within trading account assets  on citi’s consolidated balance sheet the total carrying amount of debt host contracts across unallocated precious metals accounts was approximately  06 billion  and  06 billion  at december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively the amounts are expected to fluctuate based on trading activity in future periods 

as part of its commodity and foreign currency trading activities citi trades unallocated precious metals investments and executes forward purchase and forward sale derivative contracts with trading counterparties when citi sells an unallocated precious metals investment citi’s receivable from its depository bank is repaid and citi derecognizes its investment in the unallocated precious metal the forward purchase or sale contract with the trading counterparty indexed to unallocated precious metals is accounted for as a derivative at fair value through earnings as of december 31 2016  there were approximately  172 billion  and  124 billion  notional amounts of such forward purchase and forward sale derivative contracts outstanding respectively 

 

certain investments in private equity and real estate ventures and certain equity method and other investments 

citi invests in private equity and real estate ventures for the purpose of earning investment returns and for capital appreciation citi has elected the fair value option for certain of these ventures because such investments are considered similar to many private equity or hedge fund activities in citi’s investment companies which are reported at fair value the fair value option brings consistency in the accounting and evaluation of these investments all investments debt and equity in such private equity and real estate entities are accounted for at fair value these investments are classified as investments  on citi’s consolidated balance sheet 

changes in the fair values of these investments are classified in other revenue  in citi’s consolidated statement of income 

citi also elects the fair value option for certain nonmarketable equity securities whose risk is managed with derivative instruments that are accounted for at fair value through earnings these securities are classified as trading account assets  on citi’s consolidated balance sheet changes in the fair value of these securities and the related derivative instruments are recorded in principal transactions  

certain mortgage loans held for sale hfs 

citi has elected the fair value option for certain purchased and originated prime fixedrate and conforming adjustablerate first mortgage loans hfs these loans are intended for sale or securitization and are hedged with derivative instruments citi has elected the fair value option to mitigate accounting mismatches in cases where hedge accounting is complex and to achieve operational simplifications 

the following table provides information about certain mortgage loans hfs carried at fair value 



the changes in the fair values of these mortgage loans are reported in other revenue  in citi’s consolidated statement of income there was no net change in fair value during the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  due to instrumentspecific credit risk related interest income continues to be measured based on the contractual interest rates and reported as interest revenue  in the consolidated statement of income 

certain structured liabilities 

citi has elected the fair value option for certain structured liabilities whose performance is linked to structured interest rates inflation currency equity referenced credit or commodity risks citi elected the fair value option because these exposures are considered to be tradingrelated positions and therefore are managed on a fair value basis these positions will continue to be classified as debt deposits or derivatives  trading account liabilities  on citi’s consolidated balance sheet according to their legal form 

the following table provides information about the carrying value of structured notes disaggregated by type of embedded derivative instrument 



prior to 2016 the total change in the fair value of these structured liabilities was reported in principal transactions  in citi’s consolidated statement of income beginning in the first quarter of 2016 the portion of the changes in fair value attributable to changes in citi’s own credit spreads dva are reflected as a component of aoci while all other changes in fair value will continue to be reported in principal transactions  changes in the fair value of these structured liabilities include accrued interest which is also included in the change in fair value reported in principal transactions  

certain nonstructured liabilities 

citi has elected the fair value option for certain nonstructured liabilities with fixed and floating interest rates citi has elected the fair value option where the interestrate risk of such liabilities may be economically hedged with derivative contracts or the proceeds are used to purchase financial assets 

 

that will also be accounted for at fair value through earnings the elections have been made to mitigate accounting mismatches and to achieve operational simplifications these positions are reported in shortterm borrowings  and longterm debt  on citi’s consolidated balance sheet prior to 2016 the total change in the fair value of these nonstructured liabilities was reported in principal transactions  in citi’s consolidated statement of income beginning in the first quarter of 2016 the portion of the changes in fair value attributable to changes in citi’s own credit spreads dva are reflected as a component of aoci while all other changes in fair value will continue to be reported in principal transactions  

 interest expense on nonstructured liabilities is measured based on the contractual interest rates and reported as interest expense  in the consolidated statement of income 

the following table provides information about longterm debt carried at fair value 



the following table provides information about shortterm borrowings carried at fair value 



26 pledged assets collateral guarantees and commitments 

pledged assets 

in connection with citi’s financing and trading activities citi has pledged assets to collateralize its obligations under repurchase agreements secured financing agreements secured liabilities of consolidated vies and other borrowings the approximate carrying values of the significant components of pledged assets recognized on citi’s consolidated balance sheet included 



in addition included in cash and due from banks  at december 31 2016  and 2015  were 68 billion  and 50 billion  respectively of cash segregated under federal and other brokerage regulations or deposited with clearing organizations 

collateral 

at december 31 2016  and 2015  the approximate fair value of collateral received by citi that may be resold or repledged excluding the impact of allowable netting was 3781 billion  and 3475 billion  respectively this collateral was received in connection with resale agreements securities borrowings and loans derivative transactions and margined broker loans 

at december 31 2016  and 2015  a substantial portion of the collateral received by citi had been sold or repledged in connection with repurchase agreements securities sold not yet purchased securities borrowings and loans pledges to clearing organizations segregation requirements under securities laws and regulations derivative transactions and bank loans 

in addition at december 31 2016  and 2015  citi had pledged 388 billion  and 396 billion  respectively of 

 

collateral that may not be sold or repledged by the secured parties 

lease commitments 

rental expense principally for offices and computer equipment was 11 billion  13 billion  and 14 billion  for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively 

future minimum annual rentals under noncancelable leases net of sublease income are as follows 



guarantees 

citi provides a variety of guarantees and indemnifications to its customers to enhance their credit standing and enable them to complete a wide variety of business transactions for 

certain contracts meeting the definition of a guarantee the guarantor must recognize at inception a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 

in addition the guarantor must disclose the maximum potential amount of future payments that the guarantor could be required to make under the guarantee if there were a total 

default by the guaranteed parties the determination of the maximum potential future payments is based on the notional amount of the guarantees without consideration of possible recoveries under recourse provisions or from collateral held or pledged as such citi believes such amounts bear no relationship to the anticipated losses if any on these guarantees 

the following tables present information about citi’s guarantees 





 

financial standby letters of credit 

citi issues standby letters of credit which substitute its own credit for that of the borrower if a letter of credit is drawn down the borrower is obligated to repay citi standby letters of credit protect a third party from defaults on contractual obligations financial standby letters of credit include i guarantees of payment of insurance premiums and reinsurance risks that support industrial revenue bond underwriting ii settlement of payment obligations to clearing houses including futures and overthecounter derivatives clearing see further discussion below iii support options and purchases of securities in lieu of escrow deposit accounts and iv letters of credit that backstop loans credit facilities promissory notes and trade acceptances 

performance guarantees 

performance guarantees and letters of credit are issued to guarantee a customer’s tender bid on a construction or systemsinstallation project or to guarantee completion of such projects in accordance with contract terms they are also issued to support a customer’s obligation to supply specified products commodities or maintenance or warranty services to a third party 

derivative instruments considered to be guarantees 

derivatives are financial instruments whose cash flows are based on a notional amount and an underlying instrument reference credit or index where there is little or no initial investment and whose terms require or permit net settlement for a discussion of citi’s derivatives activities see note 22 to the consolidated financial statements 

derivative instruments considered to be guarantees include only those instruments that require citi to make payments to the counterparty based on changes in an underlying instrument that is related to an asset a liability or an equity security held by the guaranteed party more specifically derivative instruments considered to be guarantees include certain overthecounter written put 

 

options where the counterparty is not a bank hedge fund or brokerdealer such counterparties are considered to be dealers in these markets and may therefore not hold the underlying instruments credit derivatives sold by citi are excluded from the tables above as they are disclosed separately in note 22 to the consolidated financial statements in instances where citi’s maximum potential future payment is unlimited the notional amount of the contract is disclosed 

loans sold with recourse 

loans sold with recourse represent citi’s obligations to reimburse the buyers for loan losses under certain circumstances recourse refers to the clause in a sales agreement under which a sellerlender will fully reimburse the buyerinvestor for any losses resulting from the purchased loans this may be accomplished by the seller taking back any loans that become delinquent 

in addition to the amounts shown in the tables above citi has recorded a repurchase reserve for its potential repurchases or makewhole liability regarding residential mortgage representation and warranty claims related to its whole loan sales to the us governmentsponsored enterprises gses and to a lesser extent private investors the repurchase reserve was approximately 107 million  and 152 million  at december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively and these amounts are included in other liabilities  on the consolidated balance sheet 

securities lending indemnifications 

owners of securities frequently lend those securities for a fee to other parties who may sell them short or deliver them to another party to satisfy some other obligation banks may administer such securities lending programs for their clients securities lending indemnifications are issued by the bank to guarantee that a securities lending customer will be made whole in the event that the security borrower does not return 

the security subject to the lending agreement and collateral held is insufficient to cover the market value of the security 

credit card merchant processing 

credit card merchant processing guarantees represent the company’s indirect obligations in connection with i providing transaction processing services to various merchants with respect to its privatelabel cards and ii potential liability for bank card transaction processing services the nature of the liability in either case arises as a result of a billing dispute between a merchant and a cardholder that is ultimately resolved in the cardholder’s favor the merchant is liable to refund the amount to the cardholder in general if the credit card processing company is unable to collect this amount from the merchant the credit card processing company bears the loss for the amount of the credit or refund paid to the cardholder 

with regard to i above citi has the primary contingent liability with respect to its portfolio of privatelabel merchants the risk of loss is mitigated as the cash flows between citi and the merchant are settled on a net basis and citi has the right to offset any payments with cash flows otherwise due to the merchant to further mitigate this risk citi may delay settlement require a merchant to make an escrow deposit include event triggers to provide citi with more financial and operational control in the event of the financial deterioration of the merchant or require various credit enhancements including letters of credit and bank guarantees in the unlikely event that a privatelabel merchant is unable to deliver products services or a refund to its privatelabel cardholders citi is contingently liable to credit or refund cardholders 

with regard to ii above citi has a potential liability for bank card transactions where citi provides the transaction processing services as well as those where a third party provides the services and citi acts as a secondary guarantor should that processor fail to perform 

citi’s maximum potential contingent liability related to both bank card and privatelabel merchant processing services is estimated to be the total volume of credit card transactions that meet the requirements to be valid chargeback transactions at any given time at december 31 2016  and 2015  this maximum potential exposure was estimated to be 86 billion  and 84 billion  respectively 

however citi believes that the maximum exposure is not representative of the actual potential loss exposure based on its historical experience this contingent liability is unlikely to arise as most products and services are delivered when purchased and amounts are refunded when items are returned to merchants citi assesses the probability and amount of its contingent liability related to merchant processing based on the financial strength of the primary guarantor the extent and nature of unresolved chargebacks and its historical loss experience at december 31 2016  and 2015  the losses incurred and the carrying amounts of citi’s contingent obligations related to merchant processing activities were immaterial 

 

credit card arrangements with partners 

citi in certain of its credit card partner arrangements provides guarantees to the partner regarding the volume of certain customer originations during the term of the agreement to the extent such origination targets are not met the guarantees serve to compensate the partner for certain payments that otherwise would have been generated in connection with such originations 

custody indemnifications 

custody indemnifications are issued to guarantee that custody clients will be made whole in the event that a thirdparty subcustodian or depository institution fails to safeguard clients’ assets 

other guarantees and indemnifications 

credit card protection programs 

citi through its credit card businesses provides various cardholder protection programs on several of its card products including programs that provide insurance coverage for rental cars coverage for certain losses associated with purchased products price protection for certain purchases and protection for lost luggage these guarantees are not included in the table since the total outstanding amount of the guarantees and citi’s maximum exposure to loss cannot be quantified the protection is limited to certain types of purchases and losses and it is not possible to quantify the purchases that would qualify for these benefits at any given time citi assesses the probability and amount of its potential liability related to these programs based on the extent and nature of its historical loss experience at december 31 2016  and 2015  the actual and estimated losses incurred and the carrying value of citi’s obligations related to these programs were immaterial 

other representation and warranty indemnifications 

in the normal course of business citi provides standard representations and warranties to counterparties in contracts in connection with numerous transactions and also provides indemnifications including indemnifications that protect the counterparties to the contracts in the event that additional taxes are owed due either to a change in the tax law or an adverse interpretation of the tax law counterparties to these transactions provide citi with comparable indemnifications while such representations warranties and indemnifications are essential components of many contractual relationships they do not represent the underlying business purpose for the transactions the indemnification clauses are often standard contractual terms related to citi’s own performance under the terms of a contract and are entered into in the normal course of business based on an assessment that the risk of loss is remote often these clauses are intended to ensure that terms of a contract are met at inception no  compensation is received for these standard representations and warranties and it is not possible to determine their fair value because they rarely if ever result in a payment in many cases there are no  stated or notional amounts included in the indemnification clauses and the contingencies 

potentially triggering the obligation to indemnify have not occurred and are not expected to occur as a result these indemnifications are not included in the tables above 

valuetransfer networks 

citi is a member of or shareholder in hundreds of valuetransfer networks vtns payment clearing and settlement systems as well as exchanges around the world as a condition of membership many of these vtns require that members stand ready to pay a pro rata share of the losses incurred by the organization due to another member’s default on its obligations citi’s potential obligations may be limited to its membership interests in the vtns contributions to the vtn’s funds or in limited cases the obligation may be unlimited the maximum exposure cannot be estimated as this would require an assessment of future claims that have not yet occurred citi believes the risk of loss is remote given historical experience with the vtns accordingly citi’s participation in vtns is not reported in the guarantees tables above and there are no  amounts reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2016  or 2015  for potential obligations that could arise from citi’s involvement with vtn associations 

longterm care insurance indemnification 

in connection with the 2005 sale of certain insurance and annuity subsidiaries to metlife inc metlife the company provided an indemnification for policyholder claims and other liabilities relating to a book of longterm care ltc business for the entire term of the ltc policies that is fully reinsured by subsidiaries of genworth financial inc genworth in turn genworth has offsetting reinsurance agreements with metlife and the union fidelity life insurance company uflic a subsidiary of the general electric company genworth has funded two  trusts with securities whose fair value approximately 70 billion  at december 31 2016  compared to 63 billion  at december 31 2015  is designed to cover genworth’s statutory liabilities for the ltc policies the trusts serve as collateral for genworths reinsurance obligations related to the metlife ltc policies and metlife insurance company usa is the sole beneficiary of the trusts the assets in these trusts are evaluated and adjusted periodically to ensure that the fair value of the assets continues to cover the estimated statutory liabilities related to the ltc policies as those statutory liabilities change over time 

if genworth fails to perform under the reinsurance agreement for any reason including insolvency and the assets in the two  trusts are insufficient or unavailable to metlife then citi must reimburse metlife for any losses actually incurred in connection with the ltc policies since both events would have to occur before citi would become responsible for any payment to metlife pursuant to its indemnification obligation and the likelihood of such events occurring is currently not probable there is no  liability reflected in the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2016  and 2015  related to this indemnification citi continues to closely monitor its potential exposure under this indemnification obligation

futures and overthecounter derivatives clearing 

citi provides clearing services on central clearing counterparties ccps for clients that need to clear exchangetraded and overthecounter otc derivatives contracts based on all relevant facts and circumstances citi has concluded that it acts as an agent for accounting purposes in its role as clearing member for these client transactions as such citi does not reflect the underlying exchangetraded or otc derivatives contracts in its consolidated financial statements see note 22 for a discussion of citi’s derivatives activities that are reflected in its consolidated financial statements 

as a clearing member citi collects and remits cash and securities collateral margin between its clients and the respective ccp in certain circumstances citi collects a higher amount of cash or securities from its clients than it needs to remit to the ccps this excess cash is then held at depository institutions such as banks or carry brokers 

there are two  types of margin initial margin and variation margin where citi obtains benefits from or controls cash initial margin eg retains an interest spread cash initial margin collected from clients and remitted to the ccp or depository institutions is reflected within brokerage payables  payables to customers and brokerage receivables  receivables from brokers dealers and clearing organizations or cash and due from banks  respectively 

however for exchangetraded and otccleared derivatives contracts where citi does not obtain benefits from or control the client cash balances the client cash initial margin collected from clients and remitted to the ccp or depository institutions is not reflected on citi’s consolidated balance sheet these conditions are met when citi has contractually agreed with the client that i citi will pass through to the client all interest paid by the ccp or depository institutions on the cash initial margin ii citi will not utilize its right as a clearing member to transform cash margin into other assets iii citi does not guarantee and is not liable to the client for the performance of the ccp or the depository institution and iv the client cash balances are legally isolated from citi’s bankruptcy estate the total amount of cash initial margin collected and remitted in this manner was approximately 94 billion  and 43 billion  as of december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively 

variation margin due from clients to the respective ccp or from the ccp to clients reflects changes in the value of the client’s derivative contracts for each trading day as a clearing member citi is exposed to the risk of nonperformance by clients eg failure of a client to post variation margin to the ccp for negative changes in the value of the client’s derivative contracts in the event of 

nonperformance by a client citi would move to close out the client’s positions the ccp would typically utilize initial margin posted by the client and held by the ccp with any remaining shortfalls required to be paid by citi as clearing member citi generally holds incremental cash or securities margin posted by the client which would typically be expected to be sufficient to mitigate citi’s credit risk in the event the client fails to perform 

 as required by asc 86030255 securities collateral posted by clients is not recognized on citi’s consolidated balance sheet 

carrying value—guarantees and indemnifications 

at december 31 2016  and 2015  the total carrying amounts of the liabilities related to the guarantees and indemnifications included in the tables above amounted to approximately 12 billion  and  20 billion  respectively the carrying value of financial and performance guarantees is included in other liabilities for loans sold with recourse the carrying value of the liability is included in other liabilities  

 

collateral 

cash collateral available to citi to reimburse losses realized under these guarantees and indemnifications amounted to 45 billion  and 52 billion  at december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively securities and other marketable assets held as collateral amounted to 38 billion  and 33 billion  at december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively the majority of collateral is held to reimburse losses realized under securities lending indemnifications additionally letters of credit in favor of citi held as collateral amounted to 54 billion  and 42 billion  at december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively other property may also be available to citi to cover losses under certain guarantees and indemnifications however the value of such property has not been determined 

performance risk 

citi evaluates the performance risk of its guarantees based on the assigned referenced counterparty internal or external ratings where external ratings are used investmentgrade ratings are considered to be baabbb and above while anything below is considered noninvestment grade citi’s internal ratings are in line with the related external rating system on certain underlying referenced assets or entities ratings are not available such referenced assets are included in the “not rated” category the maximum potential amount of the future payments related to the outstanding guarantees is determined to be the notional amount of these contracts which is the par amount of the assets guaranteed 

presented in the tables below are the maximum potential amounts of future payments that are classified based upon internal and external credit ratings as previously mentioned the determination of the maximum potential future payments is based on the notional amount of the guarantees without consideration of possible recoveries under recourse provisions or from collateral held or pledged as such citi believes such amounts bear no relationship to the anticipated losses if any on these guarantees 





credit commitments and lines of credit 

the table below summarizes citigroup’s credit commitments 



the majority of unused commitments are contingent upon customers maintaining specific credit standards 

commercial commitments generally have floating interest rates and fixed expiration dates and may require payment of fees such fees net of certain direct costs are deferred and upon exercise of the commitment amortized over the life of the loan or if exercise is deemed remote amortized over the commitment period 

commercial and similar letters of credit

commercial real estate construction and land development 

commercial real estate construction and land development include unused portions of commitments to extend credit for the purpose of financing commercial and multifamily residential properties as well as land development projects 

 both securedbyrealestate and unsecured commitments are included in this line as well as undistributed loan proceeds where there is an obligation to advance for construction progress payments however this line only includes those extensions of credit that once funded will be classified as total loans net  on the consolidated balance sheet

commercial and other consumer loan commitments include overdraft and liquidity facilities as well as commercial commitments to make or purchase loans purchase thirdparty receivables provide note issuance or revolving underwriting facilities and invest in the form of equity 

other commitments and contingencies

27 contingencies 

accounting and disclosure framework 

asc 450 governs the disclosure and recognition of loss contingencies including potential losses from litigation and regulatory matters asc 450 defines a “loss contingency” as “an existing condition situation or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss to an entity that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur” it imposes different requirements for the recognition and disclosure of loss contingencies based on the likelihood of occurrence of the contingent future event or events it distinguishes among degrees of likelihood using the following three terms “probable” meaning that “the future event or events are likely to occur” “remote” meaning that “the chance of the future event or events occurring is slight” and “reasonably possible” meaning that “the chance of the future event or events occurring is more than remote but less than likely” these three terms are used below as defined in asc 450 

accruals  asc 450 requires accrual for a loss contingency when it is “probable that one or more future events will occur confirming the fact of loss” and  “the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated” in accordance with asc 450 citigroup establishes accruals for contingencies including the litigation and regulatory matters disclosed herein when citigroup believes it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated when the reasonable estimate of the loss is within a range of amounts the minimum amount of the range is accrued unless some higher amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range once established accruals are adjusted from time to time as appropriate in light of additional information the amount of loss ultimately incurred in relation to those matters may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts accrued for those matters 

disclosure  asc 450 requires disclosure of a loss contingency if “there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may have been incurred” and  there is no accrual for the loss because the conditions described above are not met or an exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount accrued in accordance with asc 450 if citigroup has not accrued for a matter because citigroup believes that a loss is reasonably possible but not probable or that a loss is probable but not reasonably estimable and the matter thus does not meet the criteria for accrual and the reasonably possible loss is material it discloses the loss contingency in addition citigroup discloses matters for which it has accrued if it believes a reasonably possible exposure to material loss exists in excess of the amount accrued in accordance with asc 450 citigroup’s disclosure includes an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss for those matters as to which an estimate can be made asc 450 does not require disclosure of an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss where an estimate cannot be made neither accrual nor disclosure is required for losses that are deemed remote 

 

litigation and regulatory contingencies 

overview  in addition to the matters described below in the ordinary course of business citigroup its affiliates and subsidiaries and current and former officers directors and employees for purposes of this section sometimes collectively referred to as citigroup and related parties routinely are named as defendants in or as parties to various legal actions and proceedings certain of these actions and proceedings assert claims or seek relief in connection with alleged violations of consumer protection fair lending securities banking antifraud antitrust antimoney laundering employment and other statutory and common laws certain of these actual or threatened legal actions and proceedings include claims for substantial or indeterminate compensatory or punitive damages or for injunctive relief and in some instances seek recovery on a classwide basis 

in the ordinary course of business citigroup and related parties also are subject to governmental and regulatory examinations informationgathering requests investigations and proceedings both formal and informal certain of which may result in adverse judgments settlements fines penalties restitution disgorgement injunctions or other relief in addition certain affiliates and subsidiaries of citigroup are banks registered brokerdealers futures commission merchants investment advisers or other regulated entities and in those capacities are subject to regulation by various us state and foreign securities banking commodity futures consumer protection and other regulators in connection with formal and informal inquiries by these regulators citigroup and such affiliates and subsidiaries receive numerous requests subpoenas and orders seeking documents testimony and other information in connection with various aspects of their regulated activities from time to time citigroup and related parties also receive grand jury subpoenas and other requests for information or assistance formal or informal from federal or state law enforcement agencies including among others various united states attorneys’ offices the asset forfeiture and money laundering section and other divisions of the department of justice the financial crimes enforcement network of the united states department of the treasury and the federal bureau of investigation relating to citigroup and its customers 

because of the global scope of citigroup’s operations and its presence in countries around the world citigroup and related parties are subject to litigation and governmental and regulatory examinations informationgathering requests and investigations and proceedings both formal and informal in multiple jurisdictions with legal and regulatory regimes that may differ substantially and present substantially different risks from those citigroup and related parties are subject to in the united states in some instances citigroup and related parties may be involved in proceedings involving the same subject matter in multiple jurisdictions which may result in overlapping cumulative or inconsistent outcomes 

citigroup seeks to resolve all litigation and regulatory matters in the manner management believes is in the best interests of citigroup and its shareholders and contests liability allegations of wrongdoing and where applicable the 

amount of damages or scope of any penalties or other relief sought as appropriate in each pending matter 

inherent uncertainty of the matters disclosed  certain of the matters disclosed below involve claims for substantial or indeterminate damages the claims asserted in these matters typically are broad often spanning a multiyear period and sometimes a wide range of business activities and the plaintiffs’ or claimants’ alleged damages frequently are not quantified or factually supported in the complaint or statement of claim other matters relate to regulatory investigations or proceedings as to which there may be no objective basis for quantifying the range of potential fine penalty or other remedy as a result citigroup is often unable to estimate the loss in such matters even if it believes that a loss is probable or reasonably possible until developments in the case or investigation have yielded additional information sufficient to support a quantitative assessment of the range of reasonably possible loss such developments may include among other things discovery from adverse parties or third parties rulings by the court on key issues analysis by retained experts and engagement in settlement negotiations depending on a range of factors such as the complexity of the facts the novelty of the legal theories the pace of discovery the court’s scheduling order the timing of court decisions and the adverse party’s willingness to negotiate in good faith toward a resolution it may be months or years after the filing of a case or commencement of an investigation before an estimate of the range of reasonably possible loss can be made 

matters as to which an estimate can be made  for some of the matters disclosed below citigroup is currently able to estimate a reasonably possible loss or range of loss in excess of amounts accrued if any for some of the matters included within this estimation an accrual has been made because a loss is believed to be both probable and reasonably estimable but an exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount accrued in these cases the estimate reflects the reasonably possible range of loss in excess of the accrued amount for other matters included within this estimation no accrual has been made because a loss although estimable is believed to be reasonably possible but not probable in these cases the estimate reflects the reasonably possible loss or range of loss as of december 31 2016 citigroup estimates that the reasonably possible unaccrued loss for these matters ranges up to approximately 30 billion  in the aggregate 

these estimates are based on currently available information as available information changes the matters for which citigroup is able to estimate will change and the estimates themselves will change in addition while many estimates presented in financial statements and other financial disclosures involve significant judgment and may be subject to significant uncertainty estimates of the range of reasonably possible loss arising from litigation and regulatory proceedings are subject to particular uncertainties for example at the time of making an estimate i citigroup may have only preliminary incomplete or inaccurate information about the facts underlying the claim ii its assumptions about the future rulings of the court or other tribunal on significant issues or the behavior and incentives of adverse parties or regulators may prove to be wrong and iii the outcomes it is 

 

attempting to predict are often not amenable to the use of statistical or other quantitative analytical tools in addition from time to time an outcome may occur that citigroup had not accounted for in its estimate because it had deemed such an outcome to be remote for all these reasons the amount of loss in excess of accruals ultimately incurred for the matters as to which an estimate has been made could be substantially higher or lower than the range of loss included in the estimate 

matters as to which an estimate cannot be made  for other matters disclosed below citigroup is not currently able to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss many of these matters remain in very preliminary stages even in some cases where a substantial period of time has passed since the commencement of the matter with few or no substantive legal decisions by the court or tribunal defining the scope of the claims the class if any or the potentially available damages and fact discovery is still in progress or has not yet begun in many of these matters citigroup has not yet answered the complaint or statement of claim or asserted its defenses nor has it engaged in any negotiations with the adverse party whether a regulator or a private party for all these reasons citigroup cannot at this time estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss if any for these matters 

opinion of management as to eventual outcome  subject to the foregoing it is the opinion of citigroup’s management based on current knowledge and after taking into account its current legal accruals that the eventual outcome of all matters described in this note would not be likely to have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition of citigroup nonetheless given the substantial or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and the inherent unpredictability of such matters an adverse outcome in certain of these matters could from time to time have a material adverse effect on citigroup’s consolidated results of operations or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods

managing global risk 

overview 

for citi effective risk management is of primary importance to its overall operations accordingly citi’s risk management process has been designed to monitor evaluate and manage the principal risks it assumes in conducting its activities specifically the activities that citi engages in and the risks those activities generate must be consistent with citi’s mission and value proposition the key principles that guide it and citis risk appetite 

risk management must be built on a foundation of ethical culture under citi’s mission and value proposition which was developed by citi’s senior leadership and distributed throughout the firm citi strives to serve as a trusted partner to its clients by responsibly providing financial services that enable growth and economic progress while earning and maintaining the public’s trust by constantly adhering to the highest ethical standards as such citi asks all employees to ensure that their decisions pass three tests they are in clients’ interests create economic value and are always systemically responsible additionally citi evaluates employees’ performance against behavioral expectations set out in citi’s leadership standards which were designed in part to effectuate citi’s mission and value proposition other culturerelated efforts in connection with conduct risk ethics and leadership escalation and treating customers fairly help citi to execute its mission and value proposition 

four key principles—common purpose responsible finance ingenuity and leadership—guide citi as it performs its mission citi’s risk appetite which is approved by the citigroup board of directors specifies the aggregate levels and types of risk the board and management are willing to assume to achieve citi’s strategic objectives and business plan consistent with applicable capital liquidity and other regulatory requirements 

citi selectively takes risks in support of its underlying business strategy while striving to ensure it operates within its mission and value proposition and risk appetite 

citi’s risks are generally categorized and summarized as follows 



 

 

citi manages its risks through each of its three lines of defense i business management ii independent control functions and iii internal audit the three lines of defense collaborate with each other in structured forums and processes to bring various perspectives together and to steer the organization toward outcomes that are in clients’ interests create economic value and are systemically responsible 

first line of defense business management 

each of citi’s businesses owns its risks and is responsible for assessing and managing its risks each business is also responsible for having controls in place to mitigate key risks assessing internal controls and promoting a culture of compliance and control in doing so a business is required to maintain appropriate staffing and implement appropriate procedures to fulfill its risk governance responsibilities 

the ceos of each region and business report to the citigroup ceo the head of operations and technology and the head of productivity who are considered part of the first line of defense also report to the citigroup ceo 

businesses at citi organize and chair many committees and councils that cover risk considerations with participation from independent control functions including committees or councils that are designed to consider matters related to capital assets and liabilities business practices business risks and controls mergers and acquisitions the community reinvestment act and fair lending and incentives 

second line of defense independent control functions 

citi’s independent control functions including risk compliance human resources legal and finance set 

standards by which citi and its businesses are expected to manage and oversee risks including compliance with applicable laws regulatory requirements policies and relevant standards of conduct additionally among other responsibilities the independent control functions provide advice and training to citi’s businesses and establish tools methodologies processes and oversight for controls used by the businesses to foster a culture of compliance and control 

risk 

the risk organization is designed to act as an independent partner of the business to manage market credit and operational risk in a manner consistent with citi’s risk appetite risk establishes policies and guidelines for risk assessments and risk management and contributes to controls and tools to manage measure and mitigate risks taken by the firm 

the chief risk officer reports to the citigroup ceo and the risk management committee of the citigroup board of directors the chief risk officer has regular and unrestricted access to the risk management committee of the board and also to the citigroup board of directors to address risks and issues identified through risk’s activities 

compliance 

the compliance organization is designed to protect citi not only by managing adherence to applicable laws regulations and other standards of conduct but also by promoting business behavior that is consistent with citi’s mission and value proposition the principle of responsible finance and citi’s compliance risk appetite for further information on citi’s compliance risk appetite see “compliance conduct and legal risk” below 

the chief compliance officer reports to the citigroup ceo and has regular and unrestricted access to the audit committee ethics and culture committee and other ad hoc committees of the citigroup board of directors to report on among other items possible breaches of citi’s compliance risk appetite 

human resources 

the human resources organization provides personnel support and governance in connection with among other things recognizing and rewarding employees who demonstrate citi’s values and excel in their roles and responsibilities setting ethical and performancerelated expectations and developing and promoting employees who meet those expectations and searching for assessing and hiring staff who exemplify citi’s leadership standards which outline citi’s expectations of its employees’ behavior 

the head of human resources reports to the citigroup ceo and interacts regularly with the personnel and compensation committee of the citigroup board of directors 

 

legal 

the legal organization is involved in a number of activities designed to promote the appropriate management of citi’s exposure to legal risk those activities include among others promoting and supporting citigroup’s governance processes advising businesses management other independent control functions the citigroup board of directors and committees of the board regarding analysis of laws and regulations regulatory matters disclosure matters and potential risks and exposures on key litigation and transactional matters among other things advising other independent control functions in their efforts to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations as well as other internal standards of conduct serving on key management committees reporting and escalating key legal issues to senior management or other independent control functions participating in internal investigations and overseeing regulatory investigations and advising businesses on a daytoday basis on legal regulatory and contractual matters 

the general counsel reports to the citigroup ceo and is responsible to the full citigroup board in addition to having regular and unrestricted access to the full citigroup board of directors the general counsel or his delegates regularly attends meetings of the risk management committee audit committee personnel and compensation committee ethics and culture committee operations and technology committee and nomination governance and public affairs committee as well as other ad hoc committees of the citigroup board of directors 

finance 

the finance organization is primarily comprised of the following disciplines treasury controllers tax and financial planning and analysis these disciplines partner with the businesses providing key data and consultation to facilitate sound decisions in support of the businesses’ objectives through these activities finance serves as an independent control function advising business management escalating identified risks and establishing policies or processes to manage risk 

through the treasury discipline finance has overall responsibility for managing citi’s balance sheet and accordingly partners with the businesses to manage citi’s liquidity and interest rate risk price risk for nontrading portfolios treasury works with the businesses to establish balance sheet targets and limits as well as sets policies on funding costs charged for business assets based on their liquidity and duration 

principally through the controllers discipline finance is responsible for establishing a strong control environment over citi’s financial reporting processes consistent with the 2013 committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission or coso internal control—integrated framework 

finance is led by citi’s chief financial officer cfo who reports directly to the citigroup ceo the cfo chairs or cochairs several management committees that serve as key governance and oversight forums for business activities in addition the cfo has regular and unrestricted access to the 

full citigroup board of directors as well as to the audit committee of the board of directors 

third line of defense internal audit 

citi’s internal audit function independently reviews activities of the first two lines of defense based on a riskbased audit plan and methodology approved by the audit committee of the citigroup board of directors internal audit also provides independent assurance to the citigroup board of directors the audit committee of the board senior management and regulators regarding the effectiveness of citi’s governance and controls designed to mitigate citi’s exposure to risks and to enhance citi’s culture of compliance and control 

 

the chief auditor reports functionally to the chairman of the citigroup audit committee and administratively to the ceo of citigroup internal audit’s responsibilities are carried out independently under the oversight of the audit committee internal audit’s employees accordingly report to the chief auditor and do not have reporting lines to frontline units or senior management internal audit’s staff members are not permitted to provide internalaudit services for a business line or function in which they had business line or function responsibilities within the previous 12 months 

citigroup board of directors and committees of the board 

citigroup’s board of directors oversees citi’s risktaking activities to do so directors review risk assessments and reports prepared by risk compliance human resources legal finance and internal audit and exercise independent judgment to question challenge and when necessary oppose recommendations and decisions made by senior management that could cause citi’s risk profile to exceed its risk appetite or jeopardize the safety and soundness of the firm 

the standing committees of the citigroup board of directors are the executive committee risk management committee audit committee personnel and compensation committee ethics and culture committee operations and technology committee and nomination governance and public affairs committee in addition to the standing committees the board creates ad hoc committees from time to time in response to regulatory legal or other requirements 

credit risk 

overview 

credit risk is the potential for financial loss resulting from the failure of a borrower or counterparty to honor its financial or contractual obligations credit risk arises in many of citigroup’s business activities including 

 

credit risk also arises from settlement and clearing activities when citi transfers an asset in advance of receiving its countervalue or advances funds to settle a transaction on behalf of a client concentration risk within credit risk is the risk associated with having credit exposure concentrated within a specific client industry region or other category 

credit risk is one of the most significant risks citi faces as an institution as a result citi has a wellestablished framework in place for managing credit risk across all businesses this includes a defined risk appetite credit limits and credit policies both at the business level as well as at the companywide level citi’s credit risk management also includes processes and policies with respect to problem recognition including “watch lists” portfolio review updated risk ratings and classification triggers 

with respect to citi’s settlement and clearing activities intraday client usage of lines is closely monitored against limits as well as against “normal” usage patterns to the extent a problem develops citi typically moves the client to a secured collateralized operating model generally citi’s intraday settlement and clearing lines are uncommitted and cancellable at any time 

to manage concentration of risk within credit risk citi has in place a concentration management framework consisting of industry limits obligor limits and singlename triggers in addition the independent risk organization reviews concentration of risk across citi’s regions and businesses to assist in managing this type of risk 

credit exposures are generally reported in notional terms for accrual loans reflecting the value at which the loans as well as loan and other offbalance sheet commitments are carried on the consolidated balance sheet credit exposure arising from capital markets activities is generally expressed as the current marktomarket net of margin reflecting the net value owed to citi by a given counterparty 

the credit risk associated with these credit exposures is a function of the creditworthiness of the obligor as well as the terms and conditions of the specific obligation citi assesses the credit risk associated with its credit exposures on a regular basis through its loan loss reserve process see “significant accounting policies and significant estimates” below and notes 1 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements as well as through regular stress testing at the company business geography and product levels these stresstesting processes typically estimate potential incremental credit costs that would 

 

occur as a result of either downgrades in the credit quality or defaults of the obligors or counterparties

consumer credit 

north america consumer mortgage lending 

overview 

citi’s north   america  consumer mortgage portfolio consists of both residential first mortgages and home equity loans at december 31 2015  citi’s north america  consumer mortgage portfolio was 797 billion compared to 959 billion at december 31 2014 of which the residential first mortgage portfolio was 569 billion compared to 678 billion at december 31 2014 and the home equity loan portfolio was 228 billion compared to 281 billion at december 31 2014 the decline during the year was primarily attributed to 147 billion of north america consumer mortgages sold or transferred to heldforsale including 66 billion of citifinancial consumer mortgages 54 billion of residential first mortgages and 12 billion of home equity loans transferred to heldforsale and classified as other assets  in the fourth quarter of 2015 at december 31 2015  187 billion of residential first mortgages were recorded in citi holdings with the remaining 382 billion recorded in citicorp at december 31 2015  191 billion of home equity loans was recorded in citi holdings with the remaining 36 billion recorded in citicorp 

citi’s residential first mortgage portfolio included 34 billion of loans with federal housing administration fha insurance or department of veterans affairs va guarantees at december 31 2015  compared to 52 billion at december 31 2014 the decline during the year was primarily due to mortgage loans with fha insurance sold or transferred to heldforsale citi’s fhava portfolio consists of loans to lowtomoderateincome borrowers with lower fico fair isaac corporation scores and generally higher loantovalue ratios ltvs credit losses on fha loans are borne by the sponsoring governmental agency provided that the insurance terms have not been rescinded as a result of an origination defect with respect to va loans the va establishes a loanlevel loss cap beyond which citi is liable for loss while fha and va loans have high delinquency rates given the insurance and guarantees respectively citi has experienced negligible credit losses on these loans 

as of december 31 2015  citi’s north   america  residential first mortgage portfolio contained approximately 24 billion of adjustable rate mortgages that are currently required to make a payment consisting of only accrued interest for the payment period or an interestonly payment compared to 38 billion at december 31 2014 this decline resulted primarily from repayments and conversions to amortizing loans residential first mortgages with this payment feature are primarily to highcreditquality borrowers who have on 

average significantly higher origination and refreshed fico scores than other loans in the residential first mortgage portfolio and have exhibited significantly lower 30 delinquency rates as compared with residential first mortgages without this payment feature as such citi does not believe the residential mortgage loans with this payment feature represent substantially higher risk in the portfolio 

citi does not offer optionadjustable rate mortgagesnegativeamortizing mortgage products to its customers as a result optionadjustable rate mortgagesnegativeamortizing mortgages represent an insignificant portion of total balances since they were acquired only incidentally as part of prior portfolio and business purchases

net credit losses in the north america residential first mortgage portfolio continued to improve during 2015 as a result of improvements in the home price index hpi and sales or transfers to heldforsale of residential first mortgages during 2015 as well as overall loss mitigation activities within citifinancial 

residential first mortgages originated by citifinancial have a higher net credit loss rate as citifinancial borrowers tend to have higher ltvs and lower fico scores than citimortgage borrowers citifinancial’s residential first mortgages also have a significantly different geographic distribution with different mortgage market conditions that tend to lag the overall improvements in hpi 

during 2015 continued management actions primarily the sale or transfer to heldforsale of approximately 15 billion of delinquent residential first mortgages including 09 billion in the fourth quarter largely associated with the transfer of citifinancial loans to heldforsale referenced above were the primary driver of the overall improvement in 

 

delinquencies within citi holdings’ residential first mortgage portfolio credit performance from quarter to quarter could continue to be impacted by the amount of delinquent loan sales or transfers to heldforsale as well as overall trends in hpi and interest rates

foreclosures 

a substantial majority of citi’s foreclosure inventory consists of residential first mortgages at december 31 2015  citi’s foreclosure inventory included approximately 01 billion or 02 of the total residential first mortgage portfolio compared to 06 billion or 09 at december 31 2014 based on the dollar amount of ending net receivables of loans in foreclosure inventory excluding loans that are guaranteed by us government agencies and loans subject to ltscs 

north america consumer mortgage quarterly credit trends—net credit losses and delinquencies—home equity loans 

citi’s home equity loan portfolio consists of both fixedrate home equity loans and loans extended under home equity lines of credit fixedrate home equity loans are fully amortizing home equity lines of credit allow for amounts to be drawn for a period of time with the payment of interest only and then at the end of the draw period the thenoutstanding amount is converted to an amortizing loan the interestonly payment feature during the revolving period is standard for this product across the industry after conversion the home equity loans typically have a 20year amortization period as of december 31 2015 citi’s home equity loan portfolio of 228 billion consisted of 63 billion of fixedrate home equity loans and 165 billion of loans extended under home equity lines of credit revolving helocs 

 

revolving helocs 

as noted above as of december 31 2015  citi had 165 billion of revolving helocs of which 42 billion had commenced amortization compared to 19 billion at december 31 2014 and 123 billion were still within their revolving period and have not commenced amortization or “reset” compared to 167 billion at december 31 2014 the following chart indicates the fico and combined loantovalue cltv characteristics of citi’s revolving helocs portfolio and the year in which they reset 

note totals may not sum due to rounding 

approximately 25 of citi’s total revolving helocs portfolio had commenced amortization as of december 31 2015  compared to 10 as of december 31 2014 of the remaining revolving helocs portfolio approximately 66 will commence amortization during the period of 2016–2017 before commencing amortization revolving heloc borrowers are required to pay only interest on their loans upon amortization these borrowers will be required to pay both interest usually at a variable rate and principal that amortizes typically over 20 years rather than the typical 30year amortization as a result citi’s customers with revolving helocs that reset could experience “payment shock” due to the higher required payments on the loans 

while it is not certain what ultimate impact this payment shock could have on citi’s delinquency rates and net credit losses citi currently estimates that the monthly loan payment for its revolving helocs that reset during the period of 2016–2017 could increase on average by approximately 370 or 165 increases in interest rates could further increase these payments given the variable nature of the interest rates on these loans postreset of the revolving helocs that will commence amortization during the period of 2016–2017 approximately 06 billion or 8 of the loans have a cltv greater than 100 as of december 31 2015  borrowers’ high loantovalue positions as well as the cost and availability of refinancing options could limit borrowers’ ability to refinance their revolving helocs as these loans begin to reset 

approximately 67 of the revolving helocs that have begun amortization as of december 31 2015 were 30 days past due compared to 32 of the total outstanding home equity loan portfolio amortizing and nonamortizing this compared to 64 and 27 respectively as of december 31 

 

2014 as newly amortizing loans continue to season the delinquency rate of the amortizing revolving heloc portfolio and total home equity loan portfolio is expected to continue to increase in addition resets to date have generally occurred during a period of historically low interest rates which citi believes has likely reduced the overall “payment shock” to the borrower 

citi continues to monitor this reset risk closely and will continue to consider any potential impact in determining its allowance for loan loss reserves in addition management continues to review and take additional actions to offset potential reset risk such as a borrower outreach program to provide reset risk education and proactively working with highrisk borrowers through a specialized single point of contact unit for further information on reset risk see “risk factors—credit and market risks” above 

net credit losses and delinquencies 

the following charts detail the quarterly credit trends for citi’s home equity loan portfolio in north america  





note totals may not sum due to rounding 



note totals may not sum due to rounding 

 

as evidenced by the tables above net credit losses in the north america  home equity loan portfolio continued to improve during 2015 largely driven by the continued improvement in hpi delinquencies in the portfolio also improved during 2015 primarily due to liquidations and continued management actions including the transfer of citifinancial home equity loans to heldforsale in the fourth quarter of 2015 and continued modifications partially offset by increased delinquencies associated with the increase in revolving helocs commencing amortization 

given the limited market in which to sell delinquent home equity loans to date as well as the relatively smaller number of home equity loan modifications and modification programs see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements citi’s ability to reduce delinquencies or net credit losses in its home equity loan portfolio in citi holdings whether pursuant to deterioration of the underlying credit performance of these loans the reset of the revolving helocs as discussed above or otherwise is more limited as compared to residential first mortgages

portfolio mix—geography counterparty and industry 

citi’s corporate credit portfolio is diverse across geography and counterparty the following table shows the percentage by region based on citi’s internal management geography 



the maintenance of accurate and consistent risk ratings across the corporate credit portfolio facilitates the comparison of credit exposure across all lines of business geographic regions and products counterparty risk ratings reflect an estimated probability of default for a counterparty and are derived primarily through the use of validated statistical models scorecard models and external agency ratings under defined circumstances in combination with consideration of factors specific to the obligor or market such as management experience competitive position regulatory environment and commodity prices facility risk ratings are assigned that reflect the probability of default of 

 

the obligor and factors that affect the lossgivendefault of the facility such as support or collateral internal obligor ratings that generally correspond to bbb and above are 

considered investment grade while those below are considered noninvestment grade 

citigroup also has incorporated climate risk assessment and reporting criteria for certain obligors as necessary factors evaluated include consideration of climate risk to an 

obligor’s business and physical assets and when relevant consideration of costeffective options to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 

the following table presents the corporate credit portfolio by facility risk rating as a percentage of the total corporate credit portfolio 



note total exposure includes direct outstandings and unfunded lending commitments 

citi’s corporate credit portfolio is also diversified by industry the following table shows the allocation of citi’s total corporate credit portfolio by industry 



note total exposure includes direct outstandings and unfunded lending commitments 

1 in addition to this exposure citi has energyrelated exposure within the “public sector” eg energyrelated stateowned entities and “transportation and industrial” sector eg offshore drilling entities included in the table above as of december 31 2015 citi’s total exposure to these energyrelated entities remained largely consistent with the prior quarter at approximately 6 billion of which approximately 4 billion consisted of direct outstanding funded loans 

exposure to the energy and energyrelated sector 

as of december 31 2015 citi’s total corporate credit exposure to the energy and energyrelated sector see footnote 1 to the table above was approximately 58 billion with approximately 21 billion or 3 of citi’s total outstanding loans consisting of direct outstanding funded loans this compared to approximately 61 billion of total corporate credit exposure and 21 billion of direct outstanding funded loans as of september 30 2015 in addition as of december 31 2015 approximately 72 of citi’s total corporate credit energy and energyrelated exposure was in the united states united kingdom and canada compared to approximately 73 at september 30 2015 also as of december 31 2015 approximately 80 of citi’s total energy and energyrelated exposures were rated investment grade compared to approximately 79 as of september 30 2015 

during the fourth quarter of 2015 citi built additional energy and energyrelated loan loss reserves of approximately 250 million and incurred approximately 75 million of net credit losses in these portfolios for the full year 2015 citi built net loan loss reserves against energy and energyrelated exposures by approximately 530 

 

million and incurred net credit losses of approximately 95 million as of december 31 2015 citi held loan loss reserves against its funded energy and energyrelated loans equal to approximately 38 of these loans for additional information on energy and energyrelated reserving actions in  icg  see “institutional clients group”  above 

exposure to banks brokerdealers and finance companies 

as of december 31 2015 citi’s total corporate credit exposure to banks brokerdealers and finance companies was approximately 42 billion of which 29 billion represented direct outstanding funded loans or 5 of citi’s total outstanding loans these amounts were mostly unchanged when compared to 43 billion of total corporate credit exposure and 29 billion of direct outstanding funded loans to banks brokerdealers and finance companies as of september 30 2015 also as of december 31 2015 approximately 84 of citi’s bank brokerdealers and finance companies total corporate credit exposure was rated investment grade 

included in the amounts noted above citi’s total corporate credit exposure to banks was approximately 26 billion as of december 31 2015 and was not concentrated in any particular geographic region of this exposure more than 70 had a tenor of less than 12 months as of december 31 2015 citi’s direct outstanding funded loans to banks was 21 billion or 3 of citi’s total outstanding loans 

in addition to the corporate lending exposures described above citi has additional exposure to banks brokerdealers and finance companies in the form of derivatives and securities financing transactions which are typically executed as repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements or securities loaned or borrowed arrangements as of december 31 2015 citi had net derivative credit exposure to banks broker dealers and finance companies of approximately 5 billion after the application of netting arrangements legally enforceable margin agreements and other collateral arrangements the collateral considered as part of the net derivative credit exposure was represented primarily by high quality liquid assets as of december 31 2015 citi had net credit exposure to banks brokerdealers and finance companies in the form of securities financing transactions of 7 billion after the application of netting and collateral arrangements the collateral considered in the net exposure for the securities financing transactions exposure was primarily cash and highly liquid investment grade securities 

credit risk mitigation 

as part of its overall risk management activities citigroup uses credit derivatives and other risk mitigants to hedge portions of the credit risk in its corporate credit portfolio in addition to outright asset sales the results of the marktomarket and any realized gains or losses on credit derivatives are reflected primarily in other revenue  on the consolidated statement of income 

at december 31 2015  september 30 2015  and december 31 2014  345 billion 330 billion and 276 billion respectively of the corporate credit portfolio was economically hedged citigroup’s expected loss model used in the calculation of its loan loss reserve does not include the favorable impact of credit derivatives and other mitigants that are marked to market in addition the reported amounts of direct outstandings and unfunded lending commitments in the tables above do not reflect the impact of these hedging transactions the credit protection was economically hedging underlying corporate credit portfolio exposures with the following risk rating distribution

liquidity risk 

overview 

adequate and diverse sources of funding and liquidity are essential to citi’s businesses funding and liquidity risks arise from several factors many of which are mostly or entirely outside citi’s control such as disruptions in the financial markets changes in key funding sources credit spreads changes in citi’s credit ratings and political and economic conditions in certain countries for additional information see “risk factors” above 

citi’s funding and liquidity objectives are aimed at i funding its existing asset base ii growing its core businesses in citicorp iii maintaining sufficient liquidity structured appropriately so that citi can operate under a variety of adverse circumstances including potential firmspecific andor market liquidity events in varying durations and severity and iv satisfying regulatory requirements citigroup’s primary liquidity objectives are established by entity and in aggregate across two major categories 

  

 

at an aggregate level citigroup’s goal is to maintain sufficient funding in amount and tenor to fully fund customer assets and to provide an appropriate amount of cash and highquality liquid assets as discussed further below even in times of stress the liquidity risk management framework provides that certain entities be selfsufficient or net providers of liquidity including in conditions established under their designated stress tests 

 

citi’s primary sources of funding include i deposits via citi’s bank subsidiaries which are citi’s most stable and lowest cost source of longterm funding ii longterm debt primarily senior and subordinated debt primarily issued at the parent and certain bank subsidiaries and iii stockholders’ equity these sources may be supplemented by shortterm borrowings primarily in the form of secured funding transactions 

as referenced above citigroup works to ensure that the structural tenor of these funding sources is sufficiently long in relation to the tenor of its asset base the goal of citi’s assetliability management is to ensure that there is excess tenor in the liability structure relative to the liquidity profile of the assets this reduces the risk that liabilities will become due before asset maturities or monetizations through sale and in turn generates liquidity this liquidity is held primarily in the form of highquality liquid assets hqla as set forth in the table below 

citi’s treasurer has overall responsibility for management of citi’s hqla citi’s liquidity is managed via a centralized treasury model by corporate treasury in conjunction with regional and incountry treasurers pursuant to this approach citi’s hqla is managed with emphasis on assetliability management and entitylevel liquidity adequacy throughout citi 

citi’s chief risk officer is responsible for the overall risk profile of citi’s hqla the chief risk officer and citi’s cfo cochair citi’s asset liability management committee alco which includes citi’s treasurer and other senior executives alco sets the strategy of the liquidity portfolio and monitors its performance significant changes to portfolio asset allocations need to be approved by alco 

highquality liquid assets hqla 



note amounts set forth in the table above are as of period end and may increase or decrease intraperiod in the ordinary course of business for securities the amounts represent the liquidity value that potentially could be realized and thus exclude any securities that are encumbered as well as the haircuts that would be required for securities financing transactions 

 korea and mexico 

as set forth in the table above citi’s hqla decreased both yearoveryear as well as sequentially driven primarily by reductions in longterm debt and shortterm borrowings as discussed further under “secured funding transactions and shortterm borrowings” below 

citi’s hqla as set forth above does not include citi’s available borrowing capacity from the federal home loan banks fhlb of which citi is a member which was approximately 36 billion as of december 31 2015 unchanged from september 30 2015 and compared to 26 billion as of december 31 2014 and maintained by eligible collateral pledged to such banks the hqla also does not include citi’s borrowing capacity at the us federal reserve bank discount window or other central banks which would be in addition to the resources noted above 

in general citi’s liquidity is fungible across legal entities within its bank group citi’s bank subsidiaries including citibank can lend to the citi parent and brokerdealer entities in accordance with section 23a of the federal reserve act as of december 31 2015 the capacity available for lending to these entities under section 23a was approximately 17 billion largely unchanged from prior periods subject to certain eligible noncash collateral requirements 

loans 

as part of its funding and liquidity objectives citi seeks to fund its existing asset base appropriately as well as maintain sufficient liquidity to grow its core businesses in citicorp including its loan portfolio citi maintains a diversified portfolio of loans to its consumer and institutional clients the table below sets forth the endofperiod loans by business andor segment and the total average loans for each of the periods indicated 



 

 

endofperiod loans declined 4 yearoveryear and 1 quarteroverquarter excluding the impact of fx translation citigroup’s endofperiod loans decreased 1 both yearoveryear and sequentially in each case driven by continued overall declines in citi holdings 

excluding the impact of fx translation citicorp loans increased 5 yearoveryear gcb  loans grew 2 yearoveryear driven by 3 growth in north america  icg  loans increased 8 yearoveryear within icg  corporate loans increased 9 driven by both new business and the funding of prior commitments treasury and trade solutions loans declined 3 as citi continued to distribute a significant portion of its trade loan originations which allows it to support its clients while maintaining balance sheet discipline in a continued low spread environment private bank markets and securities services and other loans grew 14 yearoveryear 

citi holdings loans decreased 43 yearoveryear driven by over 21 billion of reductions in north america  mortgages including transfers to heldforsale see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements as well as the sale of onemain financial which was completed during the fourth quarter of 2015 

deposits 

deposits are citi’s primary and lowest cost funding source the table below sets forth the endofperiod deposits by business andor segment and the total average deposits for each of the periods indicated 



 

endofperiod deposits increased 1 yearoveryear and remained relatively unchanged quarteroverquarter excluding the impact of fx translation citigroup’s endofperiod deposits increased 4 yearoveryear and 1 sequentially despite significant reductions in citi holdings deposits from the prioryear period 

excluding the impact of fx translation citicorp deposits grew 5 yearoveryear within citicorp gcb  deposits increased 2 yearoveryear driven by 5 growth in international deposits icg  deposits increased 9 yearoveryear with continued deposit growth in treasury and trade solutions and the private bank 

the decline in citi holdings deposits from the prioryear period was primarily driven by the nowcomplete transfer of morgan stanley smith barney mssb deposits to morgan stanley 

citi monitors its deposit base across multiple dimensions including what citi refers to as “lcr value” or the liquidity value of the deposit base under the us lcr rules as discussed under “shortterm liquidity measurement liquidity coverage ratio lcr” below citi defines the liquidity value of deposits as the percentage of deposits assumed to remain following a 30day period of liquidity stress as discussed below under the lcr rules deposits are assigned liquidity values based on expected behavior under stress determined by the type of deposit and the type of client generally the lcr rules prioritize transactional and operating accounts of consumers including retail and commercial banking deposits and corporations respectively while assigning lower liquidity values to nonoperating deposit balances of financial institutions as of december 31 2015 citi’s total deposits had an aggregate liquidity value of approximately 73 down slightly sequentially and unchanged from december 31 2014 within the 73 total liquidity value as of yearend 2015 citi’s gcb  deposits had a liquidity value of approximately 87 and icg  deposits including corporateother  had a liquidity value of approximately 66 

longterm debt 

longterm debt generally defined as debt with original maturities of one year or more represents the most significant component of citi’s funding for the parent entities and is a supplementary source of funding for the bank entities 

longterm debt is an important funding source due in part to its multiyear contractual maturity structure the weightedaverage maturities of unsecured longterm debt issued by citigroup and its affiliates including citibank with a remaining life greater than one year excluding remaining trust preferred securities outstanding was approximately 69 years as of december 31 2015  unchanged from the prioryear period and a slight increase sequentially due in part to the issuance of longerdated debt securities and the redemption of shorterdated debt securities during the fourth quarter of 2015 

citi’s longterm debt outstanding at the parent includes senior and subordinated debt and what citi refers to as customerrelated debt consisting of structured notes such as equity and creditlinked notes as well as nonstructured notes citi’s issuance of customerrelated debt is generally 

 

driven by customer demand and supplements benchmark debt issuance as a source of funding for citi’s parent entities citi’s longterm debt at the bank also includes fhlb advances and securitizations 

longterm debt outstanding 

the following table sets forth citi’s total longterm debt outstanding for the periods indicated 



note amounts represent the current value of longterm debt on citi’s consolidated balance sheet which for certain debt instruments includes consideration of fair value hedging impacts and unamortized discounts and premiums 

 

citi’s total longterm debt outstanding decreased both yearoveryear and quarteroverquarter primarily due to significant buybacks of senior and subordinated debt at the parent level during the fourth quarter of 2015 discussed below as well as continued reductions in securitizations at the bank entities 

as part of its liability management citi has considered and may continue to consider opportunities to repurchase its longterm debt pursuant to open market purchases tender offers or other means such repurchases help reduce citi’s overall funding costs and assist it in meeting regulatory changes and requirements during 2015 citi repurchased an aggregate of approximately 211 billion of its outstanding longterm debt including early redemptions of fhlb advances of this amount approximately 115 billion was repurchased in the fourth quarter of 2015 as citi completed significant asset sales in citi holdings including the onemain financial business accordingly while citi anticipates continued liability management activities in 2016 it does not currently expect repurchases to remain at the level experienced in 2015 

longterm debt issuances and maturities 

the table below details citi’s longterm debt issuances and maturities including repurchases and redemptions during the periods presented 



the table below shows citi’s aggregate longterm debt maturities including repurchases and redemptions in 2015 as well as its aggregate expected annual longterm debt maturities as of december 31 2015  

total lossabsorbing capacity   tlac 

in november 2015 the federal reserve board issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that would impose minimum lossabsorbing capacity and longterm debt requirements on global systemically important bank holding companies gsibs including citi the intended purpose of which would be to facilitate the orderly resolution of us gsibs under the us bankruptcy code and title ii of the doddfrank act there are significant uncertainties and interpretive issues arising from the federal reserve board’s proposal for additional information see “risk factors—liquidity risks” above for an additional discussion of the method 1 and method 2 gsib capital surcharge methodology as well as other regulatory capital aspects of the tlac proposal see “capital resources” above 

pursuant to the proposal us gsibs would be required to issue and maintain minimum levels of external tlac and eligible longterm debt ltd each set by reference to the gsib’s consolidated riskweighted assets rwa and total leverage exposure the proposed minimum external tlac requirement would be the greater of i 18 of the gsib’s rwa plus the applicable external tlac buffer and ii 95 of its total leverage exposure the applicable external tlac buffer equals the 25 capital conservation buffer plus any applicable countercyclical capital buffer plus the gsib’s capital surcharge as determined under method 1 of the gsib surcharge rule accordingly citi’s total estimated current tlac requirement would be 225 of rwa under the proposal breach of the proposed external tlac buffer would subject the gsib to restrictions on distributions and discretionary bonus payments the proposed minimum external ltd requirement would be the greater of i 6 of the gsib’s rwa plus its capital surcharge as determined under method 2 of the gsib surcharge rule for a total estimated current requirement of 9 of rwa for citi and ii 45 of the gsib’s total leverage exposure 

as proposed external tlac would generally include i common equity tier 1 capital and additional tier 1 capital issued directly by the bank holding company plus ii eligible external ltd eligible external ltd which is a subcategory of external tlac would include unsecured “plain vanilla” debt securities ie would not include structured notes or securities containing derivativelinked features issued directly by the bank holding company governed by us law and with a remaining maturity greater than one year further pursuant to what has been referred to as the “haircut” provision otherwise eligible external ltd with a remaining maturity of less than two years would be subject to a 50 haircut for purposes of meeting the minimum external ltd requirement in addition otherwise eligible external ltd which provides for acceleration of the payment of principal and interest other than upon the occurrence of insolvency or nonpayment would not be eligible ltd   

designed to further enhance the resolvability of a us gsib the proposal would also prohibit or limit certain financial arrangements at the bank holding company level or what are referred to as “clean holding company” requirements pursuant to these requirements the bank holding company 

 

would be prohibited from having certain types of thirdparty liabilities including shortterm debt derivatives and other qualified financial contracts liabilities guaranteed by a subsidiary ie upstream guarantees and guarantees of subsidiary liabilities or similar arrangements if the liability or guarantee includes a default right linked to the insolvency of the bank holding company ie downstream guarantees with cross default provisions in addition the clean holding company requirements would limit the thirdparty noncontingent liabilities of the bank holding company that are not related to tlac or ltd and are pari passu with or junior to eligible external ltd including structured notes and various operating liabilities to 5 of the us gsib’s outstanding external tlac 

the proposal would further require that us gsibs deduct from their regulatory capital any investment in unsecured debt issued by gsibs in excess of certain thresholds this deduction would be required regardless of the tenor of the instrument and regardless of whether the debt instrument would qualify as eligible external ltd 

while not included in its proposed requirements the federal reserve board also indicated in its notice of proposed rulemaking that it was considering imposing “domestic internal tlac” requirements for the material operating subsidiaries of us gsibs the board indicated any such requirements would be designed to among other things require the maintenance of “contributable resources” in the form of highquality liquid assets at the bank holding company andor “prepositioned resources” at the level of the material operating subsidiaries in the form of debt and equity investments in the subsidiaries 

the proposed effective date for the requirements included in the proposal would be january 1 2019 with the exception of the rwa component of the external tlac requirement which would be 16 as of january 1 2019 and would increase to 18 on january 1 2022 

secured funding transactions and shortterm borrowings 

as referenced above citi supplements its primary sources of funding with shortterm borrowings shortterm borrowings generally include i secured funding transactions securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase or repos and ii to a lesser extent shortterm borrowings consisting of commercial paper and borrowings from the fhlb and other market participants see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on citigroup’s and its affiliates’ outstanding shortterm borrowings citi has purposefully reduced its other shortterm borrowings including fhlb borrowings as it continued to grow its highquality deposits 

secured funding 

secured funding is primarily accessed through citi’s brokerdealer subsidiaries to fund efficiently both secured lending activity and a portion of securities inventory held in the context of market making and customer activities citi also executes a smaller portion of its secured funding transactions through its bank entities which is typically collateralized by foreign government debt securities generally daily changes 

in the level of citi’s secured funding are primarily due to fluctuations in secured lending activity in the matched book as described below and securities inventory 

secured funding of 146 billion as of december 31 2015 declined 16 from the prioryear period and 13 sequentially excluding the impact of fx translation secured funding decreased 11 from the prioryear period and 12 sequentially both driven by normal business activity average balances for secured funding were approximately 163   billion for the quarter ended december 31 2015 

the portion of secured funding in the brokerdealer subsidiaries that funds secured lending is commonly referred to as “matched book” activity the majority of this activity is secured by high quality liquid securities such as us treasury securities us agency securities and foreign government debt securities other secured funding is secured by less liquid securities including equity securities corporate bonds and assetbacked securities the tenor of citi’s matched book liabilities is generally equal to or longer than the tenor of the 

 

corresponding matched book assets 

the remainder of the secured funding activity in the brokerdealer subsidiaries serves to fund securities inventory held in the context of market making and customer activities to maintain reliable funding under a wide range of market conditions including under periods of stress citi manages these activities by taking into consideration the quality of the underlying collateral and stipulating financing tenor the weighted average maturity of citi’s secured funding of less liquid securities inventory was greater than 110 days as of december 31 2015 

citi manages the risks in its secured funding by conducting daily stress tests to account for changes in capacity tenors haircut collateral profile and client actions additionally citi maintains counterparty diversification by establishing concentration triggers and assessing counterparty reliability and stability under stress citi generally sources 

secured funding from more than 150 counterparties 

the following table contains the yearend average and maximum monthend amounts for the following respective shortterm borrowings categories at the end of each of the three prior fiscal years

liquidity monitoring and measurement 

stress testing 

liquidity stress testing is performed for each of citi’s major entities operating subsidiaries andor countries stress testing and scenario analyses are intended to quantify the potential impact of a liquidity event on the balance sheet and liquidity position and to identify viable funding alternatives that can be utilized these scenarios include assumptions about significant changes in key funding sources market triggers such as credit ratings potential uses of funding and political and economic conditions in certain countries these conditions include expected and stressed market conditions as well as companyspecific events 

liquidity stress tests are conducted to ascertain potential mismatches between liquidity sources and uses over a variety of time horizons overnight one week two weeks one month three months one year and over a variety of stressed conditions liquidity limits are set accordingly to monitor the liquidity of an entity these stress tests and potential mismatches are calculated with varying frequencies with several tests performed daily 

given the range of potential stresses citi maintains a series of contingency funding plans on a consolidated basis and for individual entities these plans specify a wide range of readily available actions for a variety of adverse market conditions or idiosyncratic stresses 

shortterm liquidity measurement liquidity coverage ratio lcr 

in addition to internal measures that citi has developed for a 30day stress scenario citi also monitors its liquidity by reference to the lcr as calculated pursuant to the us lcr rules 

generally the lcr is designed to ensure that banks maintain an adequate level of hqla to meet liquidity needs under an acute 30day stress scenario the lcr is calculated by dividing hqla by estimated net outflows over a stressed 30day period with the net outflows determined by applying prescribed outflow factors to various categories of liabilities such as deposits unsecured and secured wholesale borrowings unused lending commitments and derivativesrelated exposures partially offset by inflows from assets maturing within 30 days banks are required to calculate an addon to address potential maturity mismatches between contractual cash outflows and inflows within the 30day period in determining the total amount of net outflows the minimum lcr requirement is 90 effective january 2016 increasing to 100 in january 2017 

the table below sets forth the components of citi’s lcr calculation and hqla in excess of net outflows as of the 

 

periods indicated 



as set forth in the table above citi’s lcr was unchanged both yearoveryear and quarteroverquarter   as the reduction in citi’s hqla was offset by a reduction in net outflows reflecting reductions in citi’s longterm debt and shortterm borrowings 

longterm liquidity measurement net stable funding ratio nsfr 

for 12month liquidity stress periods citi uses several measures including its internal longterm liquidity measure based on a 12month scenario assuming deterioration due to a combination of idiosyncratic and market stresses of moderate to high severity it is broadly defined as the ratio of unencumbered liquidity resources to net stressed cumulative outflows over a 12month period 

in addition in october 2014 the basel committee on banking supervision basel committee issued final standards for the implementation of the basel iii nsfr with full compliance required by january 1 2018 similar to citi’s internal longterm liquidity measure the nsfr is intended to measure the stability of a banking organization’s funding over a oneyear time horizon pursuant to the basel committee’s final standards the nsfr is calculated by dividing the level of a bank’s available stable funding by its required stable funding the ratio is required to be greater than 100 under the basel committee standards available stable funding primarily includes portions of equity deposits and longterm debt while required stable funding primarily includes the portion of longterm assets which are deemed illiquid the us banking agencies have not yet proposed the us version of the nsfr although a proposal is expected during 2016 

credit ratings 

citigroup’s funding and liquidity its funding capacity ability to access capital markets and other sources of funds the cost of these funds and its ability to maintain certain deposits are partially dependent on its credit ratings 

the table below sets forth the ratings for citigroup and citibank as of december 31 2015  while not included in the table below the longterm and shortterm ratings of citigroup global markets inc cgmi were aa1 at standard  poor’s and af1 at fitch as of december 31 2015  the longterm and shortterm ratings of citigroup global markets holdings inc cgmhi were bbba2 at standard  poor’s and a 

f1 at fitch as of december 31 2015 



recent credit rating developments 

on december 8 2015 fitch affirmed citigroup inc’s viability rating vr and longterm issuer default rating idr at ‘aa’ respectively at the same time fitch affirmed citibank’s vr and idr at ‘aa’ respectively the outlooks for the longterm idrs are stable 

on december 2 2015 as expected sp downgraded the holding company ratings of all eight us gsibs including citigroup inc by one notch reflecting its view of the likelihood of extraordinary government support to be “uncertain” as a result citigroup incs longterm rating now stands at bbb and the outlook was upgraded to stable the shortterm rating of citigroup inc remained at a2 the operating company ratings of the gsibs including citibank na and citigroup global markets inc remained unchanged with a “watch positive” outlook as sp waits for further clarity from the regulators regarding tlac eligibility of certain instruments sp has stated it expects to conclude its credit watch within the first half of 2016 

potential impacts of ratings downgrades 

ratings downgrades by moody’s fitch or sp could negatively impact citigroup’s andor citibank’s funding and liquidity due to reduced funding capacity including derivatives triggers which could take the form of cash obligations and collateral requirements 

the following information is provided for the purpose of analyzing the potential funding and liquidity impact to citigroup and citibank of a hypothetical simultaneous 

ratings downgrade across all three major rating agencies this analysis is subject to certain estimates estimation methodologies and judgments and uncertainties uncertainties include potential ratings limitations that certain entities may have with respect to permissible counterparties as well as general subjective counterparty behavior for example certain corporate customers and markets counterparties could re 

 

evaluate their business relationships with citi and limit transactions in certain contracts or market instruments with citi changes in counterparty behavior could impact citi’s funding and liquidity as well as the results of operations of certain of its businesses the actual impact to citigroup or citibank is unpredictable and may differ materially from the potential funding and liquidity impacts described below for additional information on the impact of credit rating changes on citi and its applicable subsidiaries see “risk factors—liquidity risks” above 

citigroup inc and citibank—potential derivative triggers 

as of december 31 2015  citi estimates that a hypothetical onenotch downgrade of the senior debtlongterm rating of citigroup inc across all three major rating agencies could impact citigroup’s funding and liquidity due to derivative triggers by approximately 06 billion compared to 07 billion as of september 30 2015 other funding sources such as securities financing transactions and other margin requirements for which there are no explicit triggers could also be adversely affected 

as of december 31 2015  citi estimates that a hypothetical onenotch downgrade of the senior debtlongterm rating of citibank across all three major rating agencies could impact citibank’s funding and liquidity by approximately 13 billion compared to 15 billion as of september 30 2015 due to derivative triggers 

in total citi estimates that a onenotch downgrade of citigroup and citibank across all three major rating agencies could result in aggregate cash obligations and collateral requirements of approximately 19 billion compared to 22 billion as of september 30 2015 see also note 23 to the consolidated financial statements as set forth under “highquality liquid assets” above the liquidity resources of citibank were approximately 312 billion and the liquidity resources of citi’s nonbank and other entities were approximately 66 billion for a total of approximately 379 billion as of december 31 2015  these liquidity resources are available in part as a contingency for the potential events described above 

in addition a broad range of mitigating actions are currently included in citigroup’s and citibank’s contingency funding plans for citigroup these mitigating factors include but are not limited to accessing surplus funding capacity from existing clients tailoring levels of secured lending and adjusting the size of select trading books and collateralized borrowings from certain citibank subsidiaries mitigating actions available to citibank include but are not limited to selling or financing highly liquid government securities tailoring levels of secured lending adjusting the size of select trading assets reducing loan originations and renewals raising additional deposits or borrowing from the fhlb or central banks citi believes these mitigating actions could substantially reduce the funding and liquidity risk if any of the potential downgrades described above 

citibank—additional potential impacts 

in addition to the above derivative triggers citi believes that a potential onenotch downgrade of citibank’s senior debtlongterm rating by sp could also have an adverse impact on the commercial papershortterm rating of citibank as of december 31 2015  citibank had liquidity commitments of approximately 100 billion to consolidated assetbacked commercial paper conduits compared to 94 billion as of september 30 2015 as referenced in note 22  to the consolidated financial statements 

in addition to the abovereferenced liquidity resources of certain citibank and banamex entities citibank could reduce the funding and liquidity risk if any of the potential downgrades described above through mitigating actions including repricing or reducing certain commitments to commercial paper conduits in the event of the potential downgrades described above citi believes that certain corporate customers could reevaluate their deposit relationships with citibank this reevaluation could result in clients adjusting their discretionary deposit levels or changing their depository institution which could potentially reduce certain deposit levels at citibank however citi could choose to adjust pricing offer alternative deposit products to its existing customers or seek to attract deposits from new customers in addition to the mitigating actions referenced above 

market risk 

overview 

market risk is the potential for losses arising from changes in the value of citi’s assets and liabilities resulting from changes in market variables such as interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices commodity prices and credit spreads as well as their implied volatilities 

each business is required to establish with approval from citi’s market risk management a market risk limit framework for identified risk factors that clearly defines approved risk profiles and is within the parameters of citi’s overall risk appetite these limits are monitored by the risk organization citi’s country and business asset and liability committees and the citigroup asset and liability committee in all cases the businesses are ultimately responsible for the market risks taken and for remaining within their defined limits 

market risk emanates from both citi’s trading and nontrading portfolios trading portfolios comprise all assets and liabilities markedtomarket with results reflected in earnings nontrading portfolios include all other assets and liabilities 

market risk of nontrading portfolios       

market risk from nontrading portfolios stems from the potential impact of changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates on citi’s net interest revenues the changes in accumulated   other comprehensive income loss  aoci from its investment portfolios and capital invested in foreign currencies 

net interest revenue at risk 

net interest revenue for interest rate exposure purposes is the difference between the yield earned on the nontrading portfolio assets including customer loans and the rate paid on the liabilities including customer deposits or company borrowings net interest revenue is affected by changes in the level of interest rates as well as the amounts of assets and liabilities and the timing of repricing of assets and liabilities to reflect market rates 

  citi’s principal measure of risk to net interest revenue is interest rate exposure ire ire measures the change in expected net interest revenue in each currency resulting solely from unanticipated changes in forward interest rates 

citi’s estimated ire incorporates various assumptions including prepayment rates on loans customer behavior and the impact of pricing decisions for example in rising interest rate scenarios portions of the deposit portfolio may be assumed to experience rate increases that are less than the change in market interest rates in declining interest rate scenarios it is assumed that mortgage portfolios experience higher prepayment rates ire assumes that businesses andor citi treasury make no additional changes in balances or positioning in response to the unanticipated rate changes 

in order to manage changes in interest rates effectively citi may modify pricing on new customer loans and deposits purchase fixed rate securities issue debt that is either fixed or floating or enter into derivative transactions that have the opposite risk exposures citi regularly assesses the viability of these and other strategies to reduce its interest rate risks and 

 

implements such strategies when it believes those actions are prudent 

citi manages interest rate risk as a consolidated companywide position citi’s clientfacing businesses create interestrate sensitive positions including loans and deposits as part of their ongoing activities citi treasury aggregates these risk positions and manages them centrally operating within established limits citi treasury makes positioning decisions and uses tools such as citi’s investment securities portfolio companyissued debt and interest rate derivatives to target the desired risk profile changes in citi’s interest rate risk position reflect the accumulated changes in all nontrading assets and liabilities with potentially large and offsetting impacts as well as citi treasury’s positioning decisions 

citigroup employs additional measurements including stress testing the impact of nonlinear interest rate movements on the value of the balance sheet the analysis of portfolio duration and volatility particularly as they relate to mortgage loans and mortgagebacked securities and the potential impact of the change in the spread between different market indices 

interest rate risk of investment portfolios—impact on aoci 

citi also measures the potential impacts of changes in interest rates on the value of its aoci which can in turn impact citi’s common equity tier 1 capital ratio citi’s goal is to benefit from an increase in the market level of interest rates while limiting the impact of changes in aoci on its regulatory capital position 

aoci at risk is managed as part of the companywide interest rate risk position aoci at risk considers potential changes in aoci and the corresponding impact on the common equity tier 1 capital ratio relative to citi’s capital generation capacity 

the following table sets forth the estimated impact to citi’s net interest revenue aoci and the common equity tier 1 capital ratio on a fully implemented basis each assuming an unanticipated parallel instantaneous 100 basis point increase in interest rates 



 the sequential decrease in the estimated impact to net interest revenue primarily reflected citi treasury actions offset by an increase in certain of citi’s deposit balances and an increasing capital base the sequential increase in the estimated impact to aoci and the common equity tier 1 capital ratio primarily reflected changes in the composition of citi treasury’s investment and interest rate derivatives portfolio 

in the event of an unanticipated parallel instantaneous 100 basis point increase in interest rates citi expects the negative impact to aoci would be offset in shareholders’ equity 

 

through the combination of expected incremental net interest revenue and the expected recovery of the impact on aoci through accretion of citi’s investment portfolio over a period of time as of december 31 2015  citi expects that the negative 48 billion impact to aoci in such a scenario could potentially be offset over approximately 22 months 

the following table sets forth the estimated impact to citi’s net interest revenue aoci and the common equity tier 1 capital ratio on a fully implemented basis under four different changes in interest rate scenarios for the us dollar and citi’s other currencies 



note each scenario in the table above assumes that the rate change will occur instantaneously changes in interest rates for maturities between the overnight rate and the 10year rate are interpolated 

 as shown in the table above the magnitude of the impact to citi’s net interest revenue and aoci is greater under scenario 2 as compared to scenario 3 this is because the combination of changes to citi’s investment portfolio partially offset by changes related to citi’s pension liabilities results in a net position that is more sensitive to rates at shorter and intermediate term maturities 

changes in foreign exchange rates—impacts on aoci and capital 

as of december 31 2015 citi estimates that an unanticipated parallel instantaneous 5 appreciation of the us dollar against all of the other currencies in which citi has invested capital could reduce citi’s tangible common equity tce by approximately 15 billion or 08 of tce as a result of changes to citi’s foreign currency translation adjustment in aoci net of hedges this impact would be primarily due to changes in the value of the mexican peso the euro the british pound sterling and the chinese yuan 

this impact is also before any mitigating actions citi may take including ongoing management of its foreign currency translation exposure specifically as currency movements change the value of citi’s net investments in foreigncurrencydenominated capital these movements also change the value of citi’s riskweighted assets denominated in those currencies this coupled with citi’s foreign currency hedging strategies such as foreign currency borrowings foreign currency forwards and other currency hedging instruments lessens the impact of foreign currency movements on citi’s common equity tier 1 capital ratio changes in these hedging strategies as well as hedging costs divestitures and tax impacts can further impact the actual impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on citi’s capital as compared to an unanticipated parallel shock as described above 

the effect of citi’s ongoing management strategies with respect to changes in foreign exchange rates and the impact of these changes on citi’s tce and common equity tier 1 capital ratio are shown in the table below for additional information in the changes in aoci see note 20  to the consolidated financial statements 

 



 

interest revenueexpense and net interest margin 



note all interest expense amounts include fdic deposit insurance assessments 

 

citi’s net interest margin nim is calculated by dividing gross interest revenue less gross interest expense by average interest earning assets citi’s nim was 292 in the fourth quarter of 2015 a slight decrease from 294 in the third quarter of 2015 and improved to 293 for the full year 2015 compared to 290 in 2014 the improvement in citi’s nim for the full year 2015 was driven by trading nim and the impact of lower cost of funds primarily declines in the cost of longterm debt partially offset by lower loan yields going into 2016 citi’s nim will reflect the sale of onemain financial which will be partially offset by the benefit of debt repurchases during 2015 including in the fourth quarter of 2015 accordingly citi currently expects a decrease in its nim in the first half of 2016 

as noted in the tables above citi’s interest expense includes the impact of fdic deposit insurance assessments 

 

as part of the doddfrank act the fdic is required to ensure that its deposit insurance fund reserve ratio reaches 135 by september 30 2020 in the fourth quarter of 2015 the fdic issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that would impose on insured depository institutions with at least 10 billion in assets large banks which includes citibank a surcharge of 45 basis points per annum until the fund reaches the required ratio which the fdic estimates would take approximately two years based on its current assessment base citi estimates the net impact to citibank would be approximately 500 million over the twoyear period as part of its proposed rulemaking the fdic also discussed an alternative to the surcharge proposal which would impose a onetime assessment similar to a shortfall assessment on large banks in order to reach the 135 target as discussed by the fdic this shortfall assessment would be approximately 12 basis points on the 

thencurrent assessment base in the quarter determined by the fdic if the fdic were to adopt this approach citi estimates the net impact to citibank would be approximately 900 million based on its current assessment base as an alternative to either of the proposals put forth by the fdic in commenting on the fdic’s notice of proposed rulemaking industry groups recommended that in lieu of any surcharge on 

 

large banks the fdic maintain the assessment rate framework in effect as of yearend 2015 until the reserve ratio reaches 135 which would be expected to occur by yearend 2019 and within the timeframe required under the doddfrank act i t is not certain when the fdic’s proposal will be finalized and what the ultimate impact will be to citi

market risk of trading portfolios 

trading portfolios include positions resulting from market making activities hedges of certain availableforsale afs debt securities the cva relating from derivatives counterparties and all associated hedges fair value option loans hedges to the loan portfolio and the leverage finance pipeline within capital markets origination within icg  

the market risk of citi’s trading portfolios is monitored using a combination of quantitative and qualitative measures including but not limited to 

 

each trading portfolio across citi’s businesses has its own market risk limit framework encompassing these measures and other controls including trading mandates 

 

permitted product lists and a new product approval process for complex products 

the following chart of total daily tradingrelated revenue loss captures trading volatility and shows the number of days in which revenues for citi’s trading businesses fell within particular ranges tradingrelated revenues includes trading net interest and other revenue associated with citi’s trading businesses it excludes dva fva and cva adjustments incurred due to changes in the credit quality of counterparties as well as any associated hedges to that cva in addition it excludes fees and other revenue associated with capital markets origination activities tradingrelated revenues are driven by both customer flows and the changes in valuation of the trading inventory as shown in the chart positive tradingrelated revenue was achieved for 97 of the trading days in 2015 



 

factor sensitivities 

factor sensitivities are expressed as the change in the value of a position for a defined change in a market risk factor such as a change in the value of a us treasury bill for a one basis point change in interest rates citi’s market risk management within the risk organization works to ensure that factor sensitivities are calculated monitored and in most cases limited for all material risks taken in the trading portfolios

var estimates at a 99 confidence level the potential decline in the value of a position or a portfolio under normal market conditions assuming a oneday holding period var statistics which are based on historical data can be materially different across firms due to differences in portfolio composition differences in var methodologies and differences in model parameters as a result citi believes var statistics can be used more effectively as indicators of trends in risktaking within a firm rather than as a basis for inferring differences in risktaking across firms 

citi uses a single independently approved monte carlo simulation var model see “var model review and validation” below which has been designed to capture material risk sensitivities such as first and secondorder sensitivities of positions to changes in market prices of 

 

various asset classesrisk types such as interest rate credit spread foreign exchange equity and commodity risks citi’s var includes positions which are measured at fair value it does not include investment securities classified as afs or htm for information on these securities see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements 

citi believes its var model is conservatively calibrated to incorporate fattail scaling and the greater of shortterm approximately the most recent month and longterm three years market volatility the monte carlo simulation involves approximately 300000 market factors making use of approximately 180000 time series with sensitivities updated daily volatility parameters updated daily to weekly and correlation parameters updated monthly the conservative features of the var calibration contribute an approximate 17 addon to what would be a var estimated under the assumption of stable and perfectly normally distributed markets 

as set forth in the table below citi’s average and yearend trading var decreased from 2014 to 2015 mainly due to changes in interest rate and credit spread exposures in the markets and securities services businesses within icg  trading and credit portfolio var also declined although the decrease from trading var was partially offset by additional hedging related to lending activities in 2015 



 2 the total trading var includes marktomarket and certain fair value option trading positions from icg and citi holdings with the exception of hedges to the loan portfolio fair value option loans and all cva exposures availableforsale and accrual exposures are not included 

 

  

the table below provides the range of market factor vars associated with citi’s total trading var inclusive of specific risk 



note no covariance adjustment can be inferred from the above table as the high and low for each market factor will be from different close of business dates 

the following table provides the var for icg  excluding the cva relating to derivative counterparties hedges of cva fair value option loans and hedges to the loan portfolio 



var model review and validation 

generally citi’s var review and model validation process entails reviewing the model framework major assumptions and implementation of the mathematical algorithm in addition as part of the model validation process product specific backtesting on portfolios is periodically completed and reviewed with citi’s us banking regulators furthermore regulatory var as described below backtesting is performed against buyandhold profit and loss on a monthly basis for multiple subportfolios across the organization trading desk level icg  business segment and citigroup and the results are shared with the us banking regulators 

significant var model and assumption changes must be independently validated within citi’s risk management organization this validation process includes a review by citi’s model validation group and further approval from its model validation review committee which is composed of senior quantitative risk management officers in the event of significant model changes parallel model runs are undertaken prior to implementation in addition significant model and assumption changes are subject to the periodic reviews and approval by citi’s us banking regulators 

citi uses the same independently validated var model for both regulatory var and risk management var ie total trading and total trading and credit portfolios vars and as such the model review and oversight process for both purposes is as described above 

regulatory var which is calculated in accordance with basel iii differs from risk management var due to the fact 

 

that certain positions included in risk management var are not eligible for market risk treatment in regulatory var the composition of risk management var is discussed under “value at risk” above the applicability of the var model for positions eligible for market risk treatment under us regulatory capital rules is periodically reviewed and approved by citi’s us banking regulators 

in accordance with basel iii regulatory var includes all trading book covered positions and all foreign exchange and commodity exposures pursuant to basel iii regulatory var excludes positions that fail to meet the intent and ability to trade requirements and are therefore classified as nontrading book and categories of exposures that are specifically excluded as covered positions regulatory var excludes cva on derivative instruments and dva on citi’s own fair value option liabilities cva hedges are excluded from regulatory var and included in credit riskweighted assets as computed under the advanced approaches for determining riskweighted assets 

regulatory var backtesting 

in accordance with basel iii citi is required to perform backtesting to evaluate the effectiveness of its regulatory var model regulatory var backtesting is the process in which the daily oneday var at a 99 confidence interval is compared to the buyandhold profit and loss ie the profit and loss impact if the portfolio is held constant at the end of the day and repriced the following day buyandhold profit and loss represents the daily marktomarket profit and loss attributable to price movements in covered positions from the close of the previous business day buyandhold profit and loss excludes realized trading revenue net interest fees and commissions intraday trading profit and loss and changes in reserves 

based on a 99 confidence level citi would expect two to three days in any one year where buyandhold losses exceeded the regulatory var given the conservative calibration of citi’s var model as a result of taking the greater of short and longterm volatilities and fattail scaling of volatilities citi would expect fewer exceptions under normal and stable market conditions periods of unstable market conditions could increase the number of backtesting exceptions 

the following graph shows the daily buyandhold profit and loss associated with citi’s covered positions compared to citi’s oneday regulatory var during 2015 as of december 31 2015 there was one backtesting exception observed for citi’s regulatory var for the prior 12 months as previously disclosed trading losses on january 15 2015 exceeded the var estimate at the citigroup level following the swiss national bank’s announcement removing the minimum exchange rate of swiss franc per euro 

 

the difference between the   38   of days with buyandhold gains for regulatory var backtesting and the 97 of days with trading net interest and other revenue associated with citi’s trading businesses shown in the histogram of daily tradingrelated revenue above reflects among other things that a significant portion of citi’s tradingrelated revenue is not generated from daily price movements on these positions and exposures as well as differences in the portfolio composition of regulatory var and risk management var 



 

stress testing 

citi performs stress testing on a regular basis to estimate the impact of extreme market movements it is performed on individual positions and trading portfolios as well as in aggregate inclusive of multiple trading portfolios citi’s market risk management after consultations with the businesses develops both systemic and specific stress scenarios reviews the output of periodic stress testing exercises and uses the information to assess the ongoing appropriateness of exposure levels and limits citi uses two complementary approaches to market risk stress testing across all major risk factors ie equity foreign exchange commodity interest rate and credit spreads topdown systemic stresses and bottomup business specific stresses systemic stresses are designed to quantify the potential impact of extreme market movements on an institutionwide basis and are constructed using both historical periods of market stress and projections of adverse economic scenarios business specific stresses are designed to probe the risks of particular portfolios and market segments 

especially those risks that are not fully captured in var and systemic stresses 

the systemic stress scenarios and business specific stress scenarios at citi are used in several reports reviewed by senior management and also to calculate internal risk capital for trading market risk in general changes in market factors are defined over a oneyear horizon however for the purpose of calculating internal risk capital changes in a very limited number of the most liquid market factors are defined over a shorter threemonth horizon the limited set of market factors subject to the shorter threemonth time horizon are those that in management’s judgment have historically remained very liquid during financial crises even as the trading liquidity of most other market factors materially decreased 

operational risk 

operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes systems or human factors or from external events it includes the reputation and franchise risk associated with business practices or market conduct in which citi is involved operational risk is inherent in citi’s global business activities as well as the internal processes that support those business activities and can result in losses arising from events related to the following among others 

 

citi manages operational risk consistent with the overall framework described in “managing global risk—overview” above the goal is to keep operational risk at appropriate levels relative to the characteristics of citi’s businesses the markets in which it operates its capital and liquidity and the competitive economic and regulatory environment 

to anticipate mitigate and control operational risk citi maintains a system of policies and has established a consistent framework for monitoring assessing and communicating operational risks and the overall operating effectiveness of the internal control environment across citigroup as part of this framework citi has established a manager’s control assessment process as described under “compliance conduct and legal risk—compliance risk” below to help managers selfassess significant operational risks and key controls and identify and address weaknesses in the design andor operating effectiveness of internal controls that mitigate significant operational risks 

each major business segment must implement an operational risk process consistent with the requirements of this framework the process for operational risk management includes the following steps 

 

as new products and business activities are developed processes are designed modified or sourced through alternative means and operational risks are considered 

an operational risk management committee has been established to provide oversight for operational risk across citigroup and to provide a forum to assess citi’s operational risk profile and ensure actions are taken so that citi’s operational risk exposure is actively managed consistent with citi’s risk appetite the committee seeks to ensure that these actions address the root causes that persistently lead to 

 

operational risk losses and create lasting solutions to minimize these losses members include citi’s chief risk officer and citi’s head of operational risk and senior members of their organizations these members cover multiple dimensions of risk management and include business and regional chief risk officers and senior operational risk managers 

in addition risk management including operational risk management works proactively with the businesses and other independent control functions to embed a strong operational risk management culture and framework across citi operational risk management engages with the businesses and the respective chief risk officers to ensure effective implementation of the operational risk management framework by focusing on i identification analysis and assessment of operational risks ii effective challenge of key control issues and operational risks and iii anticipation and mitigation of operational risk events 

information about the businesses’ operational risk historical operational risk losses and the control environment is reported by each major business segment and functional area the information is summarized and reported to senior management as well as to the audit committee of citi’s board of directors 

operational risk is measured and assessed through risk capital projected operational risk losses under stress scenarios are also required as part of the federal reserve board’s ccar process 

country risk 

emerging markets exposures 

citi generally defines emerging markets as countries in latin america  asia  other than japan australia and new zealand central and eastern europe the middle east and africa 

the following table presents citicorp’s principal emerging markets assets as of december 31 2015 for 

purposes of the table below loan amounts are generally based on the domicile of the borrower for example a loan to a 

 

chinese subsidiary of a switzerlandbased corporation will generally be categorized as a loan in china trading account assets and investment securities are generally categorized below based on the domicile of the issuer of the security or the underlying reference entity for additional information on the assets included in the table see the footnotes to the table below 

  



note aggregate may not crossfoot due to rounding prior periods have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation 

 

emerging markets trading account assets and investment securities 

in the ordinary course of business citi holds securities in its trading accounts and investment accounts including those above trading account assets are marked to market daily with asset levels varying as citi maintains inventory consistent with customer needs investment securities are recorded at either fair value or historical cost based on the underlying accounting treatment and are predominantly held as part of the local entity asset and liability management program or to comply with local regulatory requirements in the markets in the table above approximately 99 of citi’s investment securities were related to sovereign issuers as of december 31 2015 

emerging markets consumer lending 

gcb ’s strategy within the emerging markets is consistent with gcb ’s overall strategy which is to leverage its global footprint to serve its target clients the retail bank seeks to be the preeminent bank for the emerging affluent and affluent consumers in large urban centers in credit cards and in certain retail markets citi serves customers in a somewhat broader set of segments and geographies commercial banking generally serves small and middlemarket enterprises operating in gcb ’s geographic markets focused on clients that value citi’s global capabilities overall citi believes that its customers are more resilient than the overall market under a wide range of economic conditions citi’s consumer business has a wellestablished risk appetite framework across geographies and products that reflects the business strategy and activities and establishes boundaries around the key risks that arise from the strategy and activities 

as of december 31 2015 gcb  had approximately 110 billion of consumer loans outstanding to borrowers in the emerging markets or approximately 38 of gcb ’s total loans largely unchanged from september 30 2015 and compared to 118 billion 41 as of december 31 2014 of the approximate 110 billion as of december 31 2015 the five largest emerging markets—mexico korea singapore hong kong and taiwan—comprised approximately 27 of gcb ’s total loans within the emerging markets 30 of citi’s gcb  loans were mortgages 26 were commercial markets loans 24 were personal loans and 20 were credit card loans each as of december 31 2015 

overall consumer credit quality remained generally stable in the fourth quarter of 2015 as net credit losses in the emerging markets were 19 of average loans compared to 18 and 22 in the third quarter of 2015 and fourth quarter of 2014 respectively consistent with citi’s target market strategy and risk appetite framework the increase in net credit losses in certain emerging market countries in asia  such as hong kong and indonesia primarily related to citi’s commercial banking business in such countries and was primarily due to the impact of lower commodity prices as well as the slowdown in growth in the region the increase in net credit losses in brazil also related to the commercial banking business and largely related to a winddown portfolio in brazil where the losses were mostly offset by the release of previouslyestablished loan loss reserves 

 

emerging markets corporate lending 

consistent with  icg ’s overall strategy citi’s corporate clients in the emerging markets are typically large multinational corporations that value citi’s global network citi aims to establish relationships with these clients that encompass multiple products consistent with client needs including cash management and trade services foreign exchange lending capital markets and ma advisory citi believes that its target corporate segment is more resilient under a wide range of economic conditions and that its relationshipbased approach to client service enables it to effectively manage the risks inherent in such relationships citi has a wellestablished risk appetite framework around its corporate lending activities including riskbased limits and approval authorities and portfolio concentration boundaries 

as of december 31 2015 corporate loans excluding the private bank were approximately 93 billion in the emerging markets representing approximately 43 of total corporate loans outstanding compared to 97 billion 43 and 99 billion 47 as of september 30 2015 and december 31 2014 respectively no single emerging markets country accounted for more than 6 of citi’s corporate loans as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2015 

as of december 31 2015 approximately 75 of citi’s emerging markets corporate credit portfolio excluding the private bank including loans and unfunded lending commitments was rated investment grade which citi considers to be ratings of bbb or better according to its internal risk measurement system and methodology for additional information on citi’s internal risk measurement system for corporate credit see “corporate credit” above the majority of the remainder was rated bb or b according to citi’s internal risk measurement system and methodology 

the private bank which is part of icg  and primarily serves highnetworth individuals had approximately 17 billion of loans in the emerging markets as of december 31 2015 representing approximately 25 of the business’s total loans outstanding unchanged from september 30 2015 and compared to 17 billion 27 as of december 31 2014 private bank loans are typically secured by liquid collateral or real estate and consistent with the rest of the icg  loan portfolio the business has a wellestablished risk appetite framework around its lending activities including riskbased limits and approval authorities and portfolio concentration boundaries 

overall icg  net credit losses in the emerging markets were 01 of average loans in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to 00 and 04 in the third quarter of 2015 and fourth quarter of 2014 respectively the ratio of nonaccrual  icg  loans to total loans in the emerging markets remained stable at 04 as of december 31 2015 

argentina   

as of december 31 2015 citi’s net investment in its argentine operations was approximately 747 million compared to 917 million at september 30 2015 and 780 million at december 31 2014 

citi uses the argentine peso as the functional currency in argentina and translates its financial statements into us dollars using the official exchange rate as published by the central bank of argentina over the last several years the argentine government has imposed strict foreign exchange controls which have limited citi’s ability to access us dollars and other foreign currencies repatriate capital and hedge its currency risk among other impacts in the latter part of 2015 however argentina elected a new president and the argentine government took steps to loosen some of these foreign exchange controls while these actions were encouraging they did result in a devaluation of the argentine peso to 13 pesos per one us dollar at december 31 2015 compared to 94 pesos per one us dollar at september 30 2015 and 86 pesos per one us dollar at december 31 2014 

the impact of devaluations of the argentine peso on citi’s net investment in argentina is reported as a translation loss in stockholders’ equity offset to the extent hedged by 

 

at december 31 2015 citi had cumulative translation losses related to its investment in argentina net of qualifying net investment hedges of approximately 188 billion pretax which were recorded in stockholders’ equity this compared to 166 billion pretax as of september 30 2015 and 151 billion pretax as of december 31 2014 the cumulative translation losses would not be reclassified into earnings unless realized upon sale or liquidation of substantially all of citi’s argentine operations 

as noted above citi hedges currency risk in its net investment in argentina to the extent possible and prudent as of december 31 2015 citi’s total hedges against its net investment in argentina were approximately 821 million compared to 972 million as of september 30 2015 and 810 million as of december 31 2014 of this amount approximately 567 million consisted of foreign currency forwards that were recorded as net investment hedges under asc 815 compared to approximately 562 million as of september 30 2015 and 420 million as of december 31 2014 the remaining hedges of approximately 254 million as of december 31 2015 compared to 410 million as of september 30 2015 and 390 million as of december 31 2014 were net us dollardenominated assets and foreign currency futures in citi argentina that do not qualify for hedge accounting under asc 815 

 

although citi currently uses the argentine peso as the functional currency for its operations in argentina an increase in inflation resulting in a cumulative threeyear inflation rate of 100 or more would result in a change in the functional currency to the us dollar citi bases its evaluation of the cumulative threeyear inflation rate on the official inflation statistics published by indec the argentine government’s statistics agency the cumulative threeyear inflation rate as of november 30 2015 based on statistics published by indec was approximately 57 compared to 52 as of december 31 2014 while a change in the functional currency to the us dollar would not result in any immediate gains or losses to citi it would result in future devaluations of the argentine peso being recorded in earnings for citi’s argentine pesodenominated assets and liabilities 

as of december 31 2015 citi had total thirdparty assets of approximately 44 billion in citi argentina unchanged from september 30 2015 and compared to 41 billion at december 31 2014 primarily composed of corporate and consumer loans and cash on deposit with and shortterm paper issued by the central bank of argentina a significant portion of these assets was funded with local deposits included in the total assets were us dollardenominated assets of approximately 918 million compared to approximately 562 million at september 30 2015 and 550 million at december 31 2014 the sequential increase in us dollardenominated assets was largely due to the argentine government’s loosening of foreign exchange controls toward the end of 2015 as referenced above for additional information on citi’s exposures related to argentina see “emerging markets exposures” above 

in addition to these foreign exchange and other economic risks as widely reported argentina continues to be engaged in litigation in the us with certain “holdout” bond investors who did not accept restructured bonds in the restructuring of argentine debt after argentina defaulted on its sovereign obligations in 2001 based on us court rulings to date argentina has been ordered to negotiate a settlement with “holdout” bond investors and absent a negotiated settlement not pay interest on certain of its restructured bonds unless it simultaneously pays all amounts owed to the “holdout” investors that are the subject of the litigation although argentina has been in technical default of the us court’s ruling since mid2014 argentina’s new president has announced that it will be a priority for his administration to attempt to settle the dispute and in february 2016 argentina restarted negotiations with its creditors including the “holdout” investors 

citi argentina acted as a custodian in argentina for certain of the restructured bonds that are part of the “holdout” bond litigation specifically usdollardenominated restructured bonds governed by argentine law and payable in argentina in 2015 the us court overseeing the argentina litigation ruled that citi argentina’s processing of interest payments on these bonds as custodian was prohibited by the court’s order as a result citi 

announced its intention to exit its custody business in 

argentina which such exit is not expected to have a material impact on citi argentina’s results of operations upon such announcement the prior argentine government took a number of adverse actions against citi argentina including filing a lawsuit against citi argentina and suspending certain of its activities while the new government has to date indicated a willingness to settle these matters it remains uncertain as to when these matters will be resolved and what impact if any such resolution will have on citi or its franchise in argentina 

venezuela 

the venezuelan government operates restrictive foreign exchange controls these exchange controls have limited citi’s ability to obtain us dollars in venezuela citi has not been able to acquire us dollars from the venezuelan government since 2008 other than for its customers’ needs 

as of december 31 2015 the venezuelan government operated three separate official foreign exchange rates  

 

citi uses the us dollar as the functional currency for its operations in venezuela as of december 31 2015 citi uses the sicad rate to remeasure its net bolivardenominated monetary assets as the sicad rate is the only rate at which citi is legally eligible to acquire us dollars from cencoex despite the limited availability of us dollars and although the sicad rate may not necessarily be reflective of economic reality remeasurement of citi’s bolivardenominated assets and liabilities due to changes in the exchange rate is recorded in earnings citi has been unable to hedge the currency risk in its net investment in venezuela due to the lack of effective market hedging mechanisms 

at december 31 2015 citi’s net investment in its venezuelan operations was approximately 200 million compared to 187 million at september 30 2015 and 180 million at december 31 2014 which included net monetary assets denominated in venezuelan bolivars of approximately 177 million compared to approximately 160 million at september 30 2015 and 140 million at december 31 2014 total thirdparty assets of citi venezuela were approximately 10 billion at december 31 2015 unchanged from september 30 2015 and compared to 09 billion at december 31 2014 primarily composed of cash on deposit with the central bank of venezuela corporate and consumer loans and government bonds a significant portion of these assets was funded with local deposits 

on february 17 2016 the venezuelan government announced changes to its foreign exchange controls based on the announcement the cencoex rate would increase to 10 bolivars per us dollar the sicad rate would no longer 

 

exist and the simadi rate is expected to become a free floating rate of at least 202 bolivars per us dollar at inception 

based on this announcement citi expects to begin using the simadi rate in the first quarter of 2016 to remeasure its net bolivardenominated monetary assets despite the possibly limited availability of us dollars notwithstanding the fact that it has been described as a free floating rate and although the new simadi rate may not necessarily be reflective of economic reality at the expected minimum new simadi rate of 202 bolivars per us dollar citi estimates that it will incur an approximate 172 million foreign currency loss in the first quarter of 2016 which could increase if the bolivar continues to devalue in the new simadi market additionally citi expects its revenues and expenses will be translated at the simadi rate beginning in the first quarter of 2016 because the new foreign exchange control rules have not yet been officially published and are thus not yet effective however the impact to citi’s results of operations as a result of the february 17th announcement is not yet certain 

russia 

during 2015 political events led to the imposition of international sanctions against russia as well as russian entities business sectors individuals or otherwise these ongoing sanctions coupled with lower oil and other commodity prices particularly during the second half of 2015 have had a significant impact on russia’s economy and could continue to do so during 2015 the russian ruble depreciated by 22 against the us dollar 

citibank operates in russia through a subsidiary which uses the russian ruble as its functional currency citibank’s net investment in russia was approximately 08 billion at december 31 2015 compared to 09 billion at september 30 2015 and 11 billion at december 31 2014 as of december 31 2015 substantially all of citibank’s net investment was hedged subject to related tax adjustments using forward foreign exchange contracts total thirdparty assets of the russian citibank subsidiary were approximately 50 billion as of december 31 2015 unchanged from september 30 2015 and compared to 61 billion at december 31 2014 these assets were primarily composed of corporate and consumer loans russian government debt securities and cash on deposit with the central bank of russia the large majority of these assets were funded by local deposits for additional information on citi’s exposures related to russia see “emerging markets exposures” above 

ffiec—crossborder claims on third parties and local country assets 

citi’s crossborder disclosures are based on the country exposure bank regulatory reporting guidelines of the federal financial institutions examination council ffiec as revised in december 2013 the following summarizes some of the ffiec key reporting guidelines 

 

given the requirements noted above citi’s ffiec crossborder exposures and total outstandings tend to fluctuate in some cases significantly from period to period as an example because total outstandings under ffiec guidelines do not include the benefit of margin or hedges market volatility in interest rates foreign exchange rates and credit spreads may cause significant fluctuations in the level of total outstandings all else being equal 

the tables below set forth each country whose total outstandings exceeded 075 of total citigroup assets

compliance conduct and legal risk 

compliance risk 

compliance risk appetite framework 

citi’s compliance risk appetite framework outlines citi’s compliance risk appetite how citi manages its adherence to its compliance risk appetite and how citi evaluates the effectiveness of its controls for managing compliance risks this framework is comprised of three pillars 

 

compliance program 

compliance aims to operate citi’s compliance risk appetite— and thus minimize mitigate or manage compliance risks— through citi’s compliance program to achieve this mission compliance seeks to 



 

facilitate the identification and assessment of compliance risk compliance works with the businesses and other independent control functions to review significant compliance and regulatory issues and the results of testing monitoring and internal and external exams and audits 



compliance plays a key role in developing companywide initiatives designed to further embed ethics in citi’s culture such as an interactive course on ethics and leadership for employees which included training on using an ethical decisionmaking framework to challenge decisions by citi’s businesses 

 

volcker compliance program 

the volcker rule required citi to develop and provide for an enhanced compliance program reasonably designed to ensure and monitor compliance with the rule’s prohibitions and restrictions on proprietary trading and covered fund activities and investments citi’s volcker rule office which reports to business management has responsibility for overall coordination and monitoring under its compliance program including project management and process support and providing assistance in coordinating engagement with and among citi’s second line of defense for additional information see “risk factors—regulatory risks” and “—compliance conduct and legal risks” above 

conduct risk 

citi manages its exposure to conduct risk through the three lines of defense as discussed above each employee in each line of defense is guided by citi’s mission and value proposition and the principle of responsible finance citi’s leadership standards which are aligned with citi’s mission and value proposition outline citi’s expectations of employees’ behavior and employees’ performance is evaluated against those standards citi’s businesses and functions are responsible for managing their conduct risks compliance advises citi’s businesses and other functions on conduct risks and associated controls internal audit among other things assesses the adequacy and effectiveness of citi’s management of and controls for conduct risk 

in 2015 citi issued a conduct risk policy to further the objectives of its complianceled conduct risk program which was established in 2014 to enhance citi’s culture of compliance and control through the management minimization and mitigation of citi’s exposure to conduct risk citi uses the mca process to assess the design and operation of controls that are utilized to manage the institution’s conduct risks citi also manages its conduct risk through other initiatives including various culturerelated efforts 

legal risk 

citi views legal risk as qualitative in nature because it cannot be reliably estimated or measured based on forecasts rather than actual results using statistical methods and does not lend itself to an appetite expressed through a numerical limit as such citi seeks to manage this risk in accordance with its qualitative risk appetite principle which generally state that activities in which citi engages and the risks those activities generate must be consistent with citi’s underlying 

 

commitment to the principle of responsible finance and managed with a goal to eliminate minimize or mitigate this risk as practicable to accomplish this goal legal risk is managed in accordance with the overall framework described in greater detail in “managing global risk—overview” above 

reputational risk 

citi’s reputation is a vital asset in building trust with its stakeholders and citi is diligent in communicating its corporate values including the importance of protecting citi’s reputation to its employees customers and investors the responsibility for maintaining citi’s reputation is shared by all employees who are guided by citi’s code of conduct employees are required to exercise sound judgment and common sense in every action they take and issues that present potential franchise reputational andor systemic risks are to be appropriately escalated the business practices committees for each of citi’s businesses and regions are part of the governance infrastructure citi has in place to properly review business activities sales practices product design perceived conflicts of interest and other potential franchise or reputational risks that arise in these businesses and regions these committees may also raise potential franchise reputational or systemic risks for due consideration by the business practices committee at the corporate level all of these committees which are composed of citi’s most senior executives provide the guidance necessary for citi’s business practices to meet the highest standards of professionalism integrity and ethical behavior consistent with citi’s mission and value proposition 

significant accounting policies and significant estimates 

note 1 to the consolidated financial statements contains a summary of citigroup’s significant accounting policies including a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements these policies as well as estimates made by management are integral to the presentation of citi’s results of operations and financial condition while all of these policies require a certain level of management judgment and estimates this section highlights and discusses the significant accounting policies that require management to make highly difficult complex or subjective judgments and estimates at times regarding matters that are inherently uncertain and susceptible to change see also “risk factors—operational risks” above management has discussed each of these significant accounting policies the related estimates and its judgments with the audit committee of the citigroup board of directors 

valuations of financial instruments 

citigroup holds debt and equity securities derivatives retained interests in securitizations investments in private equity and other financial instruments substantially all of 

these assets and liabilities are reflected at fair value on citi’s 

consolidated balance sheet 

citi purchases securities under agreements to 

resell reverse repos and sells securities under agreements 

to repurchase repos a majority of which are carried at 

fair value in addition certain loans shortterm borrowings 

longterm debt and deposits as well as certain securities 

borrowed and loaned positions that are collateralized with 

cash are carried at fair value citigroup holds its investments 

trading assets and liabilities and resale and repurchase 

agreements on the consolidated balance sheet to meet 

customer needs and to manage liquidity needs interest rate risks and private equity investing 

when available citi generally uses quoted market prices to determine fair value and classifies such items within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy established under asc 82010  fair value measurement  if quoted market prices are not available fair value is based upon internally developed valuation models that use where possible current marketbased or independently sourced market parameters such as interest rates currency rates and option volatilities such models are often based on a discounted cash flow analysis in addition items valued using such internally generated valuation techniques are classified according to the lowest level input or value driver that is significant to the valuation thus an item may be classified under the fair value hierarchy as level 3 even though there may be some significant inputs that are readily observable 

the credit crisis caused some markets to become illiquid thus reducing the availability of certain observable data used by citi’s valuation techniques this illiquidity in certain markets continued through 2015 when or if liquidity returns to these markets the valuations will revert to using the related observable inputs in verifying internally calculated values 

citi is required to exercise subjective judgments relating to the applicability and functionality of internal valuation 

 

models the significance of inputs or value drivers to the valuation of an instrument and the degree of illiquidity and subsequent lack of observability in certain markets these judgments have the potential to impact the company’s financial performance for instruments where the changes in fair value are recognized in either the consolidated statement of income or in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  aoci 

moreover for certain investments decreases in fair value are only recognized in earnings in the consolidated statement of income if such decreases are judged to be an otherthantemporary impairment otti adjudicating the temporary nature of fair value impairments is also inherently judgmental 

 the fair value of financial instruments incorporates the effects of citi’s own credit risk and the market view of counterparty credit risk the quantification of which is also complex and judgmental for additional information on citi’s fair value analysis see notes 1 6 25 and 26 to the consolidated financial statements 

allowance for credit losses 

management provides reserves for an estimate of probable losses inherent in the funded loan portfolio and in unfunded loan commitments and standby letters of credit on the consolidated balance sheet in the allowance for loan losses  and in  other liabilities  respectively 

estimates of these probable losses are based upon i citigroup’s internal system of creditrisk ratings which are analogous to the risk ratings of the major credit rating agencies and ii historical default and loss data including rating agency information regarding default rates from 1983 to 2014 and internal data dating to the early 1970s on severity of losses in the event of default adjustments may be made to this data including i statistically calculated estimates to cover the historical fluctuation of the default rates over the credit cycle the historical variability of loss severity among defaulted loans and the degree to which there are large obligor concentrations in the global portfolio and ii adjustments made for specifically known items such as current environmental factors and credit trends 

in addition representatives from both the risk management and finance staffs who cover business areas with delinquencymanaged portfolios containing smaller balance homogeneous loans present their recommended reserve balances based upon leading credit indicators including loan delinquencies and changes in portfolio size as well as economic trends including housing prices unemployment and gdp this methodology is applied separately for each individual product within each geographic region in which these portfolios exist 

this evaluation process is subject to numerous estimates and judgments the frequency of default risk ratings loss recovery rates the size and diversity of individual large credits and the ability of borrowers with foreign currency obligations to obtain the foreign currency necessary for orderly debt servicing among other things are all taken into account during this review changes in these estimates could 

have a direct impact on citi’s credit costs and the allowance in any period

goodwill 

citi tests goodwill for impairment annually on july 1 the annual test and between annual tests the interim test if an event occurs or circumstances change that would morelikelythannot reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount such as a significant adverse change in the business climate a decision to sell or dispose of all or a significant portion of a reporting unit or a significant decline in citi’s stock price during 2015 interim tests were performed which resulted in 31 million of total goodwill impairment recorded in operating expenses  as a result of reorganization and disposal of a significant portion of a reporting unit described in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements 

as of december 31 2015 citigroup consists of the following business segments global consumer banking  institutional clients group corporateother  and citi holdings goodwill impairment testing is performed at the level below the business segment referred to as a reporting unit goodwill is allocated to citi’s 11 reporting units at the date the goodwill is recorded once goodwill has been allocated to the reporting units it generally no longer retains its identification with a particular acquisition but instead becomes identified with the reporting unit as a whole as a result all of the fair value of each reporting unit is available to support the allocated goodwill 

the carrying value used in the impairment test for the 11 reporting units and corporateother  together the “components” is generally derived by allocating citigroup’s total stockholders’ equity to each component as follows first citigroup’s total tangible common equity tce is allocated to each component based on its basel iii riskweighted assets and adding back any specifically identified basel iii capital deductions for each component second once total citigroup’s tce is allocated to each component the reported goodwill and intangibles associated with each reporting unit are added to their respective carrying amounts lastly any remaining stockholders’ equity is allocated to each component based on its relative allocated tce thus the combined equity allocated to each component is equal to citigroup’s total stockholders’ equity 

goodwill impairment testing involves management judgment requiring an assessment of whether the carrying value of the reporting unit can be supported by the fair value of the individual reporting unit using widely accepted valuation techniques such as the market approach earnings multiples andor transaction multiples andor the income approach discounted cash flow dcf method in applying these methodologies citi utilizes a number of factors including actual operating results future business plans economic projections and market data citi prepares a formal threeyear plan for its businesses on an annual basis these projections incorporate certain external economic projections 

 

developed at the point in time the plan is developed for the purpose of performing any impairment test the most recent threeyear forecast available is updated by citi to reflect current economic conditions as of the testing date citi uses the updated longrange financial forecasts as a basis for its annual goodwill impairment test management may engage an independent valuation specialist to assist in citi’s valuation process 

similar to the prior year citigroup engaged an independent valuation specialist in 2015 to assist in citi’s valuation for most of the reporting units employing both the market approach and dcf method citi believes that the dcf method using management projections for the selected reporting units and an appropriate riskadjusted discount rate is most reflective of a market participant’s view of fair values given current market conditions for reporting units where both methods were utilized in 2015 the resulting fair values were relatively consistent and appropriate weighting was given to outputs from both methods 

the dcf method used at the time of each impairment test used discount rates that citi believes adequately reflected the risk and uncertainty in the financial markets in the internally generated cash flow projections the dcf method employs a capital asset pricing model in estimating the discount rate citi continues to value the remaining reporting units where it believes the risk of impairment to be low using primarily the market approach 

since none of the company’s reporting units are publicly traded individual reporting unit fairvalue determinations cannot be directly correlated to citigroup’s common stock price the sum of the fair values of the reporting units at july 1 2015 exceeded the overall market capitalization of citi as of july 1 2015 however citi believes that it is not meaningful to reconcile the sum of the fair values of the company’s reporting units to its market capitalization due to several factors the market capitalization of citigroup reflects the execution risk in a transaction involving citigroup due to its size however the individual reporting units’ fair values are not subject to the same level of execution risk or a business model that is perceived to be as complex 

        see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on goodwill including the changes in the goodwill balance yearoveryear and the reporting unit goodwill balances as of december 31 2015 

income taxes 

overview 

citi is subject to the income tax laws of the us its states and local municipalities and the foreign jurisdictions in which citi operates these tax laws are complex and are subject to differing interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be subject to review and adjudication by the court systems of the various tax jurisdictions or may be settled with the taxing authority upon audit 

in establishing a provision for income tax expense citi must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws citi must also make 

estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions both domestic and foreign deferred taxes are recorded for the future consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns based upon enacted tax laws and rates deferred tax assets dtas are recognized subject to management’s judgment that realization is morelikelythannot 

dtas 

at december 31 2015 citi had recorded net dtas of 478 billion in the fourth quarter of 2015 citi’s dtas increased 600 million driven by movements in aoci partially offset by earnings on a fullyear basis citi’s dtas decreased 15 billion from 493 billion at december 31 2014 the decrease in total dtas yearoveryear was primarily due to the earnings in citicorp and citi holdings partially offset by an increase in aoci 

foreign tax credits ftcs comprised approximately 159 billion of citi’s dtas as of december 31 2015 compared to approximately 176 billion as of december 31 2014 the decrease in ftcs yearoveryear was due to the generation of us taxable income and represented 17 billion of the 15 billion decrease in citi’s overall dtas noted above partially offset by the increase in the aocirelated dtas the ftcs carryforward periods represent the most timesensitive component of citi’s dtas accordingly in 2016 citi will continue to prioritize reducing the ftc carryforward component of the dtas secondarily citi’s actions will focus on reducing other dta components and thereby reduce the total dtas citi’s dtas will decline primarily as additional domestic gaap taxable income is generated 

while citi’s net total dtas decreased yearoveryear the time remaining for utilization has shortened given the passage of time particularly with respect to the ftcs component of the dtas although realization is not assured citi believes that the realization of the recognized net dtas of 478 billion at december 31 2015 is morelikelythannot based upon management’s expectations as to future taxable income in the jurisdictions in which the dtas arise as well as available tax planning strategies as defined in asc 740 income taxes  that would be implemented if necessary to prevent a carryforward from expiring 

citi has concluded that it has the necessary positive evidence to support the full realization of its dtas specifically citi forecasts sufficient us taxable income in the carryforward periods exclusive of asc 740 tax planning strategies citi’s forecasted taxable income which will continue to be subject to overall market and global economic conditions incorporates geographic business forecasts and taxable income adjustments to those forecasts eg us tax exempt income loan loss reserves deductible for us tax reporting in subsequent years and actions intended to optimize its us taxable earnings in general citi would need to generate approximately 59 billion of us taxable income during the ftcs carryforward periods to prevent citi’s ftcs from expiring 

in addition to its forecasted us taxable income citi has tax planning strategies available to it under asc 740 that 

 

would be implemented if necessary to prevent a carryforward from expiring these strategies include i repatriating lowtaxed foreign source earnings for which an assertion that the earnings have been indefinitely reinvested has not been made ii accelerating us taxable income into or deferring us tax deductions out of the latter years of the carryforward period eg selling appreciated assets electing straightline depreciation iii accelerating deductible temporary differences outside the us and iv selling certain assets that produce taxexempt income while purchasing assets that produce fully taxable income in addition the sale or restructuring of certain businesses can produce significant us taxable income within the relevant carryforward periods 

based upon the foregoing discussion citi believes the us federal and new york state and city net operating loss carryforward period of 20 years provides enough time to fully utilize the dtas pertaining to the existing net operating loss carryforwards and any net operating loss that would be created by the reversal of the future net deductions that have not yet been taken on a tax return 

with respect to the ftcs component of the dtas the carryforward period is 10 years citi believes that it will generate sufficient us taxable income within the 10year carryforward period to be able to fully utilize the ftcs in addition to any ftcs produced in such period which must be used prior to any carryforward utilization 

for additional information on citi’s income taxes including its income tax provision tax assets and liabilities and a tabular summary of citi’s net dtas balance as of december 31 2015 including the ftcs and applicable expiration dates of the ftcs see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements

disclosure controls and procedures 

citi’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms including without limitation that information required to be disclosed by citi in its sec filings is accumulated and communicated to management including the chief executive officer ceo and chief financial officer cfo as appropriate to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure

management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting 

citi’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting citi’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles citi’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of citi’s assets ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that citi’s receipts and expenditures are made only in accordance with authorizations of citi’s management and directors and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of citi’s assets that could have a material effect on its financial statements 

 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate in addition given citi’s large size complex operations and global footprint lapses or deficiencies in internal controls may occur from time to time 

citi management assessed the effectiveness of citigroup’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2015 based on the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in  internal controlintegrated framework 2013  based on this assessment management believes that as of december 31 2015 citi’s internal control over financial reporting was effective in addition there were no changes in citi’s internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended december 31 2015 that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect citi’s internal control over financial reporting

certain reclassifications have been made to the prior periods’ financial statements and notes to conform to the current period’s presentation 

principles of consolidation 

the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of citigroup and its subsidiaries prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap the company consolidates subsidiaries in which it holds directly or indirectly more than 50 of the voting rights or where it exercises control entities where the company holds 20 to 50 of the voting rights andor has the ability to exercise significant influence other than investments of designated venture capital subsidiaries or investments accounted for at fair value under the fair value option are accounted for under the equity method and the pro rata share of their income loss is included in other revenue  income from investments in less than 20  owned companies is recognized when dividends are received as discussed in more detail in note 22 to the consolidated financial statements citigroup also consolidates entities deemed to be variable interest entities when citigroup is determined to be the primary beneficiary gains and losses on the disposition of branches subsidiaries affiliates buildings and other investments are included in other revenue  

citibank

an entity is referred to as a variable interest entity vie if it meets the criteria outlined in accounting standards codification asc topic 810 consolidation  which are i the entity has equity that is insufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties or ii the entity has equity investors that cannot make significant decisions about the entity’s operations or that do not absorb their proportionate share of the entity’s expected losses or expected returns 

the company consolidates a vie when it has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the vie’s economic performance and a right to receive benefits or the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could be potentially significant to the vie that is citi is the primary beneficiary 

 

in addition to variable interests held in consolidated vies the company has variable interests in other vies that are not consolidated because the company is not the primary beneficiary these include multiseller finance companies certain collateralized loan obligations clos many structured finance transactions and various investment funds however these vies and all other unconsolidated vies are monitored by the company to assess whether any events have occurred to cause its primary beneficiary status to change these events include 

 

all other entities not deemed to be vies with which the company has involvement are evaluated for consolidation under other subtopics of asc 810

loans for which the fair value option has not been elected are classified upon origination or acquisition as either heldforinvestment or heldforsale this classification is based on management’s initial intent and ability with regard to those loans 

loans that are heldforinvestment are classified as loans net of unearned income  on the consolidated balance sheet and the related cash flows are included within the cash flows from investing activities category in the consolidated statement of cash flows on the line change in loans  however when the initial intent for holding a loan has changed from heldforinvestment to heldforsale the loan is reclassified to heldforsale but the related cash flows continue to be reported in cash flows from investing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows on the line proceeds from sales and securitizations of loans  

consumer loans 

consumer loans represent loans and leases managed primarily by the  global consumer banking gcb  businesses and citi holdings 

consumer nonaccrual and reaging policies 

as a general rule interest accrual ceases for installment and real estate both open and closedend loans when payments are 90 days  contractually past due for credit cards and other unsecured revolving loans however citi generally accrues interest until payments are 180 days  past due as a result of occ guidance home equity loans in regulated bank entities are classified as nonaccrual if the related residential first mortgage is 90 days  or more past due also as a result of occ guidance mortgage loans in regulated bank entities discharged through chapter 7 bankruptcy other than fhainsured loans are classified as nonaccrual commercial market loans are placed on a cash nonaccrual basis when it is determined based on actual experience and a forwardlooking assessment of the collectability of the loan in full that the payment of interest or principal is doubtful or when interest or principal is 90 days  past due 

loans that have been modified to grant a concession to a borrower in financial difficulty may not be accruing interest at the time of the modification the policy for returning such modified loans to accrual status varies by product andor region in most cases a minimum number of payments ranging from one  to six  is required while in other cases the loan is never returned to accrual status for regulated bank entities such modified loans are returned to accrual status if a credit evaluation at the time of or subsequent to the modification indicates the borrower is able to meet the restructured terms and the borrower is current and has demonstrated a reasonable period of 

sustained payment performance minimum six months  of consecutive payments 

for us consumer loans generally one of the conditions to qualify for modification is that a minimum number of payments typically ranging from one  to three  must be made upon modification the loan is reaged to current status however reaging practices for certain openended consumer loans such as credit cards are governed by federal financial institutions examination council ffiec guidelines for openended consumer loans subject to ffiec guidelines one of the conditions for the loan to be reaged to current status is that at least three  consecutive minimum monthly payments or the equivalent amount must be received in addition under ffiec guidelines the number of times that such a loan can be reaged is subject to limitations generally once in 12 months and twice in five years furthermore federal housing administration fha and department of veterans affairs va loans may only be modified under those respective agencies’ guidelines and payments are not always required in order to reage a modified loan to current 

consumer chargeoff policies 

citi’s chargeoff policies follow the general guidelines below 



 

or in accordance with citi’s chargeoff policy whichever occurs earlier 

 

corporate loans 

corporate loans represent loans and leases managed by institutional clients group icg  corporate loans are identified as impaired and placed on a cash nonaccrual basis when it is determined based on actual experience and a forwardlooking assessment of the collectability of the loan in full that the payment of interest or principal is doubtful or when interest or principal is 90 days  past due except when the loan is well collateralized and in the process of collection any interest accrued on impaired corporate loans and leases is reversed at 90 days  and charged against current earnings and interest is thereafter included in earnings only to the extent actually received in cash when there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectability of principal all cash receipts are thereafter applied to reduce the recorded investment in the loan 

impaired corporate loans and leases are written down to the extent that principal is deemed to be uncollectable impaired collateraldependent loans and leases where repayment is expected to be provided solely by the sale of the underlying collateral and there are no other available and reliable sources of repayment are written down to the lower of cost or collateral value cashbasis loans are returned to accrual status when all contractual principal and interest amounts are reasonably assured of repayment and there is a sustained period of repayment performance in accordance with the contractual terms 

loans heldforsale 

corporate and consumer loans that have been identified for sale are classified as loans heldforsale and included in other assets  the practice of citi’s us prime mortgage business has been to sell substantially all of its conforming loans as such us prime mortgage conforming loans are classified as heldforsale and the fair value option is elected at origination with changes in fair value recorded in other revenue  with the exception of those loans for which the fair value option has been elected heldforsale loans are accounted for at the lower of cost or market value with any 

writedowns or subsequent recoveries charged to other revenue  the related cash flows are classified in the consolidated statement of cash flows in the cash flows from operating activities category on the line change in loans heldforsale  

allowance for loan losses 

allowance for loan losses represents management’s best estimate of probable losses inherent in the portfolio including probable losses related to large individually evaluated impaired loans and troubled debt restructurings attribution of the allowance is made for analytical purposes only and the entire allowance is available to absorb probable loan losses inherent in the overall portfolio additions to the allowance are made through the provision for loan losses  loan losses are deducted from the allowance and subsequent recoveries are added assets received in exchange for loan claims in a restructuring are initially recorded at fair value with any gain or loss reflected as a recovery or chargeoff to the provision 

consumer loans 

for consumer loans each portfolio of nonmodified smallerbalance homogeneous loans is independently evaluated for impairment by product type eg residential mortgage credit card etc in accordance with asc 450 contingencies  the allowance for loan losses attributed to these loans is established via a process that estimates the probable losses inherent in the specific portfolio this process includes migration analysis in which historical delinquency and credit loss experience is applied to the current aging of the portfolio together with analyses that reflect current and anticipated economic conditions including changes in housing prices and unemployment trends citi’s allowance for loan losses under asc 450 only considers contractual principal amounts due except for credit card loans where estimated loss amounts related to accrued interest receivable are also included 

management also considers overall portfolio indicators including historical credit losses delinquent nonperforming and classified loans trends in volumes and terms of loans an evaluation of overall credit quality the credit process including lending policies and procedures and economic geographical product and other environmental factors 

separate valuation allowances are determined for impaired smallerbalance homogeneous loans whose terms have been modified in a troubled debt restructuring tdr longterm modification programs and shortterm less than 12 months modifications that provide concessions such as interest rate reductions to borrowers in financial difficulty are reported as tdrs in addition loan modifications that involve a trial period are reported as tdrs at the start of the trial period the allowance for loan losses for tdrs is determined in accordance with asc 3101035 receivables—subsequent measurement  formerly sfas 114 considering all available evidence including as appropriate the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s original contractual effective rate the secondary market value of the loan and the fair value of 

 

collateral less disposal costs these expected cash flows incorporate modification program default rate assumptions the original contractual effective rate for credit card loans is the premodification rate which may include interest rate increases under the original contractual agreement with the borrower 

valuation allowances for commercial market loans which are classifiably managed consumer loans are determined in the same manner as for corporate loans and are described in more detail in the following section generally an assetspecific component is calculated under asc 3101035 on an individual basis for largerbalance nonhomogeneous loans that are considered impaired and the allowance for the remainder of the classifiably managed consumer loan portfolio is calculated under asc 450 using a statistical methodology that may be supplemented by management adjustment 

corporate loans 

in the corporate portfolios the allowance for loan losses  includes an assetspecific component and a statistically based component the assetspecific component is calculated under asc 3101035 on an individual basis for largerbalance nonhomogeneous loans which are considered impaired an assetspecific allowance is established when the discounted cash flows collateral value less disposal costs or observable market price of the impaired loan are lower than its carrying value this allowance considers the borrower’s overall financial condition resources and payment record the prospects for support from any financially responsible guarantors discussed further below and if appropriate the realizable value of any collateral the assetspecific component of the allowance for smaller balance impaired loans is calculated on a pool basis considering historical loss experience 

the allowance for the remainder of the loan portfolio is determined under asc 450 using a statistical methodology supplemented by management judgment the statistical analysis considers the portfolio’s size remaining tenor and credit quality as measured by internal risk ratings assigned to individual credit facilities which reflect probability of default and loss given default the statistical analysis considers historical default rates and historical loss severity in the event of default including historical average levels and historical variability the result is an estimated range for inherent losses the best estimate within the range is then determined by management’s quantitative and qualitative assessment of current conditions including general economic conditions specific industry and geographic trends and internal factors including portfolio concentrations trends in internal credit quality indicators and current and past underwriting standards 

for both the assetspecific and the statistically based components of the allowance for loan losses  management may incorporate guarantor support the financial wherewithal of the guarantor is evaluated as applicable based on net worth cash flow statements and personal or company financial statements which are updated and reviewed at least annually citi seeks performance on 

guarantee arrangements in the normal course of business seeking performance entails obtaining satisfactory cooperation from the guarantor or borrower in the specific situation this regular cooperation is indicative of pursuit and successful enforcement of the guarantee the exposure is reduced without the expense and burden of pursuing a legal remedy a guarantor’s reputation and willingness to work with citigroup is evaluated based on the historical experience with the guarantor and the knowledge of the marketplace in the rare event that the guarantor is unwilling or unable to perform or facilitate borrower cooperation citi pursues a legal remedy however enforcing a guarantee via legal action against the guarantor is not the primary means of resolving a troubled loan situation and rarely occurs if citi does not pursue a legal remedy it is because citi does not believe that the guarantor has the financial wherewithal to perform regardless of legal action or because there are legal limitations on simultaneously pursuing guarantors and foreclosure a guarantor’s reputation does not impact citi’s decision or ability to seek performance under the guarantee 

in cases where a guarantee is a factor in the assessment of loan losses it is included via adjustment to the loan’s internal risk rating which in turn is the basis for the adjustment to the statistically based component of the allowance for loan losses  to date it is only in rare circumstances that an impaired commercial loan or commercial real estate loan is carried at a value in excess of the appraised value due to a guarantee 

when citi’s monitoring of the loan indicates that the guarantor’s wherewithal to pay is uncertain or has deteriorated there is either no change in the risk rating because the guarantor’s credit support was never initially factored in or the risk rating is adjusted to reflect that uncertainty or deterioration accordingly a guarantor’s ultimate failure to perform or a lack of legal enforcement of the guarantee does not materially impact the allowance for loan losses as there is typically no further significant adjustment of the loan’s risk rating at that time where citi is not seeking performance under the guarantee contract it provides for loan losses as if the loans were nonperforming and not guaranteed 

reserve estimates and policies 

management provides reserves for an estimate of probable losses inherent in the funded loan portfolio on the consolidated balance sheet in the form of an allowance for loan losses these reserves are established in accordance with citigroup’s credit reserve policies as approved by the audit committee of the citigroup board of directors citi’s chief risk officer and chief financial officer review the adequacy of the credit loss reserves each quarter with representatives from the risk management and finance staffs for each applicable business area applicable business areas include those having classifiably managed portfolios where internal creditrisk ratings are assigned primarily icg and gcb  or modified consumer loans where concessions were granted due to the borrowers’ financial difficulties 

the abovementioned representatives for these business areas present recommended reserve balances for their funded 

 

and unfunded lending portfolios along with supporting quantitative and qualitative data discussed below 

estimated probable losses for nonperforming nonhomogeneous exposures within a business line’s classifiably managed portfolio and impaired smallerbalance homogeneous loans whose terms have been modified due to the borrowers’ financial difficulties where it was determined that a concession was granted to the borrower  consideration may be given to the following as appropriate when determining this estimate i the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s original effective rate ii the borrower’s overall financial condition resources and payment record and iii the prospects for support from financially responsible guarantors or the realizable value of any collateral in the determination of the allowance for loan losses for tdrs management considers a combination of historical redefault rates the current economic environment and the nature of the modification program when forecasting expected cash flows when impairment is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows the entire change in present value is recorded in the provision for loan losses  

statistically calculated losses inherent in the classifiably managed portfolio for performing and de minimis nonperforming exposures  the calculation is based on i citi’s internal system of creditrisk ratings which are analogous to the risk ratings of the major rating agencies and ii historical default and loss data including rating agency information regarding default rates from 1983 to 2014 and internal data dating to the early 1970s on severity of losses in the event of default adjustments may be made to this data such adjustments include i statistically calculated estimates to cover the historical fluctuation of the default rates over the credit cycle the historical variability of loss severity among defaulted loans and the degree to which there are large obligor concentrations in the global portfolio and ii adjustments made for specific known items such as current environmental factors and credit trends 

in addition representatives from each of the risk management and finance staffs that cover business areas with delinquencymanaged portfolios containing smallerbalance homogeneous loans present their recommended reserve balances based on leading credit indicators including loan delinquencies and changes in portfolio size as well as economic trends including current and future housing prices unemployment length of time in foreclosure costs to sell and gdp this methodology is applied separately for each individual product within each geographic region in which these portfolios exist 

this evaluation process is subject to numerous estimates and judgments the frequency of default risk ratings loss recovery rates the size and diversity of individual large credits and the ability of borrowers with foreign currency obligations to obtain the foreign currency necessary for orderly debt servicing among other things are all taken into account during this review changes in these estimates could 

have a direct impact on the credit costs in any period and could result in a change in the allowance 

allowance for unfunded lending commitments 

a similar approach to the allowance for loan losses is used for calculating a reserve for the expected losses related to unfunded lending commitments and standby letters of credit this reserve is classified on the balance sheet in other liabilities  changes to the allowance for unfunded lending commitments are recorded in the provision for unfunded lending commitments  

mortgage servicing rights 

mortgage servicing rights msrs are recognized as intangible assets when purchased or when the company sells or securitizes loans acquired through purchase or origination and retains the right to service the loans mortgage servicing rights are accounted for at fair value with changes in value recorded in other revenue in the company’s consolidated statement of income 

additional information on the company’s msrs can be found in note 22 to the consolidated financial statements 

goodwill 

goodwill  represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would morelikelythannot reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 

under asc 350 intangibles—goodwill and other the company has an option to assess qualitative factors to determine if it is necessary to perform the goodwill impairment test if after assessing the totality of events or circumstances the company determines that it is not morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount no further testing is necessary if however the company determines that it is morelikelythan not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount then the company must perform the first step of the twostep goodwill impairment test 

the company has an unconditional option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any reporting period and proceed directly to the first step of the goodwill impairment test furthermore on any business dispositions goodwill is allocated to the disposed business based on the ratio of the fair value of the disposed business to the fair value of the reporting unit 

the first step requires a comparison of the fair value of the individual reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit is in excess of the carrying value the related goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no further analysis is necessary if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value this is an indication of potential impairment and a second step of testing is performed to measure the amount of impairment if any for that reporting unit 

if required the second step involves calculating the implied fair value of goodwill for each of the affected 

 

reporting units the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination which is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit determined in step one over the fair value of the net assets and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit were being acquired if the amount of the goodwill allocated to the reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill in the pro forma purchase price allocation an impairment charge is recorded for the excess a recognized impairment charge cannot exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to a reporting unit and cannot subsequently be reversed even if the fair value of the reporting unit recovers 

additional information on citi’s goodwill impairment testing can be found in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements 

intangible assets 

intangible assets including core deposit intangibles present value of future profits purchased credit card relationships other customer relationships and other intangible assets but excluding msrs are amortized over their estimated useful lives intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives primarily certain asset management contracts and trade names are not amortized and are subject to annual impairment tests an impairment exists if the carrying value of the indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds its fair value for other intangible assets subject to amortization an impairment is recognized if the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds the fair value of the intangible asset 

similar to the goodwill impairment analysis in performing the annual impairment analysis for indefinitelived intangible assets citi may and has elected to bypass the optional qualitative assessment choosing instead to perform a quantitative analysis 

other assets and other liabilities 

other assets  include among other items loans heldforsale deferred tax assets equity method investments interest and fees receivable premises and equipment including purchased and developed software repossessed assets and other receivables other liabilities  include among other items accrued expenses and other payables deferred tax liabilities and reserves for legal claims taxes unfunded lending commitments repositioning reserves and other matters 

other real estate owned and repossessed assets 

real estate or other assets received through foreclosure or repossession are generally reported in other assets  net of a valuation allowance for selling costs and subsequent declines in fair value 

securitizations 

the company primarily securitizes credit card receivables and mortgages other types of securitized assets include corporate debt instruments in cash and synthetic form 

there are two key accounting determinations that must be made relating to securitizations citi first makes a determination as to whether the securitization entity must be consolidated second it determines whether the transfer of financial assets to the entity is considered a sale under gaap if the securitization entity is a vie the company consolidates the vie if it is the primary beneficiary as discussed in “variable interest entities” above for all other securitization entities determined not to be vies in which citigroup participates consolidation is based on which party has voting control of the entity giving consideration to removal and liquidation rights in certain partnership structures only securitization entities controlled by citigroup are consolidated 

interests in the securitized and sold assets may be retained in the form of subordinated or senior interestonly strips subordinated tranches spread accounts and servicing rights in credit card securitizations the company retains a seller’s interest in the credit card receivables transferred to the trusts which is not in securitized form in the case of consolidated securitization entities including the credit card trusts these retained interests are not reported on citi’s consolidated balance sheet the securitized loans remain on 

the balance sheet substantially all of the consumer loans sold or securitized through nonconsolidated trusts by citigroup are us prime residential mortgage loans retained interests in nonconsolidated mortgage securitization trusts are classified as trading account assets  except for msrs which are included in  mortgage servicing rights  on citigroup’s consolidated balance sheet 

debt 

shortterm borrowings and longterm debt  are accounted for at amortized cost except where the company has elected to report the debt instruments including certain structured notes at fair value or the debt is in a fair value hedging relationship 

transfers of financial assets 

for a transfer of financial assets to be considered a sale i the assets must have been legally isolated from the company even in bankruptcy or other receivership ii the purchaser must have the right to pledge or sell the assets transferred or if the purchaser is an entity whose sole purpose is to engage in securitization and assetbacked financing activities through the issuance of beneficial interests and that entity is constrained from pledging the assets it receives each beneficial interest holder must have the right to sell or pledge their beneficial interests and iii the company may not have an option or obligation to reacquire the assets 

if these sale requirements are met the assets are removed from the company’s consolidated balance sheet if the conditions for sale are not met the transfer is considered to be a secured borrowing the assets remain on 

 

the consolidated balance sheet and the sale proceeds are recognized as the company’s liability a legal opinion on a sale generally is obtained for complex transactions or where the company has continuing involvement with assets transferred or with the securitization entity for a transfer to be eligible for sale accounting those opinions must state that the asset transfer would be considered a sale and that the assets transferred would not be consolidated with the company’s other assets in the event of the company’s insolvency 

for a transfer of a portion of a financial asset to be considered a sale the portion transferred must meet the definition of a participating interest a participating interest must represent a pro rata ownership in an entire financial asset all cash flows must be divided proportionately with the same priority of payment no participating interest in the transferred asset may be subordinated to the interest of another participating interest holder and no party may have the right to pledge or exchange the entire financial asset unless all participating interest holders agree otherwise the transfer is accounted for as a secured borrowing 

see note 22 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

risk management activities—derivatives used for hedging purposes 

the company manages its exposures to market rate movements outside its trading activities by modifying the asset and liability mix either directly or through the use of derivative financial products including interestrate swaps futures forwards and purchased options as well as foreignexchange contracts these enduser derivatives are carried at fair value in other assets other liabilities trading account assets  and trading account liabilities  

to qualify as an accounting hedge under the hedge accounting rules versus an economic hedge where hedge accounting is not sought a derivative must be highly effective in offsetting the risk designated as being hedged the hedge relationship must be formally documented at inception detailing the particular risk management objective and strategy for the hedge this includes the item and risk being hedged the derivative being used and how effectiveness will be assessed and ineffectiveness measured the effectiveness of these hedging relationships is evaluated both on a retrospective and prospective basis typically using quantitative measures of correlation with hedge ineffectiveness measured and recorded in current earnings 

if a hedge relationship is not highly effective it no longer qualifies as an accounting hedge and hedge accounting may not be applied any gains or losses attributable to the derivatives as well as subsequent changes in fair value are recognized in other revenue  or principal transactions  with no offset to the hedged item similar to trading derivatives 

the foregoing criteria are applied on a decentralized basis consistent with the level at which market risk is managed but are subject to various limits and controls the underlying asset liability or forecasted transaction may be an individual item or a portfolio of similar items 

for fair value hedges in which derivatives hedge the fair value of assets or liabilities changes in the fair value of derivatives are reflected in other revenue  together with changes in the fair value of the hedged item related to the hedged risk these amounts are expected to and generally do offset each other any net amount representing hedge ineffectiveness is reflected in current earnings citigroup’s fair value hedges are primarily hedges of fixedrate longterm debt and availableforsale securities 

for cash flow hedges in which derivatives hedge the variability of cash flows related to floating and fixedrate assets liabilities or forecasted transactions the accounting treatment depends on the effectiveness of the hedge to the extent these derivatives are effective in offsetting the variability of the hedged cash flows the effective portion of the changes in the derivatives’ fair values will not be included in current earnings but is reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  these changes in fair value will be included in earnings of future periods when the hedged cash flows impact earnings to the extent these derivatives are not effective changes in their fair values are immediately included in other revenue  citigroup’s cash flow hedges primarily include hedges of floatingrate debt and floatingrate assets including loans and securities 

purchased under agreements to resell as well as rollovers of shortterm fixedrate liabilities and floatingrate liabilities and forecasted debt issuances 

for net investment hedges in which derivatives hedge the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation the accounting treatment will similarly depend on the effectiveness of the hedge the effective portion of the change in fair value of the derivative including any forward premium or discount is reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  as part of the foreign currency translation adjustment 

for those accounting hedge relationships that are terminated or when hedge designations are removed the hedge accounting treatment described in the paragraphs above is no longer applied instead the enduser derivative is terminated or transferred to the trading account for fair value hedges any changes in the fair value of the hedged item remain as part of the basis of the asset or liability and are ultimately reflected as an element of the yield for cash flow hedges any changes in fair value of the enduser derivative remain in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  and are included in earnings of future periods when the hedged cash flows impact earnings however if it becomes probable that some or all of the hedged forecasted transactions will not occur any amounts that remain in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  related to these transactions are immediately reflected in other revenue  

enduser derivatives that are economic hedges rather than qualifying for hedge accounting are also carried at fair value with changes in value included in principal transactions  or other revenue  citigroup often uses economic hedges when qualifying for hedge accounting would be too complex or operationally burdensome examples are hedges of the credit risk component of 

 

commercial loans and loan commitments citigroup periodically evaluates its hedging strategies in other areas and may designate either a qualifying hedge or an economic hedge after considering the relative costs and benefits economic hedges are also employed when the hedged item itself is marked to market through current earnings such as hedges of commitments to originate onetofourfamily mortgage loans to be held for sale and msrs see note 23 to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of the company’s hedging and derivative activities 

employee benefits expense 

employee benefits expense includes current service costs of pension and other postretirement benefit plans which are accrued on a current basis contributions and unrestricted awards under other employee plans the amortization of restricted stock awards and costs of other employee benefits 

for its most significant pension and postretirement benefit plans significant plans citigroup measures and discloses plan obligations plan assets and periodic plan expense quarterly instead of annually the effect of remeasuring the significant plan obligations and assets by updating plan actuarial assumptions on a quarterly basis is reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and periodic plan expense all other plans all other plans are remeasured annually see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

stockbased compensation 

the company recognizes compensation expense related to stock and option awards over the requisite service period generally based on the instruments’ grantdate fair value reduced by expected forfeitures compensation cost related to awards granted to employees who meet certain age plus yearsofservice requirements retirementeligible employees is accrued in the year prior to the grant date in the same manner as the accrual for cash incentive compensation certain stock awards with performance conditions or certain clawback provisions are subject to variable accounting pursuant to which the associated compensation expense fluctuates with changes in citigroup’s stock price see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

the company is subject to the income tax laws of the us and its states and municipalities and the foreign jurisdictions in which it operates these tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities in establishing a provision for income tax expense the company must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws the company must also make estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions both domestic and foreign 

disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be subject to review and adjudication by the court systems of 

the various tax jurisdictions or may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit the company treats interest and penalties on income taxes as a component of income tax expense  

deferred taxes are recorded for the future consequences of events that have been recognized for financial statements or tax returns based upon enacted tax laws and rates deferred tax assets are recognized subject to management’s judgment that realization is morelikelythannot fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes” fin 48 now incorporated into asc 740 income taxes  sets out a consistent framework to determine the appropriate level of tax reserves to maintain for uncertain tax positions this interpretation uses a twostep approach wherein a tax benefit is recognized if a position is morelikelythannot to be sustained the amount of the benefit is then measured to be the highest tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely to be realized asc 740 also sets out disclosure requirements to enhance transparency of an entity’s tax reserves 

see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for a further description of the company’s tax provision and related income tax assets and liabilities 

commissions underwriting and principal transactions 

commissions revenues are recognized in income when earned underwriting revenues are recognized in income typically at the closing of the transaction principal transactions revenues are recognized in income on a tradedate basis see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the company’s revenue recognition policies for commissions and fees and note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for details of principal transactions revenue 

earnings per share 

earnings per share eps is computed after deducting preferred stock dividends the company has granted restricted and deferred share awards with dividend rights that are considered to be participating securities which are akin to a second class of common stock accordingly a portion of citigroup’s earnings is allocated to those participating securities in the eps calculation 

basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders after the allocation of dividends and undistributed earnings to the participating securities by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised it is computed after giving consideration to the weighted average dilutive effect of the company’s stock options and warrants and convertible securities and after the allocation of earnings to the participating securities 

use of estimates 

management must make estimates and assumptions that affect the consolidated financial statements and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements such 

 

estimates are used in connection with certain fair value measurements see note 25 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussions on estimates used in the determination of fair value moreover estimates are significant in determining the amounts of otherthantemporary impairments impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets provisions for probable losses that may arise from creditrelated exposures and probable and estimable losses related to litigation and regulatory proceedings and tax reserves while management makes its best judgment actual amounts or results could differ from those estimates current market conditions increase the risk and complexity of the judgments in these estimates 

cash flows 

cash equivalents are defined as those amounts included in cash and due from banks  cash flows from risk management activities are classified in the same category as the related assets and liabilities 

related party transactions 

the company has related party transactions with certain of its subsidiaries and affiliates these transactions which are primarily shortterm in nature include cash accounts collateralized financing transactions margin accounts derivative transactions charges for operational support and the borrowing and lending of funds and are entered into in the ordinary course of business 

accounting changes 

debt issuance costs 

in april 2015 the fasb issued accounting standards update asu 201503 interest—imputation of interest subtopic 83530 simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs  to conform the presentation of debt issuance costs to that of debt discounts and premiums thus the asu requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability the guidance is effective beginning on january 1 2016 however citi elected to early adopt the asu on july 1 2015 which resulted in an approximately 150 million  reclassification from other assets  to longterm debt  the retrospective application was deemed immaterial and as such prior periods were not restated 

accounting for investments in tax credit partnerships 

in january 2014 the fasb issued asu no 201401 investments—equity method and joint ventures topic 323 accounting for investments in qualified affordable housing projects  any transition adjustment is reflected as an adjustment to retained earnings in the earliest period presented retrospective application 

the asu is applicable to citi’s portfolio of low income housing tax credit lihtc partnership interests the new standard widens the scope of investments eligible to elect to apply a new alternative method the proportional amortization method under which the cost of the investment 

is amortized to tax expense in proportion to the amount of tax credits and other tax benefits received citi qualifies to elect the proportional amortization method under the asu for its entire lihtc portfolio these investments were previously accounted for under the equity method which resulted in losses due to amortization of the investment being recognized in other revenue  and tax credits and benefits being recognized in the income tax expense  line in contrast the proportional amortization method combines the amortization of the investment and receipt of the tax creditsbenefits into one line income tax expense  

citi adopted asu 201401 in the first quarter of 2015 

the adoption of this asu was applied retrospectively and cumulatively reduced retained earnings  by approximately 349 million  other assets  by approximately 178 million  and deferred tax assets by approximately 171 million  

accounting for repurchasetomaturity transactions 

in june 2014 the fasb issued asu no 201411 transfers and servicing topic 860 repurchasetomaturity transactions repurchase financings and disclosures  the asu changes the accounting for repurchasetomaturity transactions and linked repurchase financings to secured borrowing accounting which is consistent with the accounting for other repurchase agreements the asu also requires disclosures about transfers accounted for as sales in transactions that are economically similar to repurchase agreements see note 23 to the consolidated financial statements and about the types of collateral pledged in repurchase agreements and similar transactions accounted for as secured borrowings see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements the asu’s provisions became effective for citi in the first quarter of 2015 with the exception of the collateral disclosures which became effective in the second quarter of 2015 the effect of adopting the asu is required to be reflected as a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption adoption of the asu did not have a material effect on the company’s financial statements 

disclosures for investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value nav per share 

in may 2015 the fasb issued asu no 201507 fair value measurement topic 820 disclosures for investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value per share or its equivalent  which is intended to reduce diversity in practice related to the categorization of investments measured at nav within the fair value hierarchy the asu removes the current requirement to categorize investments for which fair value is measured using the nav per share practical expedient within the fair value hierarchy citi elected to early adopt the asu in the second quarter of 2015 the adoption of the asu was applied retrospectively and reduced level 3 assets by 10 billion  and 11 billion  as of december 31 2015 and december 31 2014 respectively 

 

discontinued operations and significant disposals 

the fasb issued asu no 201408 presentation of financial statements topic 810 and property plant and equipment topic 360 reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity  asu 201408 in april 2014 asu 201408 changes the criteria for reporting discontinued operations while enhancing disclosures under the asu only disposals representing a strategic shift having a major effect on an entity’s operations and financial results such as a disposal of a major geographic area a major line of business or a major equity method investment may be presented as discontinued operations additionally the asu requires expanded disclosures about discontinued operations that will provide more information about the assets liabilities income and expenses of discontinued operations 

the company earlyadopted the asu in the second quarter of 2014 on a prospective basis   for all disposals or classifications as heldforsale of components of an entity that occurred on or after april 1 2014  as a result of the adoption of the asu fewer disposals will now qualify for reporting as discontinued operations however disclosure of the pretax income attributable to a disposal of a significant part of an organization that does not qualify for discontinued operations reporting is required the impact of adopting the asu was not material 

classification of certain governmentguaranteed mortgage loans upon foreclosure 

in august 2014 the fasb issued asu no 201414 receivablestroubled debt restructuring by creditors subtopic 31040 classification of certain governmentguaranteed mortgage loans upon foreclosure  which requires that a mortgage loan be derecognized and a separate other receivable be recognized upon foreclosure if the following conditions are met i the loan has a government guarantee that is not separable from the loan before foreclosure ii at the time of foreclosure the creditor has the intent to convey the real estate property to the guarantor and make a claim on the guarantee and the creditor has the ability to recover under that claim and iii at the time of foreclosure any amount of the claim that is determined on the basis of the fair value of the real estate is fixed upon foreclosure the separate other receivable is measured based on the amount of the loan balance principal and interest expected to be recovered from the guarantor 

citi early adopted the asu on a modified retrospective basis in the fourth quarter of 2014 which resulted in reclassifying approximately 130 million  of foreclosed assets from other real estate owned to a separate other receivable that is included in other assets  given the modified retrospective approach to adoption prior periods have not been restated 

future application of accounting standards 

recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities 

in january 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201601 financial instruments—overall subtopic 82510 recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities  which addresses certain aspects of recognition measurement presentation and disclosure of financial instruments 

this asu will require entities to present separately in oci the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrumentspecific credit risk dva when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments it will also require equity investments except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income thus eliminating eligibility for the current availableforsale category however federal reserve bank and federal home loan bank stock as well as exchange seats will continue to be presented at cost as a practical expedient an entity may choose to measure equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values at cost minus impairment if any plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer 

the guidance is effective beginning on january 1 2018 however early adoption is permitted only for the amendment in the asu related to presentation of dva for financial liabilities measured under the fair value option citi expects to early adopt this amendment as of january 1 2016 the impact of adopting this amendment is not expected to be material to citi’s balance sheet at january 1 2016 however in subsequent periods the changes in dva are dependent on changes in citi’s credit spreads and could be material in any given period

in february 2015 the fasb issued asu no 201502 consolidation topic 810 amendments to the consolidation analysis  which intended to improve certain areas of consolidation guidance for legal entities such as limited partnerships limited liability companies and securitization structures the asu reduced the number of consolidation models and became effective on january 1 2016 adoption of asu 201502 did not have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers  which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers the asu will replace most existing revenue 

 

recognition guidance in gaap when it becomes effective on january 1 2018 early application is permitted for annual periods beginning after december 15 2016 however the company does not expect to early adopt the asu is not applicable to financial instruments and therefore is not expected to impact a majority of the company’s revenue including net interest income the company is evaluating the effect that asu 201409 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 

accounting for financial instruments—credit losses 

in december 2012 the fasb issued a proposed asu financial instruments—credit losses  this proposed asu or exposure draft was issued for public comment in order to allow stakeholders the opportunity to review the proposal and provide comments to the fasb and does not constitute accounting guidance until a final asu is issued 

the exposure draft contains proposed guidance developed by the fasb with the goal of improving financial reporting about expected credit losses on loans securities and other financial assets held by financial institutions and other organizations the exposure draft proposes a new accounting model intended to require earlier recognition of credit losses while also providing additional transparency about credit risk 

the fasb’s proposed model would utilize an “expected credit loss” measurement objective for the recognition of credit losses for loans heldtomaturity securities and other receivables at the time the financial asset is originated or acquired and adjusted each period for changes in expected credit losses for availableforsale securities where fair value is less than cost creditrelated impairment would be recognized in an allowance for credit losses and adjusted each period for changes in credit risk this would replace the multiple existing impairment models in gaap which generally require that a loss be incurred before it is recognized 

the fasb’s proposed model represents a significant departure from existing gaap and may result in material changes to the company’s accounting for financial instruments the impact of the fasb’s final asu on the company’s financial statements will be assessed when it is issued the company expects that the final asu will be effective for citi as of january 1 2019 

lease accounting 

in february 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201602 leases topic 842 which is intended to increase transparency and comparability of accounting for lease transactions the asu will require all leases to be recognized on the balance sheet as lease assets and lease liabilities and will require both quantitative and qualitative disclosures regarding key information about leasing arrangements lessor accounting is largely unchanged the guidance is effective beginning january 1 2019 with an option to early adopt the company is evaluating whether to early adopt and the effect that asu 201602 will have on its consolidated financial statements regulatory capital and related disclosures

7 incentive plans 

  

discretionary annual incentive awards 

citigroup grants immediate cash bonus payments deferred cash awards stock payments and restricted and deferred stock awards as part of its discretionary annual incentive award program involving a large segment of citigroup’s employees worldwide most of the shares of common stock issued by citigroup as part of its equity compensation programs are to settle the vesting of the stock components of these awards 

discretionary annual incentive awards are generally awarded in the first quarter of the year based upon the previous year’s performance awards valued at less than us 100000  or the local currency equivalent are generally paid entirely in the form of an immediate cash bonus pursuant to citigroup policy andor regulatory requirements certain employees and officers are subject to mandatory deferrals of incentive pay and generally receive 25  to 60  of their awards in a combination of restricted or deferred stock and deferred cash discretionary annual incentive awards to many employees in the eu are subject to deferral requirements regardless of the total award value with 50  of the immediate incentive delivered in the form of a stock payment or stock unit award subject to a restriction on sale or transfer or hold back generally for six  months 

deferred annual incentive awards may be delivered as two  awards—a restricted or deferred stock award under citi’s capital accumulation program cap and a deferred cash award the applicable mix of cap and deferred cash awards may vary based on the employee’s minimum deferral requirement and the country of employment in some cases the entire deferral will be in the form of either a cap or deferred cash award 

subject to certain exceptions principally for retirementeligible employees continuous employment within citigroup is required to vest in cap and deferred cash awards postemployment vesting by retirementeligible employees and participants who meet other conditions is generally conditioned upon their refraining from competition with citigroup during the remaining vesting period unless the employment relationship has been terminated by citigroup under certain conditions 

generally the cap and deferred cash awards vest in equal annual installments over three  or four year periods vested cap awards are delivered in shares of common stock deferred cash awards are payable in cash and earn a fixed notional rate of interest that is paid only if and when the underlying principal award amount vests generally in the eu vested cap shares are subject to a restriction on sale or transfer after vesting and vested deferred cash awards are subject to hold back generally for six  months in each case 

unvested cap and deferred cash awards made in january 2011 or later are subject to one or more clawback provisions that apply in certain circumstances including in the case of employee risklimit violations or other misconduct or where the awards were based on earnings that were misstated cap awards made to certain employees in february 2013 and later and deferred cash awards made to certain employees in january 2012 are subject to a formulaic performancebased 

 

vesting condition pursuant to which amounts otherwise scheduled to vest will be reduced based on the amount of any pretax loss in the participant’s business in the calendar year preceding the scheduled vesting date for cap awards made in february 2013 and later a minimum reduction of 20  applies for the first dollar of loss 

in addition deferred cash awards made to certain employees in february 2013 and later are subject to a discretionary performancebased vesting condition under which an amount otherwise scheduled to vest may be reduced in the event of a “material adverse outcome” for which a participant has “significant responsibility” deferred cash awards made to these employees in february 2014 and later are subject to an additional clawback provision pursuant to which unvested awards may be canceled if the employee engaged in misconduct or exercised materially imprudent judgment or failed to supervise or escalate the behavior of other employees who did 

certain cap and other stockbased awards including those to participants in the eu that are subject to certain discretionary clawback provisions are subject to variable accounting pursuant to which the associated value of the award fluctuates with changes in citigroup’s common stock price until the date that the award is settled either in cash or shares for these awards the total amount that will be recognized as expense cannot be determined in full until the settlement date 

signon and longterm retention awards 

stock awards and deferred cash awards may be made at various times during the year as signon awards to induce new hires to join citi or to highpotential employees as longterm retention awards 

vesting periods and other terms and conditions pertaining to these awards tend to vary by grant generally recipients must remain employed through the vesting dates to vest in the awards except in cases of death disability or involuntary termination other than for “gross misconduct” these awards do not usually provide for postemployment vesting by retirementeligible participants 

outstanding unvested stock awards 

a summary of the status of unvested stock awards granted as discretionary annual incentive or signon and longterm retention awards is presented below 



 total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock awards excluding the impact of forfeiture estimates was 634 million  at december 31 2015 the cost is expected to be recognized over a weightedaverage period of 15 years  however the value of the portion of these awards that is subject to variable accounting will fluctuate with changes in citigroup’s common stock price 

performance share units 

certain executive officers were awarded a target number of performance share units psus on february 19 2013 for performance in 2012 and to a broader group of executives on february 18 2014 and february 18 2015 for performance in 2013 and 2014 respectively psus will be earned only to the extent that citigroup attains specified performance goals relating to citigroup’s return on assets and relative total shareholder return against peers over the three year period beginning with the year of award the actual dollar amounts ultimately earned could vary from zero  if performance goals are not met to as much as 150  of target if performance goals are meaningfully exceeded the value of each psu is equal to the value of one  share of citi common stock 

      psus were granted on february 16 2016 for performance in 2015 the 2016 psus are earned over a three year performance period based on citigroup’s relative total shareholder return as compared to peers the actual dollar amounts ultimately earned could vary from zero  if performance goals are not met to as much as 150  of target if performance goals are meaningfully exceeded the value of each psu is equal to the value of one  share of citi common stock 

 

      psus are subject to variable accounting pursuant to which the associated value of the award will fluctuate with changes in citigroup’s stock price and the attainment of the specified performance goals for each award until the award is settled solely in cash after the end of the performance period the value of the award subject to the performance goals is estimated using a simulation model that incorporates multiple valuation assumptions including the probability of achieving the specified performance goals of each award the riskfree rate used in the model is based on the applicable us treasury yield curve other significant assumptions for the awards are as follows 



    

  

a summary of the performance share unit activity for 2015 is presented below 



1 the weightedaverage grant date fair value per unit awarded in 2014 and 2013 was 4834  and 4226  respectively 

stock option programs 

stock options have not been granted to citi’s employees as part of the annual incentive award programs since 2009 

all outstanding stock options are fully vested with the related expense recognized as a charge to income in prior periods generally the stock options outstanding have a sixyear term with some stock options subject to various transfer restrictions cash received from employee stock option exercises under this program for the year ended december 31 2015 was approximately 634 million  

information with respect to stock option activity under citigroup’s stock option programs follows 



      the following table summarizes information about stock options outstanding under citigroup’s stock option programs at december 31 2015 



other variable incentive compensation 

citigroup has various incentive plans globally that are used to motivate and reward performance primarily in the areas of sales operational excellence and customer satisfaction participation in these plans is generally limited to employees who are not eligible for discretionary annual incentive awards 

summary 

except for awards subject to variable accounting the total expense recognized for stock awards represents the grant date fair value of such awards which is generally recognized as a charge to income ratably over the vesting period other than for awards to retirementeligible employees and immediately vested awards whenever awards are made or are expected to be made to retirementeligible employees the charge to income is accelerated based on when the applicable conditions to retirement eligibility were or will be met if the employee is retirement eligible on the grant date or the award is vested at grant date the entire expense is recognized in the year prior to grant 

recipients of citigroup stock awards generally do not have any stockholder rights until shares are delivered upon vesting or exercise or after the expiration of applicable required holding periods recipients of restricted or deferred stock awards and stock unit awards however may be entitled to receive dividends or dividendequivalent payments during the vesting period recipients of restricted stock awards generally are entitled to vote the shares in their award during 

 

the vesting period once a stock award vests the shares are freely transferable unless they are subject to a restriction on sale or transfer for a specified period 

all equity awards granted since april 19 2005 have been made pursuant to stockholderapproved stock incentive plans that are administered by the personnel and compensation committee of the citigroup board of directors which is composed entirely of independent nonemployee directors 

at december 31 2015 approximately 544 million  shares of citigroup common stock were authorized and available for grant under citigroup’s 2014 stock incentive plan the only plan from which equity awards are currently granted 

the 2014 stock incentive plan and predecessor plans permit the use of treasury stock or newly issued shares in connection with awards granted under the plans newly issued shares were distributed to settle the vesting of the majority of annual deferred stock awards in 2012 to 2015 treasury shares were used to settle vestings in the first quarter of 2016 the use of treasury stock or newly issued shares to settle stock awards does not affect the compensation expense recorded in the consolidated statement of income for equity awards 

incentive compensation cost 

the following table shows components of compensation expense relating to certain of the above incentive compensation programs recorded during 2015 2014 and 2013 



 

 

future expenses associated with outstanding unvested awards 

citi expects to record compensation expense in future periods as a result of awards granted for performance in 2015 and prior years because the awards contain service or other conditions that will be satisfied in the future the expense of these alreadygranted awards is recognized over those future periods citis expected future expenses excluding the impact of forfeitures cancellations clawbacks and repositioningrelated accelerations that have not yet occurred are summarized in the table below the portion of these awards that is subject to variable accounting will cause the expense amount to fluctuate with changes in citigroup’s common stock price 



 

8 retirement benefits 

pension and postretirement plans 

the company has several noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering certain us employees and has various defined benefit pension and termination indemnity plans covering employees outside the us 

the us qualified defined benefit plan was frozen effective january 1 2008 for most employees accordingly no additional compensationbased contributions have been credited to the cash balance portion of the plan for existing plan participants after 2007 however certain employees covered under the prior final pay plan formula continue to accrue benefits the company also offers postretirement health care and life insurance benefits to certain eligible us retired employees as well as to certain eligible employees outside the us 

the company also sponsors a number of noncontributory nonqualified pension plans these plans which are unfunded provide supplemental defined pension benefits 

 

to certain us employees with the exception of certain employees covered under the prior final pay plan formula the benefits under these plans were frozen in prior years 

the plan obligations plan assets and periodic plan expense for the company’s most significant pension and postretirement benefit plans significant plans are measured and disclosed quarterly instead of annually the significant plans captured approximately 90  of the company’s global pension and postretirement plan obligations as of december 31 2015 all other plans all other plans are measured annually with a december 31 measurement date 

net benefit expense 

the following table summarizes the components of net benefit expense recognized in the consolidated statement of income for the company’s pension and postretirement plans for significant plans and all other plans for the periods indicated 



 

the estimated net actuarial loss and prior service cost that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income loss  into net expense in 2016 are approximately 226 million  and 1 million  respectively for defined benefit 

 

pension plans for postretirement plans the estimated 2016 net actuarial loss and prior service cost benefit amortizations are approximately 35 million  and 11 million  respectively 

contributions 

the company’s funding practice for us and nonus pension and postretirement plans is generally to fund to minimum funding requirements in accordance with applicable local laws and regulations the company may increase its contributions above the minimum required contribution if appropriate in addition management has the ability to change its funding practices for the us pension plans there were no required minimum cash contributions for 2015 or 2014 

 

the following table summarizes the actual company contributions for the years ended december 31 2015  and 2014  as well as estimated expected company contributions 

for 2016 expected contributions are subject to change since contribution decisions are affected by various factors such as market performance and regulatory requirements

funded status and accumulated other comprehensive income 

the following tables summarize the funded status and amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheet for the company’s pension and postretirement plans 

 

net amount recognized 

 161 



 

the following table shows the change in accumulated other comprehensive income loss related to company’s pension and postretirement benefit plans for significant plans and all other plans for the years indicated 

 

at december 31 2015 and 2014 the aggregate projected benefit obligation pbo the aggregate accumulated benefit obligation abo and the aggregate fair value of plan assets are presented for all defined benefit pension plans with a pbo in excess of plan assets and for all defined benefit pension plans with an abo in excess of plan assets as follows 

 



 

at december 31 2015 and 2014 combined abo for the us and nonus qualified pension plans were more than plan assets by 1 billion  and 06 billion  respectively 

plan assumptions 

the company utilizes a number of assumptions to determine plan obligations and expenses changes in one or a combination of these assumptions will have an impact on the company’s pension and postretirement pbo funded status and benefit expense changes in the plans’ funded status resulting from changes in the pbo and fair value of plan assets will have a corresponding impact on accumulated other comprehensive income loss  

the actuarial assumptions at the respective years ended december 31 in the table below are used to measure the yearend pbo and the net periodic benefit expense for the subsequent year period since citi’s significant plans are measured on a quarterly basis the yearend rates for those plans are used to calculate the net periodic benefit expense for the subsequent year’s first quarter as a result of the quarterly measurement process the net periodic benefit expense for the significant plans is calculated at each respective quarter end based on the preceding quarterend rates as shown below for the us pension and postretirement plans the actual assumptions for the nonus pension and postretirement plans relate to the significant plans that are measured quarterly and all other plans that are measured annually 

certain assumptions used in determining pension and postretirement benefit obligations and net benefit expense for the company’s plans are shown in the following table 



 

  



discount rate 

the discount rates for the us pension and postretirement plans were selected by reference to a citigroupspecific analysis using each plan’s specific cash flows and compared with highquality corporate bond indices for reasonableness the discount rates for the nonus pension and postretirement plans are selected by reference to highquality corporate bond rates in countries that have developed corporate bond markets however where developed corporate bond markets do not exist the discount rates are selected by reference to local government bond rates with a premium added to reflect the additional risk for corporate bonds in certain countries effective in 2015 citi rounds the discount rate for all the significant plans to the nearest 5  basis points discount rates for all other plans are rounded to the nearest 10  basis points for plans in the six largest nonus countries and to the nearest 25  basis points for the remaining nonus countries 

  

expected rate of return 

the company determines its assumptions for the expected rate of return on plan assets for its us pension and postretirement plans using a “building block” approach which focuses on ranges of anticipated rates of return for each asset class a weighted average range of nominal rates is then determined based on target allocations to each asset class market performance over a number of earlier years is evaluated covering a wide range of economic conditions to determine whether there are sound reasons for projecting any past trends 

the company considers the expected rate of return to be a longterm assessment of return expectations and does not anticipate changing this assumption unless there are significant changes in investment strategy or economic conditions this contrasts with the selection of the discount rate and certain other assumptions which are reconsidered annually or quarterly for the significant plans in accordance with gaap 

the expected rate of return for the us pension and postretirement plans was 700  at december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 the expected return on assets reflects the expected annual appreciation of the plan assets and reduces the company’s annual pension expense the expected return on assets is deducted from the sum of service cost interest cost and other components of pension expense to arrive at the net pension benefit expense net pension benefit expense for the us pension plans for 2015 2014 and 2013 reflects deductions of 893 million  878 million  and 863 million  of expected returns respectively 

 

the following table shows the expected rates of return used in determining the company’s pension expense compared to the actual rate of return on plan assets during 2015 2014 and 2013 for the us pension and postretirement plans 



 

for the nonus pension plans pension expense for 2015 was reduced by the expected return of 323 million  compared with the actual return of 56 million  pension expense for 2014 and 2013 was reduced by expected returns of 384 million  and 396 million  respectively 

mortality tables 

at december 31 2015 the company maintained the retirement plan 2014 rp2014 mortality table and adopted mortality projection 2015 mp2015 projection table for the us plans 



 

adjustments were made to the rp2014 tables and to the longterm rate of mortality improvement to reflect the citigroup specific experience as a result the us qualified and nonqualified pension and postretirement plans’ pbo at december 31 2014 increased by 1209 million  and its funded status and aoci decreased by 1209 million   737 million  net of tax in addition the 2015 qualified and nonqualified pension and postretirement benefit expense increased by approximately 73 million  

sensitivities of certain key assumptions 

the following tables summarize the effect on pension expense of a onepercentagepoint change in the discount rate 



since the us qualified pension plan was frozen the majority of the prospective service cost has been eliminated and the gainloss amortization period was changed to the life expectancy for inactive participants as a result pension expense for the us qualified pension plan is driven more by interest costs than service costs and an increase in the discount rate would increase pension expense while a decrease in the discount rate would decrease pension expense 

the following tables summarize the effect on pension expense of a onepercentagepoint change in the expected rates of return 



  



  

 

health care cost trend rate 

assumed health care costtrend rates were as follows 



 

a onepercentagepoint change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects 



 

plan assets 

citigroup’s pension and postretirement plans’ asset allocations for the us plans and the target allocations by asset category based on asset fair values are as follows 



 

        thirdparty investment managers and advisers provide their services to citigroup’s us pension and postretirement plans assets are rebalanced as the company’s pension plan investment committee deems appropriate citigroup’s investment strategy with respect to its assets is to maintain a globally diversified investment portfolio across several asset classes that when combined with citigroup’s 

 

contributions to the plans will maintain the plans’ ability to meet all required benefit obligations 

citigroup’s pension and postretirement plans’ weightedaverage asset allocations for the nonus plans and the actual ranges and the weightedaverage target allocations by asset category based on asset fair values are as follows 



  

 

 

fair value disclosure 

for information on fair value measurements including descriptions of levels 1 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy and the valuation methodology utilized by the company see note 1 and note 25 to the consolidated financial statements asu 201507 removes the current requirement to categorize investments for which fair value is measured using the nav per share practical expedient within the fair value hierarchy 

 

certain investments may transfer between the fair value hierarchy classifications during the year due to changes in valuation methodology and pricing sources there were no significant transfers of investments between level 1 and level 2 during 2015 and 2014

the company’s global pension and postretirement funds’ investment strategy is to invest in a prudent manner for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits to participants the investment strategies are targeted to produce a total return that when combined with the company’s contributions to the funds will maintain the funds’ ability to meet all required benefit obligations risk is controlled through diversification of asset types and investments in domestic and international equities fixedincome securities and cash and shortterm investments the target asset allocation in most locations outside the us is primarily in equity and debt securities these allocations may vary by geographic region and country depending on the nature of applicable obligations and various other regional considerations the wide variation in the actual range of plan asset allocations for the funded nonus plans is a result of differing local statutory requirements and economic conditions for example in certain countries local law requires that all pension plan assets must be invested in fixedincome investments government funds or localcountry securities 

  

significant concentrations of risk in plan assets 

the assets of the company’s pension plans are diversified to limit the impact of any individual investment the us qualified pension plan is diversified across multiple asset classes with publicly traded fixed income hedge funds publicly traded equity and private equity representing the most significant asset allocations investments in these four asset classes are further diversified across funds managers strategies vintages sectors and geographies depending on the specific characteristics of each asset class the pension assets for the company’s nonus significant plans are primarily invested in publicly traded fixed income and publicly traded equity securities 

  

 

oversight and risk management practices 

the framework for the company’s pension oversight process includes monitoring of retirement plans by plan fiduciaries andor management at the global regional or country level as appropriate independent risk management contributes to the risk oversight and monitoring for the company’s us qualified pension plan and nonus significant pension plans although the specific components of the oversight process are tailored to the requirements of each region country and plan the following elements are common to the company’s monitoring and risk management process 

  



estimated future benefit payments   

the company expects to pay the following estimated benefit payments in future years 



prescription drugs 

in december 2003 the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 act of 2003 was enacted the act of 2003 established a prescription drug benefit under medicare known as “medicare part d” and a federal subsidy to sponsors of us retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to medicare part d the benefits provided to certain participants are at least actuarially equivalent to medicare part d and accordingly the company is entitled to a subsidy 

the subsidy reduced the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation apbo by approximately 5 million  as of december 31 2015 and 2014 and the postretirement expense by approximately 02 million  for 2015 and 2014 

the following table shows the estimated future benefit payments for the medicare part d of the us postretirement plan 



  

certain provisions of the patient protection and affordable care act of 2010 improved the medicare part d option known as the employer group waiver plan egwp with respect to the medicare part d subsidy the egwp provides prescription drug benefits that are more cost effective for medicareeligible participants and large employers effective april 1 2013 the company began sponsoring and implementing an egwp for eligible retirees the company subsidy received under the egwp for 2015 and 2014 was 116 million  and 110 million  respectively 

 

the other provisions of the act of 2010 are not expected to have a significant impact on citigroup’s pension and postretirement plans 

  

postemployment plans 

the company sponsors us postemployment plans that provide income continuation and health and welfare benefits to certain eligible us employees on longterm disability 

as of december 31 2015 and 2014 the plans’ funded status recognized in the company’s consolidated balance sheet was 183 million  and 256 million  respectively the amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  as of december 31 2015 and 2014 were 45 million  and 24 million  respectively effective january 1 2014 the company made changes to its postemployment plans that limit the period for which future disabled employees are eligible for continued company subsidized medical benefits 

the following table summarizes the components of net expense recognized in the consolidated statement of income for the company’s us postemployment plans 



the following table summarizes certain assumptions used in determining the postemployment benefit obligations and net benefit expenses for the company’s us postemployment plans 



 

defined contribution plans 

the company sponsors defined contribution plans in the us and in certain nonus locations all of which are administered in accordance with local laws the most significant defined contribution plan sponsored by the company is the citi retirement savings plan in the us formerly known as the citigroup 401k plan 

under the citi retirement savings plan eligible us employees received matching contributions of up to 6  of their eligible compensation for 2015 and 2014 subject to statutory limits additionally for eligible employees whose eligible compensation is 100000  or less a fixed contribution of up to 2  of eligible compensation is provided all company contributions are invested according to participants’ individual elections the following table summarizes the company contributions to the us and nonus plans 



9 income taxes 

details of the company’s income tax provision are presented below 

income tax provision 



   

 

tax rate 

the reconciliation of the federal statutory income tax rate to the company’s effective income tax rate applicable to income from continuing operations before noncontrolling interests and the cumulative effect of accounting changes for each of the periods indicated is as follows 



   

as set forth in the table above citi’s effective tax rate for 2015 was 300  the decline in the effective tax rate from 2014 was primarily due to a lower level of nondeductible legal and related expenses in 2015 

deferred income taxes 

deferred income taxes at december 31 related to the following 



 

unrecognized tax benefits 

the following is a rollforward of the company’s unrecognized tax benefits 



the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 that if recognized would affect citi’s effective tax rate are 09 billion  08 billion  and 08 billion  respectively the remaining uncertain tax positions have offsetting amounts in other jurisdictions or are temporary differences except for 04 billion  at december 31 2013 which was recognized in retained earnings  in 2014 

interest and penalties not included in “unrecognized tax benefits” above are a component of the provision for income taxes  



 as of december 31 2015 citi is under audit by the internal revenue service and other major taxing jurisdictions around the world it is thus reasonably possible that significant changes in the gross balance of unrecognized tax benefits may occur within the next 12 months although citi does not expect such audits to result in amounts that would cause a significant change to its effective tax rate other than as discussed below 

 citi expects to conclude its irs audit for the 20122013 cycle within the next 12 months the gross uncertain tax positions at december 31 2015 for the items that may be resolved are as much as 97 million  because of the number and nature of the issues remaining to be resolved the potential tax benefit to continuing operations could be anywhere in a range between 0  and 94 million  in addition citi may conclude certain state and local tax audits within the next 12 months the gross uncertain tax positions at december 31 2015 are as much as 222 million  in addition there is gross interest of as much as 16 million  the potential tax benefit to 

 

continuing operations could be anywhere between 0  and 155 million  including interest furthermore citi may conclude certain foreign audits within the next 12 months the gross uncertain positions at december 31 2015 are as much as 119 million  in addition there is gross interest of as much as 18 million  the potential tax benefit to continuing operations could be anywhere between 0  and 22 million  including interest the potential tax benefit to discontinued operations could be anywhere between 0  and 76 million  including interest 

the following are the major tax jurisdictions in which the company and its affiliates operate and the earliest tax year subject to examination 



foreign earnings 

foreign pretax earnings approximated 113 billion  in 2015 101 billion  in 2014 and 131 billion  in 2013 as a us corporation citigroup and its us subsidiaries are currently subject to us taxation on all foreign pretax earnings earned by a foreign branch pretax earnings of a foreign subsidiary or affiliate are subject to us taxation when effectively repatriated the company provides income taxes on the undistributed earnings of nonus subsidiaries except to the extent that such earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the united states 

at december 31 2015 452 billion  of accumulated undistributed earnings of nonus subsidiaries was indefinitely invested at the existing us federal income tax rate additional taxes net of us foreign tax credits of 127 billion  would have to be provided if such earnings were remitted currently the current year’s effect on the income tax expense from continuing operations is included in the “foreign income tax rate differential” line in the reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the company’s effective income tax rate in the table above 

income taxes are not provided for the company’s “savings bank base year bad debt reserves” that arose before 1988 because under current us tax rules such taxes will become payable only to the extent such amounts are distributed in excess of limits prescribed by federal law at december 31 2015 the amount of the base year reserves totaled approximately 358 million  subject to a tax of 125 million  

 

deferred tax assets 

as of december 31 2015 and 2014 citi had no valuation allowance on its dtas the following table summarizes citi’s dtas 



  

 

the following table summarizes the amounts of tax carryforwards and their expiration dates 



 

 

while citi’s net total dtas decreased yearoveryear the time remaining for utilization has shortened given the passage of time particularly with respect to the foreign tax credit ftc component of the dtas although realization is not assured citi believes that the realization of the recognized net dtas of 478 billion  at december 31 2015 is morelikelythannot based upon expectations as to future taxable income in the jurisdictions in which the dtas arise and available tax planning strategies as defined in asc 740 income taxes  that would be implemented if necessary to prevent a carryforward from expiring 

citi has concluded that it has the necessary positive evidence to support the full realization of its dtas specifically citi forecasts sufficient us taxable income in the carryforward periods exclusive of asc 740 tax planning strategies citi’s forecasted taxable income which will continue to be subject to overall market and global economic conditions incorporates geographic business forecasts and taxable income adjustments to those forecasts eg us taxexempt income loan loss reserves deductible for us tax reporting in subsequent years and actions intended to optimize its us taxable earnings in general citi would need to generate approximately 59 billion  of us taxable income during the ftc carryforward periods to prevent this most timesensitive component of citi’s ftcs from expiring 

in addition to its forecasted us taxable income citi has tax planning strategies available to it under asc 740 that would be implemented if necessary to prevent a carryforward from expiring these strategies include i repatriating lowtaxed foreign source earnings for which an assertion that the earnings have been indefinitely reinvested has not been made ii accelerating us taxable income into or deferring us tax deductions out of the latter years of the carryforward period eg selling appreciated assets electing straightline depreciation iii accelerating deductible temporary differences outside the us and iv selling certain assets that produce taxexempt income while purchasing assets that produce fully taxable income in addition the sale or restructuring of certain businesses can produce significant us taxable income within the relevant carryforward periods 

 based upon the foregoing discussion citi believes   the us federal and new york state and city nol carryforward period of 20  years provides enough time to fully utilize the dtas pertaining to the existing nol carryforwards and any nol that would be created by the reversal of the future net deductions that have not yet been taken on a tax return 

with respect to the ftcs component of the dtas the carryforward period is 10  years utilization of ftcs in any year is restricted to 35  of foreign source taxable income in that year however overall domestic losses that citi has incurred of approximately 54 billion  as of december 31 2015 are allowed to be reclassified as foreign source income to the extent of 50  of domestic source income produced in subsequent years such resulting foreign source income would cover the ftcs being carried forward as noted in the table above citi’s ftc carryforwards were 159 billion  as of december 31 2015 compared to 176 billion  as of december 31 2014 this decrease represented 17 billion  of the 15 billion  decrease in citi’s overall dtas during 2015 

partially offset by an increase in aoci related dtas citi believes that it will generate sufficient us taxable income within the 10 year carryforward period to be able to fully utilize the ftcs in addition to any ftcs produced in the tax return for such period which must be used prior to any carryforward utilization 

10 earnings per share 

the following is a reconciliation of the income and share data used in the basic and diluted earnings per share eps computations 



 

11 federal funds securities borrowed loaned and subject to repurchase agreements 

federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell  at their respective carrying values consisted of the following 



federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase  at their respective carrying values consisted of the following 



the resale and repurchase agreements represent collateralized financing transactions the company executes these transactions primarily through its brokerdealer subsidiaries to facilitate customer matchedbook activity and to efficiently fund a portion of the company’s trading inventory transactions executed by the company’s bank subsidiaries primarily facilitate customer financing activity 

to maintain reliable funding under a wide range of market conditions including under periods of stress citi manages these activities by taking into consideration the quality of the underlying collateral and stipulating financing tenor citi manages the risks in its collateralized financing transactions by conducting daily stress tests to account for changes in capacity tenors haircut collateral profile and client actions additionally citi maintains counterparty diversification by establishing concentration triggers and assessing counterparty reliability and stability under stress 

it is the company’s policy to take possession of the underlying collateral monitor its market value relative to the amounts due under the agreements and when necessary require prompt transfer of additional collateral in order to maintain contractual margin protection for resale and repurchase agreements when necessary the company posts additional collateral in order to maintain contractual margin protection 

collateral typically consists of government and governmentagency securities corporate and municipal bonds equities and mortgagebacked and other assetbacked securities 

 

the resale and repurchase agreements are generally documented under industry standard agreements that allow the prompt closeout of all transactions including the liquidation of securities held and the offsetting of obligations to return cash or securities by the nondefaulting party following a payment default or other type of default under the relevant master agreement events of default generally include i failure to deliver cash or securities as required under the transaction ii failure to provide or return cash or securities as used for margining purposes iii breach of representation iv crossdefault to another transaction entered into among the parties or in some cases their affiliates and v a repudiation of obligations under the agreement the counterparty that receives the securities in these transactions is generally unrestricted in its use of the securities with the exception of transactions executed on a triparty basis where the collateral is maintained by a custodian and operational limitations may restrict its use of the securities 

a substantial portion of the resale and repurchase agreements is recorded at fair value as described in notes 25  and 26  to the consolidated financial statements the remaining portion is carried at the amount of cash initially advanced or received plus accrued interest as specified in the respective agreements 

the securities borrowing and lending agreements also represent collateralized financing transactions similar to the resale and repurchase agreements collateral typically consists of government and governmentagency securities and corporate debt and equity securities 

similar to the resale and repurchase agreements securities borrowing and lending agreements are generally documented under industry standard agreements that allow the prompt closeout of all transactions including the liquidation of securities held and the offsetting of obligations to return cash or securities by the nondefaulting party following a payment default or other default by the other party under the relevant master agreement events of default and rights to use securities under the securities borrowing and lending agreements are similar to the resale and repurchase agreements referenced above 

a substantial portion of securities borrowing and lending agreements is recorded at the amount of cash advanced or received the remaining portion is recorded at fair value as the company elected the fair value option for certain securities borrowed and loaned portfolios as described in note 26  to the consolidated financial statements with respect to securities loaned the company receives cash collateral in an amount generally in excess of the market value of the securities loaned the company monitors the market value of securities borrowed and securities loaned on a daily basis and obtains or posts additional collateral in order to maintain contractual margin protection 

the enforceability of offsetting rights incorporated in the master netting agreements for resale and repurchase agreements and securities borrowing and lending agreements is evidenced to the extent that a supportive legal opinion has been obtained from counsel of recognized standing that provides the requisite level of certainty regarding the enforceability of these agreements and that the exercise of 

rights by the nondefaulting party to terminate and closeout transactions on a net basis under these agreements will not be stayed or avoided under applicable law upon an event of default including bankruptcy insolvency or similar proceeding 

a legal opinion may not have been sought or obtained for certain jurisdictions where local law is silent or sufficiently ambiguous to determine the enforceability of offsetting rights or where adverse case law or conflicting regulation may cast doubt on the enforceability of such rights in some jurisdictions and for some counterparty types the insolvency law for a particular counterparty type may be nonexistent or unclear as overlapping regimes may exist for example this may be the case for certain sovereigns municipalities central banks and us pension plans 

 

the following tables present the gross and net resale and repurchase agreements and securities borrowing and lending 

agreements and the related offsetting amount permitted under asc 2102045 the tables also include amounts related to financial instruments that are not permitted to be offset under asc 2102045 but would be eligible for offsetting to the extent that an event of default occurred and a legal opinion supporting enforceability of the offsetting rights has been obtained remaining exposures continue to be secured by financial collateral but the company may not have sought or been able to obtain a legal opinion evidencing enforceability of the offsetting right 









 

the following table presents the gross amount of liabilities associated with repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements by remaining contractual maturity as of december 31 2015  



the following table presents the gross amount of liabilities associated with repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements by class of underlying collateral as of december 31 2015  



12 brokerage receivables and brokerage 

payables 

the company has receivables and payables for financial instruments sold to and purchased from brokers dealers and customers which arise in the ordinary course of business the company is exposed to risk of loss from the inability of brokers dealers or customers to pay for purchases or to deliver the financial instruments sold in which case the company would have to sell or purchase the financial instruments at prevailing market prices credit risk is reduced to the extent that an exchange or clearing organization acts as a counterparty to the transaction and replaces the broker dealer or customer in question 

the company seeks to protect itself from the risks associated with customer activities by requiring customers to maintain margin collateral in compliance with regulatory and internal guidelines margin levels are monitored daily and customers deposit additional collateral as required where customers cannot meet collateral requirements the company may liquidate sufficient underlying financial instruments to bring the customer into compliance with the required margin level 

exposure to credit risk is impacted by market volatility which may impair the ability of clients to satisfy their obligations to the company credit limits are established and closely monitored for customers and for brokers and dealers engaged in forwards futures and other transactions deemed to be credit sensitive 

brokerage receivables and brokerage payables  consisted of the following 





 

13 trading account assets and liabilities 

trading account assets  and trading account liabilities  are carried at fair value other than physical commodities accounted for at the lower of cost or fair value and consist of the following

the following table presents realized gains and losses on the sale of investments the gross realized investment losses exclude losses from otherthantemporary impairment otti 



the company has sold certain debt securities that were classified as htm these sales were in response to significant deterioration in the creditworthiness of the issuers or securities or because the company has collected a substantial portion at least 85  of the principal outstanding at acquisition of the security in addition certain other securities were reclassified to afs investments in response to 

 

significant credit deterioration because the company generally intends to sell these reclassified securities citi recorded otti on the securities the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the carrying value of htm securities sold and reclassified to afs as well as the related gain loss or the otti losses recorded on these securities 



securities availableforsale 

the amortized cost and fair value of afs securities at december 31 were as follows 



 

at december 31 2015  the amortized cost of approximately 5212  investments in equity and fixed income securities exceeded their fair value by 2441 million  of the 2441 million  the gross unrealized losses on equity securities were 3 million  of the remainder  1331 million  represented unrealized losses on fixed income investments that have been in a grossunrealizedloss position for less than a year and of these 94  were rated investment grade and  1107 million  represented unrealized losses on fixed income investments that have been in a grossunrealizedloss position for a year or more and of these 90  were rated investment grade of the  1107 million  mentioned above 746 million  represent state and municipal securities

consisted of 39714 million  of governmentsponsored agency securities and  6557 million  of privately sponsored securities substantially all of which were backed by nonus residential mortgages 

as discussed in more detail below the company conducts periodic reviews of all securities with unrealized losses to evaluate whether the impairment is otherthantemporary any creditrelated impairment related to debt securities is recorded in earnings as otti noncreditrelated impairment is recognized in aoci if the company does not plan to sell and is not likely to be required to sell the security for other debt securities with otti the entire impairment is recognized in the consolidated statement of income

the company has the positive intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity or where applicable the exercise of any issuer call options absent any unforeseen significant changes in circumstances including deterioration in credit or changes in regulatory capital requirements 

the net unrealized losses classified in aoci primarily relate to debt securities previously classified as afs that have been transferred to htm and include any cumulative fair 

 

value hedge adjustments the net unrealized loss amount also includes any noncreditrelated changes in fair value of htm securities that have suffered credit impairment recorded in earnings the aoci balance related to htm securities is amortized over the remaining contractual life of the related securities as an adjustment of yield in a manner consistent with the accretion of any difference between the carrying value at the transfer date and par value of the same debt securities

excluded from the gross unrecognized losses presented in the above table are 453 million and 780 million of net unrealized losses recorded in aoci as of december 31 2015  and december 31 2014  respectively primarily related to the difference between the amortized cost and carrying value of htm securities that were reclassified from afs substantially all of these net unrecognized losses relate to securities that have been in a loss position for 12 months or longer at december 31 2015  and december 31 2014  

the following table presents the carrying value and fair value of htm debt securities by contractual maturity dates 

 

evaluating investments for otherthantemporary impairment 

overview 

the company conducts periodic reviews of all securities with unrealized losses to evaluate whether the impairment is otherthantemporary 

an unrealized loss exists when the current fair value of an individual security is less than its amortized cost basis unrealized losses that are determined to be temporary in nature are recorded net of tax in aoci for afs securities losses related to htm securities generally are not recorded as these investments are carried at adjusted amortized cost basis however for htm securities with creditrelated losses the credit loss is recognized in earnings as otti and any difference between the cost basis adjusted for the otti and fair value is recognized in aoci and amortized as an adjustment of yield over the remaining contractual life of the security for securities transferred to htm from trading account assets  amortized cost is defined as the fair value of the securities at the date of transfer plus any accretion income and less any impairment recognized in earnings subsequent to transfer for securities transferred to htm from afs amortized cost is defined as the original purchase cost adjusted for the cumulative accretion or amortization of any purchase discount or premium plus or minus any cumulative fair value hedge adjustments net of accretion or amortization and less any impairment recognized in earnings 

regardless of the classification of the securities as afs or htm the company assesses each position with an unrealized loss for otti factors considered in determining whether a loss is temporary include 

 

the company’s review for impairment generally entails 

 

 

debt 

the entire difference between amortized cost basis and fair value is recognized in earnings as otti for impaired debt securities that the company has an intent to sell or for which the company believes it will morelikelythannot be required to sell prior to recovery of the amortized cost basis however for those securities that the company does not intend to sell and is not likely to be required to sell only the creditrelated impairment is recognized in earnings and any noncreditrelated impairment is recorded in aoci 

for debt securities credit impairment exists where management does not expect to receive contractual principal and interest cash flows sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis of a security 

equity 

for equity securities management considers the various factors described above including its intent and ability to hold the equity security for a period of time sufficient for recovery to cost or whether it is morelikelythannot that the company will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its cost basis where management lacks that intent or ability the security’s decline in fair value is deemed to be otherthantemporary and is recorded in earnings afs equity securities deemed to be otherthantemporarily impaired are written down to fair value with the full difference between fair value and cost recognized in earnings 

management assesses equity method investments that have fair values that are less than their respective carrying values for otti fair value is measured as price multiplied by quantity if the investee has publicly listed securities if the investee is not publicly listed other methods are used see note 25  to the consolidated financial statements 

for impaired equity method investments that citi plans to sell prior to recovery of value or would likely be required to sell with no expectation that the fair value will recover prior to the expected sale date the full impairment is recognized in earnings as otti regardless of severity and duration the measurement of the otti does not include partial projected recoveries subsequent to the balance sheet date 

for impaired equity method investments that management does not plan to sell and is not likely to be required to sell prior to recovery of value the evaluation of whether an impairment is otherthantemporary is based on i whether and when an equity method investment will recover in value and ii whether the investor has the intent and ability to hold that investment for a period of time sufficient to recover the value the determination of whether the impairment is considered otherthantemporary considers the following indicators regardless of the time and extent of impairment 



 

the sections below describe the company’s process for identifying creditrelated impairments for security types that have the most significant unrealized losses as of december 31 2015  

mortgagebacked securities 

for us mortgagebacked securities and in particular for alta and other mortgagebacked securities that have significant unrealized losses as a percentage of amortized cost credit impairment is assessed using a cash flow model that estimates the principal and interest cash flows on the underlying mortgages using the securityspecific collateral and transaction structure the model distributes the estimated cash flows to the various tranches of securities considering the transaction structure and any subordination and credit enhancements that exist in that structure the cash flow model incorporates actual cash flows on the mortgagebacked securities through the current period and then estimates the remaining cash flows using a number of assumptions including default rates prepayment rates recovery rates on foreclosed properties and loss severity rates on nonagency mortgagebacked securities 

management develops specific assumptions using market data internal estimates and estimates published by rating agencies and other thirdparty sources default rates are projected by considering current underlying mortgage loan performance generally assuming the default of i 10  of current loans ii 25  of 30 – 59 day delinquent loans iii 70  of 60 – 90 day delinquent loans and iv 100  of 91  day delinquent loans these estimates are extrapolated along a default timing curve to estimate the total lifetime pool default 

 

rate other assumptions contemplate the actual collateral attributes including geographic concentrations rating actions and current market prices 

cash flow projections are developed using different stress test scenarios management evaluates the results of those stress tests including the severity of any cash shortfall indicated and the likelihood of the stress scenarios actually occurring based on the underlying pool’s characteristics and performance to assess whether management expects to recover the amortized cost basis of the security if cash flow projections indicate that the company does not expect to recover its amortized cost basis the company recognizes the estimated credit loss in earnings 

state and municipal securities 

the process for identifying credit impairments in citigroup’s afs and htm state and municipal bonds is primarily based on a credit analysis that incorporates thirdparty credit ratings citigroup monitors the bond issuers and any insurers providing default protection in the form of financial guarantee insurance the average external credit rating ignoring any insurance is aa3aa in the event of an external rating downgrade or other indicator of credit impairment ie based on instrumentspecific estimates of cash flows or probability of issuer default the subject bond is specifically reviewed for adverse changes in the amount or timing of expected contractual principal and interest payments 

for state and municipal bonds with unrealized losses that citigroup plans to sell for afs only would be morelikelythannot required to sell for afs only or will be subject to an issuer call deemed probable of exercise prior to the expected recovery of its amortized cost basis for afs and htm the full impairment is recognized in earnings 

recognition and measurement of otti 

the total otti recognized in earnings are as follows 



 



 



 

the following are 12month rollforwards of the creditrelated impairments recognized in earnings for afs and htm debt securities held that the company does not intend to sell nor likely will be required to sell

investments in alternative investment funds that calculate net asset value per share 

the company holds investments in certain alternative investment funds that calculate net asset value nav per share including hedge funds private equity funds funds of funds and real estate funds the company’s investments include coinvestments in funds that are managed by the company and investments in funds that are managed by third parties investments in funds are generally classified as nonmarketable equity securities carried at fair value the fair values of these investments are estimated using the nav per share of the company’s ownership interest in the funds where it is not probable that the company will sell an investment at a price other than the nav

15 loans 

citigroup loans are reported in two  categories—consumer and corporate these categories are classified primarily according to the segment and subsegment that manage the loans 

consumer loans 

consumer loans represent loans and leases managed primarily by the gcb  businesses in citicorp and in citi holdings the following table provides information by loan type for the periods indicated 



 

citigroup has established a risk management process to monitor evaluate and manage the principal risks associated with its consumer loan portfolio credit quality indicators that are actively monitored include delinquency status consumer credit scores fico and loan to value ltv ratios each as discussed in more detail below 

included in the loan table above are lending products whose terms may give rise to greater credit issues credit cards with belowmarket introductory interest rates and interestonly loans are examples of such products these products are closely managed using credit techniques that are intended to mitigate their higher inherent risk 

during the years  ended december 31 2015  and 2014  the company sold andor reclassified to heldforsale 258 billion             and 103 billion  respectively of consumer loans the company did not have significant purchases of consumer loans during the years ended   december 31 2015  and 2014  

 

delinquency status 

delinquency status is monitored and considered a key indicator of credit quality of consumer loans principally the us residential first mortgage loans use the mortgage bankers association mba method of reporting delinquencies which considers a loan delinquent if a monthly payment has not been received by the end of the day immediately preceding the loan’s next due date all other loans use a method of reporting delinquencies that considers a loan delinquent if a monthly payment has not been received by the close of business on the loan’s next due date 

as a general policy residential first mortgages home equity loans and installment loans are classified as nonaccrual when loan payments are 90 days  contractually past due credit cards and unsecured revolving loans generally accrue interest until payments are 180 days  past due home equity loans in regulated bank entities are classified as nonaccrual if the related residential first mortgage is 90 days  or more past due mortgage loans in regulated bank entities discharged through chapter 7 bankruptcy other than federal housing administration fhainsured loans are classified as nonaccrual commercial market loans are placed on a cash nonaccrual basis when it is determined based on actual experience and a forwardlooking assessment of the collectability of the loan in full that the payment of interest or principal is doubtful or when interest or principal is 90 days past due 

the policy for reaging modified us consumer loans to current status varies by product generally one of the conditions to qualify for these modifications is that a minimum number of payments typically ranging from one  to three  be made upon modification the loan is reaged to current status however reaging practices for certain openended consumer loans such as credit cards are governed by federal financial institutions examination council ffiec guidelines for openended consumer loans subject to ffiec guidelines one of the conditions for a loan to be reaged to current status is that at least three  consecutive minimum monthly payments or the equivalent amount must be received in addition under ffiec guidelines the number of times that such a loan can be reaged is subject to limitations generally once in 12 months and twice in five years furthermore fha and department of veterans affairs va loans are modified under those respective agencies’ guidelines and payments are not always required in order to reage a modified loan to current

delinquency status 

citi generally does not manage corporate loans on a delinquency basis   corporate loans are identified as impaired and placed on a cash nonaccrual basis when it is determined based on actual experience and a forwardlooking assessment of the collectability of the loan in full that the payment of interest or principal is doubtful or when interest or principal is 90 days past due except when the loan is well collateralized and in the process of collection any interest accrued on impaired corporate loans and leases is reversed at 90 days  and charged against current earnings and interest is thereafter included in earnings only to the extent actually received in cash when there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectability of principal all cash receipts are thereafter applied to reduce the recorded investment in the loan while corporate loans are generally managed based on their internally assigned risk rating see further discussion below the following tables present delinquency information by corporate loan type

corporate loan delinquency and nonaccrual details at december 31 2014 

 

citigroup has a risk management process to monitor evaluate and manage the principal risks associated with its corporate loan portfolio as part of its risk management process citi assigns numeric risk ratings to its corporate loan facilities based on quantitative and qualitative assessments of the obligor and facility these risk ratings are reviewed at least annually or more often if material events related to the obligor or facility warrant factors considered in assigning the risk ratings include financial condition of the obligor qualitative assessment of management and strategy amount and sources of repayment amount and type of collateral and guarantee arrangements amount and type of any contingencies associated with the obligor and the obligor’s industry and geography 

the obligor risk ratings are defined by ranges of default probabilities the facility risk ratings are defined by ranges of loss norms which are the product of the probability of default and the loss given default the investment grade rating categories are similar to the category bbbbaa3 and above as defined by sp and moody’s loans classified according to the bank regulatory definitions as special mention substandard and doubtful will have risk ratings within the noninvestment grade categories

22 securitizations and variable interest entities 

  

uses of special purpose entities 

a special purpose entity spe is an entity designed to fulfill a specific limited need of the company that organized it the principal uses of spes by citi are to obtain liquidity and favorable capital treatment by securitizing certain financial assets to assist clients in securitizing their financial assets and to create investment products for clients spes may be organized in various legal forms including trusts partnerships or corporations in a securitization the company transferring assets to an spe converts all or a portion of those assets into cash before they would have been realized in the normal course of business through the spe’s issuance of debt and equity instruments certificates commercial paper or other notes of indebtedness these issuances are recorded on the balance sheet of the spe which may or may not be consolidated onto the balance sheet of the company that organized the spe 

investors usually have recourse only to the assets in the spe but may also benefit from other credit enhancements such as a collateral account a line of credit or a liquidity facility such as a liquidity put option or asset purchase agreement because of these enhancements the spe issuances typically obtain a more favorable credit rating than the transferor could obtain for its own debt issuances this results in less expensive financing costs than unsecured debt the spe may also enter into derivative contracts in order to convert the yield or currency of the underlying assets to match the needs of the spe investors or to limit or change the credit risk of the spe citigroup may be the provider of certain credit enhancements as well as the counterparty to any related derivative contracts 

most of citigroup’s spes are variable interest entities vies as described below 

  

variable interest entities 

vies are entities that have either a total equity investment that is insufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or whose equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest ie ability to make significant decisions through voting rights and a right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity or an obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity investors that finance the vie through debt or equity interests or other counterparties providing other forms of support such as guarantees subordinated fee arrangements or certain types of derivative contracts are variable interest holders in the entity 

 

the variable interest holder if any that has a controlling financial interest in a vie is deemed to be the primary beneficiary and must consolidate the vie citigroup would be deemed to have a controlling financial interest and be the primary beneficiary if it has both of the following characteristics 

 

the company must evaluate each vie to understand the purpose and design of the entity the role the company had in the entity’s design and its involvement in the vie’s ongoing activities the company then must evaluate which activities most significantly impact the economic performance of the vie and who has the power to direct such activities 

for those vies where the company determines that it has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the vie’s economic performance the company must then evaluate its economic interests if any and determine whether it could absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the vie when evaluating whether the company has an obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant it considers the maximum exposure to such loss without consideration of probability such obligations could be in various forms including but not limited to debt and equity investments guarantees liquidity agreements and certain derivative contracts 

in various other transactions the company may i act as a derivative counterparty for example interest rate swap crosscurrency swap or purchaser of credit protection under a credit default swap or total return swap where the company pays the total return on certain assets to the spe ii act as underwriter or placement agent iii provide administrative trustee or other services or iv make a market in debt securities or other instruments issued by vies the company generally considers such involvement by itself not to be variable interests and thus not an indicator of power or potentially significant benefits or losses 

see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of impending changes to targeted areas of consolidation guidance 

citigroup’s involvement with consolidated and unconsolidated vies with which the company holds significant variable interests or has continuing involvement through servicing a majority of the assets in a vie is presented below 



 

 5 substantially all of the unconsolidated investment funds’ assets are related to retirement funds in mexico managed by citi see “investment funds” below for further discussion 

6 citi’s total involvement with citicorp spe assets was 4605 billion  and 4813 billion  as of december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively with the remainder related to citi holdings 

the previous tables do not include 

 

 

the asset balances for consolidated vies represent the carrying amounts of the assets consolidated by the company the carrying amount may represent the amortized cost or the current fair value of the assets depending on the legal form of the asset eg security or loan and the company’s standard accounting policies for the asset type and line of business 

the asset balances for unconsolidated vies where the company has significant involvement represent the most current information available to the company in most cases the asset balances represent an amortized cost basis without regard to impairments in fair value unless fair value information is readily available to the company for vies that obtain asset exposures synthetically through derivative instruments the tables generally include the full original notional amount of the derivative as an asset balance 

the maximum funded exposure represents the balance sheet carrying amount of the company’s investment in the vie it reflects the initial amount of cash invested in the vie adjusted for any accrued interest and cash principal payments received the carrying amount may also be adjusted for increases or declines in fair value or any impairment in value recognized in earnings the maximum exposure of unfunded positions represents the remaining undrawn committed amount including liquidity and credit facilities provided by the company or the notional amount of a derivative instrument considered to be a variable interest in certain transactions the company has entered into derivative instruments or other arrangements that are not considered variable interests in the vie eg interest rate swaps crosscurrency swaps or where the company is the purchaser of credit protection under a credit default swap or total return swap where the company pays the total return on certain assets to the spe receivables under such arrangements are not included in the maximum exposure amounts 

funding commitments for significant unconsolidated vies—liquidity facilities and loan commitments 

the following table presents the notional amount of liquidity facilities and loan commitments that are classified as funding commitments in the vie tables above 



consolidated vies 

the company engages in onbalance sheet securitizations which are securitizations that do not qualify for sales treatment thus the assets remain on the company’s consolidated balance sheet and any proceeds received are recognized as secured liabilities the consolidated vies included in the tables below represent hundreds of separate entities with which the company is involved in general the thirdparty investors in the obligations of consolidated vies have legal recourse only to the assets of the respective vies and do not have such recourse to the company except where the company has provided a guarantee to the investors or is the counterparty to certain derivative transactions involving 

 

the vie thus the company’s maximum legal exposure to loss related to consolidated vies is significantly less than the carrying value of the consolidated vie assets due to outstanding thirdparty financing intercompany assets and liabilities are excluded from the table all vie assets are restricted from being sold or pledged as collateral the cash flows from these assets are the only source used to pay down the associated liabilities which are nonrecourse to the company’s general assets 

the following table presents the carrying amounts and classifications of consolidated assets that are collateral for consolidated vie obligations

the following table presents the carrying amounts and classification of significant variable interests in unconsolidated vies 



credit card securitizations 

the company securitizes credit card receivables through trusts established to purchase the receivables citigroup transfers receivables into the trusts on a nonrecourse basis credit card securitizations are revolving securitizations as customers pay their credit card balances the cash proceeds are used to purchase new receivables and replenish the receivables in the trust 

substantially all of the company’s credit card securitization activity is through two trusts—citibank credit card master trust master trust and the citibank omni master trust omni trust with the substantial majority through the master trust these trusts are consolidated entities because as servicer citigroup has the power to direct 

 

the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the trusts citigroup holds a seller’s interest and certain securities issued by the trusts and also provides liquidity facilities to the trusts which could result in potentially significant losses or benefits from the trusts accordingly the transferred credit card receivables remain on citi’s consolidated balance sheet with no  gain or loss recognized the debt issued by the trusts to third parties is included on citi’s consolidated balance sheet 

the company utilizes securitizations as one of the sources of funding for its business in north america  the following table reflects amounts related to the company’s securitized credit card receivables 



the following tables summarize selected cash flow information related to citigroup’s credit card securitizations 



managed loans 

after securitization of credit card receivables the company continues to maintain credit card customer account relationships and provides servicing for receivables transferred to the trusts as a result the company considers the securitized credit card receivables to be part of the business it manages as citigroup consolidates the credit card trusts all managed securitized card receivables are onbalance sheet 

funding liquidity facilities and subordinated interests 

as noted above citigroup securitizes credit card receivables through two  securitization trusts—master trust which is part of citicorp and omni trust substantially all of which is also part of citicorp the liabilities of the trusts are included in the consolidated balance sheet excluding those retained by citigroup 

  

 

the master trust issues fixed and floatingrate term notes some of the term notes are issued to multiseller commercial paper conduits the weighted average maturity of 

the term notes issued by the master trust was 24 years  as of december 31 2015  and 28 years  as of december 31 2014  

master trust liabilities at par value 



the omni trust issues fixed and floatingrate term notes some of which are purchased by multiseller commercial paper conduits the weighted average maturity of the thirdparty term notes issued by the omni trust was 09 years  as of december 31 2015  and 19 years  as of december 31 2014  

omni trust liabilities at par value 



mortgage securitizations 

the company provides a wide range of mortgage loan products to a diverse customer base once originated the company often securitizes these loans through the use of vies these vies are funded through the issuance of trust certificates backed solely by the transferred assets these certificates have the same life as the transferred assets in addition to providing a source of liquidity and less expensive funding securitizing these assets also reduces the company’s credit exposure to the borrowers these mortgage loan securitizations are primarily nonrecourse thereby effectively transferring the risk of future credit losses to the purchasers of the securities issued by the trust however the company’s us consumer mortgage business generally retains the servicing rights and in certain instances retains investment securities interestonly strips and residual interests in future cash flows from the trusts and also provides servicing for a limited number of icg  securitizations 

the company securitizes mortgage loans generally through either a governmentsponsored agency such as ginnie mae fannie mae or freddie mac us agencysponsored 

 

mortgages or privatelabel nonagencysponsored mortgages securitization the company is not the primary beneficiary of its us agencysponsored mortgage securitizations because citigroup does not have the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance therefore citi does not consolidate these us agencysponsored mortgage securitizations 

the company does not consolidate certain nonagencysponsored mortgage securitizations because citi is either not the servicer with the power to direct the significant activities of the entity or citi is the servicer but the servicing relationship is deemed to be a fiduciary relationship therefore citi is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the entity 

in certain instances the company has i the power to direct the activities and ii the obligation to either absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could be potentially significant to its nonagencysponsored mortgage securitizations and therefore is the primary beneficiary and thus consolidates the vie 

the following tables summarize selected cash flow information related to citigroup mortgage securitizations 



1 the proceeds from new securitizations in 2015  include 07 billion  related to personal loan securitizations 

agency and nonagency securitization gains for the year ended december 31 2015  were 150 million  and 44 million  respectively 

 

agency and nonagency securitization gains for the years ended december 31 2014  and 2013  were 267 million  and 223 million  respectively 

key assumptions used in measuring the fair value of retained interests at the date of sale or securitization of mortgage receivables were as follows 





 

the interests retained by the company range from highly rated andor senior in the capital structure to unrated andor residual interests 

the key assumptions used to value retained interests and the sensitivity of the fair value to adverse changes of 10  and 20  in each of the key assumptions are set forth in the tables 

 

below the negative effect of each change is calculated independently holding all other assumptions constant because the key assumptions may not be independent the net effect of simultaneous adverse changes in the key assumptions may be less than the sum of the individual effects shown below

note citi holdings held no subordinated interests in mortgage securitizations as of december 31 2015  and december 31 2014  

 

mortgage servicing rights 

in connection with the securitization of mortgage loans the company’s us consumer mortgage business generally retains the servicing rights which entitle the company to a future stream of cash flows based on the outstanding principal balances of the loans and the contractual servicing fee failure to service the loans in accordance with contractual requirements may lead to a termination of the servicing rights and the loss of future servicing fees 

these transactions create an intangible asset referred to as mortgage servicing rights msrs which are recorded at fair value on citi’s consolidated balance sheet the fair value of citi’s capitalized msrs was 18 billion  at december 31 2015  and 2014  of these amounts approximately 17 billion  was specific to citicorp with the remainder to citi holdings as of december 31 2015  and 2014  the msrs correspond to principal loan balances of 198 billion  and 224 billion  as of december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively the following table summarizes the changes in capitalized msrs 

 





the fair value of the msrs is primarily affected by changes in prepayments of mortgages that result from shifts in mortgage interest rates specifically higher interest rates tend to lead to declining prepayments which causes the fair value of the msrs to increase in managing this risk the company economically hedges a significant portion of the value of its msrs through the use of interest rate derivative contracts forward purchase and sale commitments of mortgagebacked securities and purchased securities all classified as trading account assets  the company receives fees during the course of servicing previously securitized mortgages the amounts of these fees were as follows 



these fees and changes in msr fair values are classified in the consolidated statement of income as other revenue

as administrator to citi’s conduits the company is generally responsible for selecting and structuring assets purchased or financed by the conduits making decisions regarding the funding of the conduits including determining the tenor and other features of the commercial paper issued monitoring the quality and performance of the conduits’ assets and facilitating the operations and cash flows of the conduits in return the company earns structuring fees from customers for individual transactions and earns an administration fee from the conduit which is equal to the income from the client program and liquidity fees of the conduit after payment of conduit expenses this administration fee is fairly stable since most risks and rewards of the underlying assets are passed back to the clients once the asset pricing is negotiated most ongoing income costs and fees are relatively stable as a percentage of the conduit’s size 

the conduits administered by the company do not generally invest in liquid securities that are formally rated by third parties the assets are privately negotiated and structured transactions that are generally designed to be held by the conduit rather than actively traded and sold the yield earned by the conduit on each asset is generally tied to the rate on the commercial paper issued by the conduit thus passing interest rate risk to the client each asset purchased by the conduit is structured with transactionspecific credit enhancement features provided by the thirdparty client seller including over collateralization cash and excess spread collateral accounts direct recourse or thirdparty guarantees these credit enhancements are sized with the objective of approximating a credit rating of a or above based on the 

company’s internal risk ratings at december 31 2015  and 2014  the conduits had approximately 213 billion  and 292 billion  of purchased assets outstanding respectively and had incremental funding commitments with clients of approximately 116 billion  and 135 billion  respectively 

substantially all of the funding of the conduits is in the form of shortterm commercial paper at december 31 2015  and 2014  the weighted average remaining lives of the commercial paper issued by the conduits were approximately 56  and 57 days  respectively 

the primary credit enhancement provided to the conduit investors is in the form of transactionspecific credit enhancements described above in addition to the transactionspecific credit enhancements the conduits other than the government guaranteed loan conduit have obtained a letter of credit from the company which is equal to at least 8  to 10  of the conduit’s assets with a minimum of 200 million  the letters of credit provided by the company to the conduits total approximately 19 billion  and 23 billion  as of december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively the net result across multiseller conduits administered by the company other than the government guaranteed loan conduit is that in the event defaulted assets exceed the transactionspecific credit enhancements described above any losses in each conduit are allocated first to the company and then the commercial paper investors 

the company also provides the conduits with two forms of liquidity agreements that are used to provide funding to the conduits in the event of a market disruption among other events each asset of the conduits is supported by a transactionspecific liquidity facility in the form of an asset purchase agreement apa under the apa the company has generally agreed to purchase nondefaulted eligible receivables from the conduit at par the apa is not designed to provide credit support to the conduit as it generally does not permit the purchase of defaulted or impaired assets any funding under the apa will likely subject the underlying conduit clients to increased interest costs in addition the company provides the conduits with programwide liquidity in the form of shortterm lending commitments under these commitments the company has agreed to lend to the conduits in the event of a shortterm disruption in the commercial paper market subject to specified conditions the company receives fees for providing both types of liquidity agreements and considers these fees to be on fair market terms 

finally the company is one of several named dealers in the commercial paper issued by the conduits and earns a marketbased fee for providing such services along with thirdparty dealers the company makes a market in the commercial paper and may from time to time fund commercial paper pending sale to a third party on specific dates with less liquidity in the market the company may hold in inventory commercial paper issued by conduits administered by the company as well as conduits administered by third parties separately in the normal course of business the company invests in commercial paper including commercial paper issued by the companys conduits at december 31 2015  and 2014  the company owned 114 billion  and 106 billion  respectively of the commercial paper issued by its administered conduits the companys investments were not 

 

driven by market illiquidity and the company is not obligated under any agreement to purchase the commercial paper issued by the conduits 

the assetbacked commercial paper conduits are consolidated by the company the company has determined that through its roles as administrator and liquidity provider it has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities’ economic performance these powers include its ability to structure and approve the assets purchased by the conduits its ongoing surveillance and credit mitigation activities its ability to sell or repurchase assets out of the conduits and its liability management in addition as a result of all the company’s involvement described above it was concluded that the company has an economic interest that could potentially be significant however the assets and liabilities of the conduits are separate and apart from those of citigroup no assets of any conduit are available to satisfy the creditors of citigroup or any of its other subsidiaries 

collateralized loan obligations 

a collateralized loan obligation clo is a vie that purchases a portfolio of assets consisting primarily of noninvestment grade corporate loans the clo issues multiple tranches of debt and equity to investors to fund the asset purchases and pay upfront expenses associated with forming the clo a thirdparty asset manager is contracted by the clo to purchase the underlying assets from the open market and monitor the credit risk associated with those assets over the term of the clo the asset manager directs purchases and sales of assets in a manner consistent with the clo’s asset management agreement and indenture in general the clo asset manager will have the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the economic performance of the clo investors in the clo through their ownership of debt andor equity in the clo can also direct certain activities of the clo including removing the clo asset manager under limited circumstances optionally redeeming the notes voting on amendments to the clo’s operating documents and other activities the clo has a finite life typically 12 years 

citi serves as a structuring and placement agent with respect to the clo typically the debt and equity of the clo are sold to thirdparty investors on occasion certain citi entities may purchase some portion of the clo’s liabilities for investment purposes in addition citi may purchase typically in the secondary market certain securities issued by the clo to support its market making activities 

the company does not generally have the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the economic performance of the clos as this power is generally held by a thirdparty asset manager of the clo as such those clos are not consolidated 

key assumptions and retained interests 

the key assumptions used to value retained interests in clos and the sensitivity of the fair value to adverse changes of 10 and 20 are set forth in the tables below 





assetbased financing 

the company provides loans and other forms of financing to vies that hold assets those loans are subject to the same credit approvals as all other loans originated or purchased by the company financings in the form of debt securities or derivatives are in most circumstances reported in trading account assets  and accounted for at fair value through earnings the company generally does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact these vies’ economic performance and thus it does not consolidate them 

the primary types of citigroup’s assetbased financings total assets of the unconsolidated vies with significant involvement and the company’s maximum exposure to loss are shown below for the company to realize the maximum loss the vie borrower would have to default with no recovery from the assets held by the vie 







 

the following table summarizes selected cash flow information related to assetbased financings 



there were no  gains recognized on the securitizations of assetbased financings for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  

municipal securities tender option bond tob trusts 

municipal tob trusts may hold fixed or floatingrate taxable or taxexempt securities issued by state and local governments and municipalities tob trusts are typically structured as singleissuer entities whose assets are purchased from either the company or from other investors in the municipal securities market tob trusts finance the purchase of their municipal assets by issuing two classes of certificates longdated floating rate certificates “floaters” that are putable pursuant to a liquidity facility and residual interest certificates “residuals” the floaters are purchased by thirdparty investors typically taxexempt money market funds the residuals are purchased by the original owner of the municipal securities that are being financed 

from the company’s perspective there are two  types of tob trusts customer tob trusts and noncustomer tob trusts customer tob trusts are those trusts utilized by customers of the company to finance their municipal securities investments the residuals issued by these trusts are purchased by the customer being financed noncustomer tob trusts are trusts that are used by the company to finance its own municipal securities investments the residuals issued by noncustomer tob trusts are purchased by the company 

with respect to both customer and noncustomer tob trusts the company may provide remarketing agent services if floaters are optionally tendered and the company in its role as remarketing agent is unable to find a new investor to purchase the optionally tendered floaters within a specified period of time the company may but is not obligated to purchase the tendered floaters into its own inventory the level of the company’s inventory of such floaters fluctuates at december 31 2015  and 2014  the company held 2 million  and 3 million  respectively of floaters related to customer and noncustomer tob trusts 

for certain customer tob trusts the company may also serve as a voluntary advance provider in this capacity the company may but is not obligated to make loan advances to customer tob trusts to purchase optionally tendered floaters that have not otherwise been successfully remarketed to new investors such loans are secured by pledged floaters as of december 31 2015  the company had no outstanding voluntary advances to customer tob trusts 

for certain noncustomer trusts the company also provides credit enhancement at december 31 2015  and 2014  approximately 82 million  and 198 million  respectively of the municipal bonds owned by noncustomer tob trusts are subject to a credit guarantee provided by the company 

the company also provides liquidity services to many customer and noncustomer trusts if a trust is unwound early due to an event other than a credit event on the underlying municipal bonds the underlying municipal bonds are sold out of the trust and bond sale proceeds are used to redeem the outstanding trust certificates if this results in a shortfall between the bond sale proceeds and the redemption price of the tendered floaters the company pursuant to the liquidity agreement would be obligated to make a payment to the trust to satisfy that shortfall for certain customer tob trusts the company has also executed a reimbursement agreement with the holder of the residual pursuant to which the residual holder is obligated to reimburse the company for any payment the company makes under the liquidity arrangement these reimbursement agreements may be subject to daily margining based on changes in the market value of the underlying municipal bonds in cases where a third party provides liquidity to a noncustomer tob trust a similar reimbursement arrangement may be executed whereby the company or a consolidated subsidiary of the company as residual holder would absorb any losses incurred by the liquidity provider 

for certain other noncustomer tob trusts the company serves as tender option provider the tender option provider arrangement allows floater holders to put their interests directly to the company at any time subject to the requisite notice period requirements at a price of par 

at december 31 2015  and 2014  liquidity agreements provided with respect to customer tob trusts totaled 31 billion  and 37 billion  respectively of which 22 billion  and 26 billion  respectively were offset by reimbursement agreements for the remaining exposure related to tob transactions where the residual owned by the customer was at least 25  of the bond value at the inception of the transaction no reimbursement agreement was executed 

the company considers both customer and noncustomer tob trusts to be vies customer tob trusts are not consolidated by the company as the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the trust’s economic performance rests with the customer residual holder which may unilaterally cause the sale of the trust’s bonds 

noncustomer tob trusts generally are consolidated because the company holds the residual interest and thus has the unilateral power to cause the sale of the trust’s bonds 

the company also provides other liquidity agreements or letters of credit to customersponsored municipal investment funds which are not variable interest entities and municipalityrelated issuers that totaled 81 billion  and 74 billion  as of december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively these liquidity agreements and letters of credit are offset by reimbursement agreements with various termout provisions 

 

municipal investments 

municipal investment transactions include debt and equity interests in partnerships that finance the construction and rehabilitation of lowincome housing facilitate lending in new or underserved markets or finance the construction or operation of renewable municipal energy facilities the company generally invests in these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits and grants earned from the investments made by the partnership the company may also provide construction loans or permanent loans for the development or operation of real estate properties held by partnerships these entities are generally considered vies the power to direct the activities of these entities is typically held by the general partner accordingly these entities are not consolidated by the company 

client intermediation 

client intermediation transactions represent a range of transactions designed to provide investors with specified returns based on the returns of an underlying security referenced asset or index these transactions include creditlinked notes and equitylinked notes in these transactions the vie typically obtains exposure to the underlying security referenced asset or index through a derivative instrument such as a totalreturn swap or a creditdefault swap in turn the vie issues notes to investors that pay a return based on the specified underlying security referenced asset or index the vie invests the proceeds in a financial asset or a guaranteed insurance contract that serves as collateral for the derivative contract over the term of the transaction the company’s involvement in these transactions includes being the counterparty to the vie’s derivative instruments and investing in a portion of the notes issued by the vie in certain transactions the investor’s maximum risk of loss is limited and the company absorbs risk of loss above a specified level the company does not have the power to direct the activities of the vies that most significantly impact their economic performance and thus it does not consolidate them 

the company’s maximum risk of loss in these transactions is defined as the amount invested in notes issued by the vie and the notional amount of any risk of loss absorbed by the company through a separate instrument issued by the vie the derivative instrument held by the company may generate a receivable from the vie for example where the company purchases credit protection from the vie in connection with the vie’s issuance of a creditlinked note which is collateralized by the assets owned by the vie these derivative instruments are not considered variable interests and any associated receivables are not included in the calculation of maximum exposure to the vie 

the proceeds from new securitizations related to the company’s client intermediation transactions for the years ended december 31 2015  and 2014  totaled approximately 20 billion  

investment funds 

the company is the investment manager for certain investment funds and retirement funds that invest in various asset classes including private equity hedge funds real estate fixed income and infrastructure the company earns a management fee which is a percentage of capital under management and may earn performance fees in addition for some of these funds the company has an ownership interest in the investment funds the company has also established a number of investment funds as opportunities for qualified employees to invest in private equity investments the company acts as investment manager to these funds and may provide employees with financing on both recourse and nonrecourse bases for a portion of the employees’ investment commitments 

the company has determined that a majority of the investment entities managed by citigroup are provided a deferral from the requirements of asc 810 because they meet the criteria in accounting standards update no 201010 consolidation topic 810 amendments for certain investment funds asu 201010 these entities continue to be evaluated under the requirements of asc 81010 prior to the implementation of sfas 167 fin 46r consolidation of variable interest entities  which required that a vie be consolidated by the party with a variable interest that will absorb a majority of the entity’s expected losses or residual returns or both see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of asu 201502 which includes impending changes to targeted areas of consolidation guidance when asu 201502 becomes effective on january 1 2016 it will eliminate the above noted deferral for certain investment entities pursuant to asu 201010 

23 derivatives activities 

in the ordinary course of business citigroup enters into various types of derivative transactions these derivative 

transactions include   

 

swaps and forwards and some option contracts are overthecounter otc derivatives that are bilaterally negotiated with counterparties and settled with those counterparties except for swap contracts that are novated and cleared through central counterparties ccps futures contracts and other option contracts are standardized contracts that are traded on an exchange with a ccp as the counterparty from the inception of the transaction citigroup enters into these derivative contracts relating to interest rate foreign currency commodity and other marketcredit risks for the following reasons 



 

derivatives may expose citigroup to market credit or liquidity risks in excess of the amounts recorded on the consolidated balance sheet market risk on a derivative product is the exposure created by potential fluctuations in interest rates foreignexchange rates and other factors and is a function of the type of product the volume of transactions the tenor and terms of the agreement and the underlying volatility credit risk is the exposure to loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the transaction where the value of any collateral held is not adequate to cover such losses the recognition in earnings of unrealized gains on these transactions is subject to management’s assessment of the probability of counterparty default liquidity risk is the potential exposure that arises when the size of a derivative position may not be able to be monetized in a reasonable period of time and at a reasonable cost in periods of high volatility and financial stress 

derivative transactions are customarily documented under industry standard master agreements that provide that following an uncured payment default or other event of default the nondefaulting party may promptly terminate all transactions between the parties and determine the net amount due to be paid to or by the defaulting party events of default include i failure to make a payment on a derivatives transaction that remains uncured following applicable notice and grace periods ii breach of agreement that remains uncured after applicable notice and grace periods iii breach of a representation iv cross default either to thirdparty debt or to other derivative transactions entered into between the parties or in some cases their affiliates v the occurrence of a merger or consolidation which results in a party’s becoming a materially weaker credit and vi the cessation or repudiation of any applicable guarantee or other credit support document obligations under master netting agreements are often secured by collateral posted under an industry standard credit support annex to the master netting agreement an event of default may also occur under a credit support annex if a party fails to make a collateral delivery that remains uncured following applicable notice and grace periods 

the netting and collateral rights incorporated in the master netting agreements are considered to be legally enforceable if a supportive legal opinion has been obtained from counsel of recognized standing that provides the requisite level of certainty regarding enforceability and that the exercise of rights by the nondefaulting party to terminate and closeout transactions on a net basis under these agreements will not be stayed or avoided under applicable law upon an event of default including bankruptcy insolvency or similar proceeding 

a legal opinion may not be sought for certain jurisdictions where local law is silent or unclear as to the enforceability of such rights or where adverse case law or conflicting regulation may cast doubt on the enforceability of such rights in some jurisdictions and for some counterparty types the insolvency law may not provide the requisite level of certainty for example this may be the case for certain sovereigns municipalities central banks and us pension plans 

exposure to credit risk on derivatives is affected by market volatility which may impair the ability of counterparties to satisfy their obligations to the company credit limits are established and closely monitored for customers engaged in derivatives transactions citi considers the level of legal certainty regarding enforceability of its offsetting rights under master netting agreements and credit support annexes to be an important factor in its risk management process specifically citi generally transacts much lower volumes of derivatives under master netting agreements where citi does not have the requisite level of legal certainty regarding enforceability because such derivatives consume greater amounts of single counterparty credit limits than those executed under enforceable master netting agreements 

cash collateral and security collateral in the form of g10 government debt securities is often posted by a party to a master netting agreement to secure the net open exposure of the other party the receiving party is free to comminglerehypothecate such collateral in the ordinary course of its business nonstandard collateral such as corporate bonds municipal bonds us agency securities andor mbs may also be pledged as collateral for derivative transactions security collateral posted to open and maintain a master netting agreement with a counterparty in the form of cash andor securities may from time to time be segregated in an account at a thirdparty custodian pursuant to a triparty account control agreement 

information pertaining to citigroup’s derivative activity based on notional amounts is presented in the table below derivative notional amounts are reference amounts from which contractual payments are derived and do not represent a complete and accurate measure of citi’s exposure to derivative transactions rather as discussed above citi’s derivative exposure arises primarily from market fluctuations ie market risk counterparty failure ie credit risk andor periods of high volatility or financial stress ie liquidity risk as well as any market valuation adjustments that may be 

 

required on the transactions moreover notional amounts do not reflect the netting of offsetting trades also as discussed above for example if citi enters into an interest rate swap with 100 million  notional and offsets this risk with an identical but opposite position with a different counterparty 200 million  in derivative notionals is reported although these offsetting positions may result in de minimis overall market risk aggregate derivative notional amounts can fluctuate from period to period in the normal course of business based on citi’s market share levels of client activity and other factors

the following tables present the gross and net fair values of the company’s derivative transactions and the related offsetting amounts permitted under asc 2102045 and asc 8151045 as of december 31 2015  and december 31 2014  under asc 2102045 gross positive fair values are offset against gross negative fair values by counterparty pursuant to enforceable master netting agreements under asc 8151045 payables and receivables in respect of cash collateral received from or paid to a given counterparty pursuant to a credit support annex are included in the offsetting amount if a legal opinion supporting enforceability of netting and collateral rights has been obtained gaap does not permit similar offsetting for security collateral the tables also include amounts that are not permitted to be offset under asc 2102045 and asc 8151045 such as security collateral posted or cash collateral posted at thirdparty custodians but which would be eligible for offsetting to the extent an event of default occurred and a legal opinion supporting enforceability of the netting and collateral rights has been obtained

for the years ended   december 31 2015  2014  and 2013 the amounts recognized in principal transactions  in the consolidated statement of income related to derivatives not designated in a qualifying hedging relationship as well as the underlying nonderivative instruments are presented in note 6  to the consolidated financial statements citigroup presents this disclosure by business classification showing derivative gains and losses related to its trading activities together with gains and losses related to nonderivative instruments within the same trading portfolios as this represents the way these portfolios are risk managed 

the amounts recognized in other revenue  in the consolidated statement of income related to derivatives not designated in a qualifying hedging relationship are shown below the table below does not include any offsetting gainslosses on the economically hedged items to the extent such amounts are also recorded in other revenue  

 



accounting for derivative hedging 

citigroup accounts for its hedging activities in accordance with asc 815 derivatives and hedging  as a general rule hedge accounting is permitted where the company is exposed to a particular risk such as interestrate or foreignexchange risk that causes changes in the fair value of an asset or liability or variability in the expected future cash flows of an existing asset liability or a forecasted transaction that may affect earnings 

derivative contracts hedging the risks associated with changes in fair value are referred to as fair value hedges while contracts hedging the variability of expected future cash flows are cash flow hedges hedges that utilize derivatives or debt instruments to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with equity investments in nonusdollarfunctionalcurrency foreign subsidiaries net investment in a foreign operation are net investment hedges 

if certain hedging criteria specified in asc 815 are met including testing for hedge effectiveness hedge accounting may be applied the hedge effectiveness assessment methodologies for similar hedges are performed in a similar manner and are used consistently throughout the hedging relationships for fair value hedges changes in the value of the hedging derivative as well as changes in the value of the related hedged item due to the risk being hedged are reflected in current earnings for cash flow hedges and net investment hedges changes in the value of the hedging derivative are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  in citigroup’s stockholders’ equity to the extent the hedge is highly effective hedge ineffectiveness in either case is reflected in current earnings 

for assetliability management hedging fixedrate longterm debt is recorded at amortized cost under gaap however by designating an interest rate swap contract as a hedging instrument and electing to apply asc 815 fair value hedge accounting the carrying value of the debt is adjusted for changes in the benchmark interest rate with such changes in value recorded in current earnings the related interestrate swap also is recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with any changes in fair value also reflected in earnings thus any ineffectiveness resulting from the hedging relationship is captured in current earnings 

alternatively for management hedges that do not meet the asc 815 hedging criteria the derivative is recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with the associated changes in fair value recorded in earnings while the debt continues to be carried at amortized cost therefore current earnings are affected only by the interest rate shifts and other factors that cause a change in the swap’s value this type of hedge is undertaken when hedging requirements cannot be achieved or management decides not to apply asc 815 hedge accounting 

another alternative is to elect to carry the debt at fair value under the fair value option once the irrevocable election is made upon issuance of the debt the full change in fair value of the debt is reported in earnings the related interest rate swap with changes in fair value is also reflected in earnings which provides a natural offset to the debt’s fair value change to the extent the two offsets are not exactly equal because the full change in the fair value of the debt 

 

includes risks not offset by the interest rate swap the difference is captured in current earnings 

the key requirements to achieve asc 815 hedge accounting are documentation of a hedging strategy and specific hedge relationships at hedge inception and substantiating hedge effectiveness on an ongoing basis a derivative must be highly effective in accomplishing the hedge objective of offsetting either changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item for the risk being hedged any ineffectiveness in the hedge relationship is recognized in current earnings the assessment of effectiveness may exclude changes in the value of the hedged item that are unrelated to the risks being hedged similarly the assessment of effectiveness may exclude changes in the fair value of a derivative related to time value that if excluded are recognized in current earnings 

fair value hedges 

hedging of benchmark interest rate risk 

citigroup hedges exposure to changes in the fair value of outstanding fixedrate issued debt these hedges are designated as fair value hedges of the benchmark interest rate risk associated with the currency of the hedged liability the fixed cash flows of the hedged items are converted to benchmark variablerate cash flows by entering into receivefixed payvariable interest rate swaps these fair value hedge relationships use either regression or dollaroffset ratio analysis to assess whether the hedging relationships are highly effective at inception and on an ongoing basis 

citigroup also hedges exposure to changes in the fair value of fixedrate assets due to changes in benchmark interest rates including availableforsale debt securities and loans the hedging instruments used are receivevariable payfixed interest rate swaps these fair value hedging relationships use either regression or dollaroffset ratio analysis to assess whether the hedging relationships are highly effective at inception and on an ongoing basis 

hedging of foreign exchange risk 

citigroup hedges the change in fair value attributable to foreignexchange rate movements in availableforsale securities that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity holding the securities which may be within or outside the us the hedging instrument employed is generally a forward foreignexchange contract in this hedge the change in fair value of the hedged availableforsale security attributable to the portion of foreign exchange risk hedged is reported in earnings and not accumulated other comprehensive income loss —which serves to offset the change in fair value of the forward contract that is also reflected in earnings citigroup considers the premium associated with forward contracts ie the differential between spot and contractual forward rates as the cost of hedging this is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and reflected directly in earnings the dollaroffset method is used to assess hedge effectiveness since that assessment is based on changes in fair value attributable to changes in spot rates on both the availableforsale securities and the forward contracts for the portion of the relationship hedged the amount of hedge ineffectiveness is not significant 

the following table summarizes the gains losses on the company’s fair value hedges 



 246 

cash flow hedges 

hedging of benchmark interest rate risk 

citigroup hedges variable cash flows associated with floatingrate liabilities and the rollover reissuance of liabilities variable cash flows from those liabilities are converted to fixedrate cash flows by entering into receivevariable payfixed interest rate swaps and receivevariable payfixed forwardstarting interest rate swaps citi also hedges variable cash flows from recognized and forecasted floatingrate assets variable cash flows from those assets are converted to fixedrate cash flows by entering into receivefixed payvariable interest rate swaps these cashflow hedging relationships use either regression analysis or dollaroffset ratio analysis to assess whether the hedging relationships are highly effective at inception and on an ongoing basis when certain variable interest rates associated with hedged items do not qualify as benchmark interest rates citigroup designates the risk being hedged as the risk of overall changes in the hedged cash flows since efforts are made to match the terms of the derivatives to those of the hedged forecasted cash flows as closely as possible the amount of hedge ineffectiveness is not significant 

 

hedging of foreign exchange risk 

citigroup locks in the functional currency equivalent cash flows of longterm debt and shortterm borrowings that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the issuing entity depending on the risk management objectives these types of hedges are designated as either cash flow hedges of only foreign exchange risk or cash flow hedges of both foreign exchange and interest rate risk and the hedging instruments used are foreign exchange crosscurrency swaps and forward contracts these cash flow hedge relationships use dollaroffset ratio analysis to determine whether the hedging relationships are highly effective at inception and on an ongoing basis 

hedging total return 

citigroup generally manages the risk associated with leveraged loans it has originated or in which it participates by transferring a majority of its exposure to the market through spes prior to or shortly after funding retained exposures to 

leveraged loans receivable are generally hedged using total return swaps 

the amount of hedge ineffectiveness on the cash flow hedges recognized in earnings for the years ended   december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  is not significant the pretax change in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  from cash flow hedges is presented below 



 for cash flow hedges the changes in the fair value of the hedging derivative remaining in accumulated other comprehensive income loss on the consolidated balance sheet will be included in the earnings of future periods to offset the variability of the hedged cash flows when such cash flows affect earnings the net loss associated with cash flow hedges expected to be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income loss  within 12 months of december 31 2015  is approximately  03 billion  the maximum length of time over which forecasted cash flows are hedged is 10 years  

the aftertax impact of cash flow hedges on aoci is shown in note 20  to the consolidated financial statements 

 

net investment hedges 

consistent with asc 83020 foreign currency matters—foreign currency transactions  asc 815 allows hedging of the foreign currency risk of a net investment in a foreign operation citigroup uses foreign currency forwards options and foreigncurrencydenominated debt instruments to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with citigroup’s equity investments in several nonusdollarfunctionalcurrency foreign subsidiaries citigroup records the change in the carrying amount of these investments in the foreign currency translation adjustment  account within accumulated other comprehensive income loss  simultaneously the effective portion of the hedge of this exposure is also recorded in the foreign currency translation adjustment  account and the ineffective portion if any is immediately recorded in earnings 

for derivatives designated as net investment hedges citigroup follows the forwardrate method outlined in asc 815353516 through 3526 according to that method all changes in fair value including changes related to the forwardrate component of the foreign currency forward contracts and the time value of foreign currency options are recorded in the foreign currency translation adjustment  account within accumulated other comprehensive income loss  

for foreigncurrencydenominated debt instruments that are designated as hedges of net investments the translation gain or loss that is recorded in the foreign currency translation adjustment  account is based on the spot exchange rate between the functional currency of the respective subsidiary and the us dollar which is the functional currency of citigroup to the extent the notional amount of the hedging instrument exactly matches the hedged net investment and the underlying exchange rate of the derivative hedging instrument relates to the exchange rate between the functional currency of the net investment and citigroup’s functional currency or in the case of a nonderivative debt instrument such instrument is denominated in the functional currency of the net investment no  ineffectiveness is recorded in earnings 

the pretax gain loss recorded in the foreign currency translation adjustment  account within accumulated other comprehensive income loss  related to the effective portion of the net investment hedges is  2475 million   2890 million  and  2370 million  for the years ended   december 31 2015   2014  and 2013  respectively 

credit derivatives 

citi is a market maker and trades a range of credit derivatives through these contracts citi either purchases or writes protection on either a single name or a portfolio of reference credits citi also uses credit derivatives to help mitigate credit risk in its corporate and consumer loan portfolios and other cash positions and to facilitate client transactions 

citi monitors its counterparty credit risk in credit derivative contracts as of december 31 2015  and december 31 2014  approximately 98  of the gross receivables are from counterparties with which citi maintains collateral agreements a majority of citi’s top 15  counterparties by receivable balance owed to citi are banks financial institutions or other dealers contracts with these counterparties do not include ratingsbased termination events however counterparty ratings downgrades may have an incremental effect by lowering the threshold at which citi may 

call for additional collateral 

the range of credit derivatives entered into includes credit default swaps total return swaps credit options and creditlinked notes 

a credit default swap is a contract in which for a fee a protection seller agrees to reimburse a protection buyer for any losses that occur due to a predefined credit event on a reference entity these credit events are defined by the terms of the derivative contract and the reference credit and are generally limited to the market standard of failure to pay on indebtedness and bankruptcy of the reference credit and in a more limited range of transactions debt restructuring credit 

 

derivative transactions that reference emerging market entities will also typically include additional credit events to cover the acceleration of indebtedness and the risk of repudiation or a payment moratorium in certain transactions protection may be provided on a portfolio of reference entities or assetbacked securities if there is no credit event as defined by the specific derivative contract then the protection seller makes no payments to the protection buyer and receives only the contractually specified fee however if a credit event occurs as defined in the specific derivative contract sold the protection seller will be required to make a payment to the protection buyer under certain contracts the seller of protection may not be required to make a payment until a specified amount of losses has occurred with respect to the portfolio andor may only be required to pay for losses up to a specified amount 

a total return swap typically transfers the total economic performance of a reference asset which includes all associated cash flows as well as capital appreciation or depreciation the protection buyer receives a floating rate of interest and any depreciation on the reference asset from the protection seller and in return the protection seller receives the cash flows associated with the reference asset plus any appreciation thus according to the total return swap agreement the protection seller will be obligated to make a payment any time the floating interest rate payment plus any depreciation of the reference asset exceeds the cash flows associated with the underlying asset a total return swap may terminate upon a default of the reference asset or a credit event with respect to the reference entity subject to the provisions of the related total return swap agreement between the protection seller and the protection buyer 

a credit option is a credit derivative that allows investors to trade or hedge changes in the credit quality of a reference entity for example in a credit spread option the option writer assumes the obligation to purchase or sell credit protection on the reference entity at a specified “strike” spread level the option purchaser buys the right to sell credit default protection on the reference entity to or purchase it from the option writer at the strike spread level the payments on credit spread options depend either on a particular credit spread or the price of the underlying creditsensitive asset or other reference the options usually terminate if a credit event occurs with respect to the underlying reference entity 

a creditlinked note is a form of credit derivative structured as a debt security with an embedded credit default swap the purchaser of the note effectively provides credit protection to the issuer by agreeing to receive a return that could be negatively affected by credit events on the underlying reference credit if the reference entity defaults the note may be cash settled or physically settled by delivery of a debt security of the reference entity thus the maximum amount of the note purchaser’s exposure is the amount paid for the creditlinked note 

the following tables summarize the key characteristics of citi’s credit derivatives portfolio by counterparty and derivative form 



 



 

fair values included in the above tables are prior to application of any netting agreements and cash collateral for notional amounts citi generally has a mismatch between the total notional amounts of protection purchased and sold and it may hold the reference assets directly rather than entering into offsetting credit derivative contracts as and when desired the open risk exposures from credit derivative contracts are largely matched after certain cash positions in reference assets are considered and after notional amounts are adjusted either to a durationbased equivalent basis or to reflect the level of subordination in tranched structures the ratings of the credit derivatives portfolio presented in the tables and used to evaluate paymentperformance risk are based on the assigned internal or external ratings of the referenced asset or entity where external ratings are used investmentgrade ratings are considered to be ‘baabbb’ and above while anything below is considered noninvestment grade citi’s internal ratings are in line with the related external rating system 

citigroup evaluates the paymentperformance risk of the credit derivatives for which it stands as a protection seller based on the credit rating assigned to the underlying referenced credit credit derivatives written on an underlying noninvestment grade reference credit represent greater payment risk to the company the noninvestment grade category in the table above also includes credit derivatives where the underlying referenced entity has been downgraded subsequent to the inception of the derivative 

the maximum potential amount of future payments under credit derivative contracts presented in the table above is based on the notional value of the derivatives the company believes that the notional amount for credit protection sold is not representative of the actual loss exposure based on historical experience this amount has not been reduced by the value of the reference assets and the related cash flows in accordance with most credit derivative contracts should a credit event occur the company usually is liable for the difference between the protection sold and the value of the reference assets furthermore the notional amount for credit protection sold has not been reduced for any cash collateral paid to a given counterparty as such payments would be calculated after netting all derivative exposures including any credit derivatives with that counterparty in accordance with a related master netting agreement due to such netting processes determining the amount of collateral that corresponds to credit derivative exposures alone is not possible the company actively monitors open creditrisk exposures and manages this exposure by using a variety of strategies including purchased credit derivatives cash collateral or direct holdings of the referenced assets this risk mitigation activity is not captured in the table above 

creditriskrelated contingent features in derivatives 

certain derivative instruments contain provisions that require the company to either post additional collateral or immediately settle any outstanding liability balances upon the occurrence of a specified event related to the credit risk of the company these events which are defined by the existing derivative contracts are primarily downgrades in the credit ratings of the company and its affiliates the fair value excluding cva of all derivative instruments with creditriskrelated contingent features that were in a net liability position at both december 31 2015  and december 31 2014  was  22 billion  and  30 billion  respectively the company had posted  19 billion  and  27 billion  as collateral for this exposure in the normal course of business as of december 31 2015  and december 31 2014  respectively 

a downgrade could trigger additional collateral or cash settlement requirements for the company and certain affiliates in the event that citigroup and citibank were downgraded a single notch by all three  major rating agencies as of december 31 2015  the company could be required to post an additional  18 billion  as either collateral or settlement of the derivative transactions additionally the company could be required to segregate with thirdparty custodians collateral previously received from existing derivative counterparties in the amount of  01 billion  upon the single notch downgrade resulting in aggregate cash obligations and collateral requirements of approximately  19 billion  

derivatives accompanied by financial asset transfers 

the company executes total return swaps which provide it with synthetic exposure to substantially all of the economic return of the securities or other financial assets referenced in the contract in certain cases the derivative transaction is accompanied by the company’s transfer of the referenced financial asset to the derivative counterparty most typically in response to the derivative counterparty’s desire to hedge in whole or in part its synthetic exposure under the derivative contract by holding the referenced asset in funded form in certain jurisdictions these transactions qualify as sales resulting in derecognition of the securities transferred see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the related sale conditions for transfers of financial assets for a significant portion of the transactions the company has also executed another total return swap where the company passes on substantially all of the economic return of the referenced securities to a different third party seeking the exposure in those cases the company is not exposed on a net basis to changes in the economic return of the referenced securities 

these transactions generally involve the transfer of the company’s liquid government bonds convertible bonds or publicly traded corporate equity securities from the trading portfolio and are executed with thirdparty financial institutions the accompanying derivatives are typically total return swaps the derivatives are cash settled and subject to ongoing margin requirements 

when the conditions for sale accounting are met the company reports the transfer of the referenced financial asset as a sale and separately reports the accompanying derivative 

 

transaction these transactions generally do not result in a gain or loss on the sale of the security because the transferred security was held at fair value in the company’s trading portfolio for transfers of financial assets accounted for by the company as a sale where the company has retained substantially all of the economic exposure to the transferred asset through a total return swap executed in contemplation of the initial sale with the same counterparty and still outstanding as of december 31 2015  both the asset carrying amounts derecognized and gross cash proceeds received as of the date of derecognition were 10 billion  at december 31 2015  the fair value of these previously derecognized assets was 10 billion  and the fair value of the total return swaps was 7 million  recorded as gross derivative assets and 35 million  recorded as gross derivative liabilities the balances for the total return swaps are on a gross basis before the application of counterparty and cash collateral netting and are included primarily as equity derivatives in the tabular disclosures in this note 

24 concentrations of credit risk 

concentrations of credit risk exist when changes in economic industry or geographic factors similarly affect groups of counterparties whose aggregate credit exposure is material in relation to citigroup’s total credit exposure although citigroup’s portfolio of financial instruments is broadly diversified along industry product and geographic lines material transactions are completed with other financial institutions particularly in the securities trading derivatives and foreign exchange businesses 

in connection with the company’s efforts to maintain a diversified portfolio the company limits its exposure to any one geographic region country or individual creditor and monitors this exposure on a continuous basis at december 31 2015  citigroup’s most significant concentration of credit risk was with the us government and its agencies the company’s exposure which primarily results from trading assets and investments issued by the us government and its agencies amounted to 2230 billion  and 2163 billion  at december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively the mexican and united kingdom governments and their agencies which are rated investment grade by both moody’s and sp were the next largest exposures the company’s exposure to mexico amounted to 225 billion  and 297 billion  at december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively and was composed of investment securities loans and trading assets the company’s exposure to the united kingdom amounted to 204 billion  and 180 billion  at december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively and was composed of investment securities loans and trading assets 

the company’s exposure to states and municipalities amounted to 293 billion  and 310 billion  at december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively and was composed of trading assets investment securities derivatives and lending activities 

25 fair value measurement 

asc 82010 fair value measurement  defines fair value establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value and requires disclosures about fair value measurements fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date among other things the standard requires the company to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value 

under asc 82010 the probability of default of a counterparty is factored into the valuation of derivative and other positions as well as the impact of citigroup’s own credit risk on derivatives and other liabilities measured at fair value 

fair value hierarchy 

asc 82010 specifies a hierarchy of inputs based on whether the inputs are observable or unobservable observable inputs are developed using market data and reflect market participant assumptions while unobservable inputs reflect the company’s market assumptions these two types of inputs have created the following fair value hierarchy 

 

as required under the fair value hierarchy the company considers relevant and observable market inputs in its valuations where possible the frequency of transactions the size of the bidask spread and the amount of adjustment necessary when comparing similar transactions are all factors in determining the liquidity of markets and the relevance of observed prices in those markets 

the company’s policy with respect to transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy is to recognize transfers into and out of each level as of the end of the reporting period 

determination of fair value 

for assets and liabilities carried at fair value the company measures fair value using the procedures set out below irrespective of whether the assets and liabilities are measured at fair value as a result of an election or whether they are required to be measured at fair value 

when available the company uses quoted market prices to determine fair value and classifies such items as level 1 in some cases where a market price is available the 

 

company will make use of acceptable practical expedients such as matrix pricing to calculate fair value in which case the items are classified as level 2 

the company may also apply a pricebased methodology which utilizes where available quoted prices or other market information obtained from recent trading activity in positions with the same or similar characteristics to the position being valued the market activity and the amount of the bidask spread are among the factors considered in determining the liquidity of markets and the observability of prices from those markets if relevant and observable prices are available those valuations may be classified as level 2 when less liquidity exists for a security or loan a quoted price is stale a significant adjustment to the price of a similar security is necessary to reflect differences in the terms of the actual security or loan being valued or prices from independent sources are insufficient to corroborate the valuation the “price” inputs are considered unobservable and the fair value measurements are classified as level 3 

if quoted market prices are not available fair value is based upon internally developed valuation techniques that use where possible current marketbased parameters such as interest rates currency rates and option volatilities items valued using such internally generated valuation techniques are classified according to the lowest level input or value driver that is significant to the valuation thus an item may be classified as level 3 even though there may be some significant inputs that are readily observable 

fair value estimates from internal valuation techniques are verified where possible to prices obtained from independent vendors or brokers vendors’ and brokers’ valuations may be based on a variety of inputs ranging from observed prices to proprietary valuation models 

the following section describes the valuation methodologies used by the company to measure various financial instruments at fair value including an indication of the level in the fair value hierarchy in which each instrument is generally classified where appropriate the description includes details of the valuation models the key inputs to those models and any significant assumptions 

market valuation adjustments 

generally the unit of account for a financial instrument is the individual financial instrument the company applies market valuation adjustments that are consistent with the unit of account which does not include adjustment due to the size of the company’s position except as follows asc 82010 permits an exception through an accounting policy election to measure the fair value of a portfolio of financial assets and financial liabilities on the basis of the net open risk position when certain criteria are met citi has elected to measure certain portfolios of financial instruments such as derivatives that meet those criteria on the basis of the net open risk position the company applies market valuation adjustments including adjustments to account for the size of the net open risk position consistent with market participant assumptions and in accordance with the unit of account 

liquidity adjustments are applied to items in level 2 or level 3 of the fairvalue hierarchy in an effort to ensure that the fair value reflects the price at which the net open risk position could be liquidated the liquidity adjustment is based on the bidoffer spread for an instrument when citi has elected to measure certain portfolios of financial investments such as derivatives on the basis of the net open risk position the liquidity adjustment may be adjusted to take into account the size of the position 

credit valuation adjustments cva and effective in the third quarter of 2014 funding valuation adjustments fva are applied to overthecounter otc derivative instruments in which the base valuation generally discounts expected cash flows using the relevant base interest rate curve for the currency of the derivative eg libor for uncollateralized usdollar derivatives as not all counterparties have the same credit risk as that implied by the relevant base curve a cva is necessary to incorporate the market view of both counterparty credit risk and citi’s own credit risk in the valuation fva reflects a market funding risk premium inherent in the uncollateralized portion of derivative portfolios and in collateralized derivatives where the terms of the agreement do not permit the reuse of the collateral received 

citi’s cva and fva methodology is composed of two steps 



 

the cva and fva are designed to incorporate a market view of the credit and funding risk respectively inherent in the derivative portfolio however most unsecured derivative instruments are negotiated bilateral contracts and are not commonly transferred to third parties derivative instruments are normally settled contractually or if terminated early are terminated at a value negotiated bilaterally between the counterparties thus the cva and fva may not be realized upon a settlement or termination in the normal course of business in addition all or a portion of these adjustments may be reversed or otherwise adjusted in future periods in the event of changes in the credit or funding risk associated with the derivative instruments 

the table below summarizes the cva and fva applied to the fair value of derivative instruments at december 31 2015 and 2014 



 

the table below summarizes pretax gains losses related to changes in cva on derivative instruments net of hedges fva on derivatives and debt valuation adjustments dva on citi’s own fair value option fvo liabilities for the years indicated 



 

valuation process for fair value measurements 

price verification procedures and related internal control procedures are governed by the citigroup pricing and price verification policy and standards  which is jointly owned by finance and risk management 

for fair value measurements of substantially all assets and liabilities held by the company individual business units are responsible for valuing the trading account assets and liabilities and product control within finance performs independent price verification procedures to evaluate those fair value measurements product control is independent of the individual business units and reports to the global head of product control it has authority over the valuation of financial assets and liabilities fair value measurements of assets and liabilities are determined using various techniques including but not limited to discounted cash flows and internal models such as option and correlation models 

based on the observability of inputs used product control classifies the inventory as level 1 level 2 or level 3 of the fair value hierarchy when a position involves one or more significant inputs that are not directly observable price verification procedures are performed that may include reviewing relevant historical data analyzing profit and loss valuing each component of a structured trade individually and benchmarking among others 

reports of inventory that is classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are distributed to senior management in finance risk and the business this inventory is also discussed in risk committees and in monthly meetings with senior trading management as deemed necessary reports may go to the audit committee of the board of directors or to the full board of directors whenever an adjustment is needed to bring the price of an asset or liability to its exit price product control reports it to management along with other price verification results 

in addition the pricing models used in measuring fair value are governed by an independent control framework although the models are developed and tested by the individual business units they are independently validated by the model validation group within risk management and reviewed by finance with respect to their impact on the price verification procedures the purpose of this independent control framework is to assess model risk arising from models’ theoretical soundness calibration techniques where needed and the appropriateness of the model for a specific product in a defined market to ensure their continued applicability models are independently reviewed annually in addition risk management approves and maintains a list of products permitted to be valued under each approved model for a given business 

securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under agreements to repurchase 

no quoted prices exist for these instruments so fair value is determined using a discounted cashflow technique cash flows are estimated based on the terms of the contract taking into account any embedded derivative or other features these cash flows are discounted using interest rates appropriate to the maturity of the instrument as well as the nature of the underlying collateral generally when such instruments are recorded at fair value they are classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as the inputs used in the valuation are readily observable however certain 

 

longdated positions are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy 

trading account assets and liabilities—trading securities and trading loans 

when available the company uses quoted market prices in active markets to determine the fair value of trading securities such items are classified as level 1 of the fair value hierarchy examples include government securities and exchangetraded equity securities 

for bonds and secondary market loans traded over the counter the company generally determines fair value utilizing valuation techniques including discounted cash flows pricebased and internal models such as blackscholes and monte carlo simulation fair value estimates from these internal valuation techniques are verified where possible to prices obtained from independent sources including thirdparty vendors vendors compile prices from various sources and may apply matrix pricing for similar bonds or loans where no price is observable a pricebased methodology utilizes where available quoted prices or other market information obtained from recent trading activity of assets with similar characteristics to the bond or loan being valued the yields used in discounted cash flow models are derived from the same price information trading securities and loans priced using such methods are generally classified as level 2 however when less liquidity exists for a security or loan a quoted price is stale a significant adjustment to the price of a similar security or loan is necessary to reflect differences in the terms of the actual security or loan being valued or prices from independent sources are insufficient to corroborate valuation a loan or security is generally classified as level 3 the price input used in a pricebased methodology may be zero for a security such as a subprime cdo that is not receiving any principal or interest and is currently written down to zero 

when the company’s principal market for a portfolio of loans is the securitization market the company uses the securitization price to determine the fair value of the portfolio the securitization price is determined from the assumed proceeds of a hypothetical securitization in the current market adjusted for transformation costs ie direct costs other than transaction costs and securitization uncertainties such as market conditions and liquidity as a result of the severe reduction in the level of activity in certain securitization markets since the second half of 2007 observable securitization prices for certain directly comparable portfolios of loans have not been readily available therefore such portfolios of loans are generally classified as level 3 of the fair value hierarchy however for other loan securitization markets such as commercial real estate loans price verification of the hypothetical securitizations has been possible since these markets have remained active accordingly this loan portfolio is classified as level 2 of the fair value hierarchy 

for most of the lending and structured direct subprime exposures fair value is determined utilizing observable transactions where available other market data for similar assets in markets that are not active and other internal 

valuation techniques the valuation of certain assetbacked security abs cdo positions utilizes prices based on the underlying assets of the abs cdo 

trading account assets and liabilities—derivatives 

exchangetraded derivatives measured at fair value using quoted ie exchange prices in active markets where available are classified as level 1 of the fair value hierarchy 

derivatives without a quoted price in an active market and derivatives executed over the counter are valued using internal valuation techniques these derivative instruments are classified as either level 2 or level 3 depending upon the observability of the significant inputs to the model 

the valuation techniques and inputs depend on the type of derivative and the nature of the underlying instrument the principal techniques used to value these instruments are discounted cash flows and internal models including blackscholes and monte carlo simulation 

the key inputs depend upon the type of derivative and the nature of the underlying instrument and include interest rate yield curves foreignexchange rates volatilities and correlation the company uses overnight indexed swap ois curves as fair value measurement inputs for the valuation of certain collateralized derivatives citi uses the relevant benchmark curve for the currency of the derivative eg the london interbank offered rate for us dollar derivatives as the discount rate for uncollateralized derivatives 

as referenced above during the third  quarter of 2014  citi incorporated fva into the fair value measurements due to what it believes to be an industry migration toward incorporating the market’s view of funding risk premium in otc derivatives the charge incurred in connection with the implementation of fva was reflected in principal transactions  as a change in accounting estimate citi’s fva methodology leverages the existing cva methodology to estimate a funding exposure profile the calculation of this exposure profile considers collateral agreements where the terms do not permit the firm to reuse the collateral received including where counterparties post collateral to thirdparty custodians 

investments 

the investments category includes availableforsale debt and marketable equity securities whose fair values are generally determined by utilizing similar procedures described for trading securities above or in some cases using vendor pricing as the primary source 

also included in investments are nonpublic investments in private equity and real estate entities determining the fair value of nonpublic securities involves a significant degree of management judgment as no quoted prices exist and such securities are generally thinly traded in addition there may be transfer restrictions on private equity securities the company’s process for determining the fair value of such securities utilizes commonly accepted valuation techniques including comparables analysis in determining the fair value of nonpublic securities the company also considers events 

 

such as a proposed sale of the investee company initial public offerings equity issuances or other observable transactions 

private equity securities are generally classified as level 3 of the fair value hierarchy 

in addition the company holds investments in certain alternative investment funds that calculate nav per share including hedge funds private equity funds and real estate funds investments in funds are generally classified as nonmarketable equity securities carried at fair value the fair values of these investments are estimated using the nav per share of the company’s ownership interest in the funds where it is not probable that the investment will be realized at a price other than the nav consistent with the provisions of asu no 201507 these investments have not been categorized within the fair value hierarchy and are not included in the tables below see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

shortterm borrowings and longterm debt 

where fair value accounting has been elected the fair value of nonstructured liabilities is determined by utilizing internal models using the appropriate discount rate for the applicable maturity such instruments are generally classified as level 2 of the fair value hierarchy when all significant inputs are readily observable 

the company determines the fair value of hybrid financial instruments including structured liabilities using the appropriate derivative valuation methodology described above in “trading account assets and liabilities—derivatives” given the nature of the embedded risk profile such instruments are classified as level 2 or level 3 depending on the observability of significant inputs to the model 

alta mortgage securities 

the company classifies its alta mortgage securities as heldtomaturity availableforsale or trading investments the securities classified as trading and availableforsale are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value reported in current earnings and aoci respectively for these purposes citi defines alta mortgage securities as nonagency residential mortgagebacked securities rmbs where i the underlying collateral has weighted average fico scores between 680  and 720  or ii for instances where fico scores are greater than 720 rmbs have 30  or less of the underlying collateral composed of full documentation loans 

similar to the valuation methodologies used for other trading securities and trading loans the company generally determines the fair values of alta mortgage securities utilizing internal valuation techniques fair value estimates from internal valuation techniques are verified where possible to prices obtained from independent vendors consensus data providers compile prices from various sources where available the company may also make use of quoted prices for recent trading activity in securities with the same or similar characteristics to the security being valued 

the valuation techniques used for alta mortgage securities as with other mortgage exposures are pricebased and yield analysis the primary marketderived input is yield cash flows are based on current collateral performance with prepayment rates and loss projections reflective of current economic conditions of housing price change unemployment rates interest rates borrower attributes and other market indicators 

alta mortgage securities that are valued using these methods are generally classified as level 2 however alta mortgage securities backed by alta mortgages of lower quality or subordinated tranches in the capital structure are mostly classified as level 3 due to the reduced liquidity that exists for such positions which reduces the reliability of prices available from independent sources 

items measured at fair value on a recurring basis 

the following tables present for each of the fair value hierarchy levels the company’s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis at december 31 2015  and december 31 2014  the company’s hedging of positions that have been classified in the level 3 category is not limited to other financial instruments hedging 

 

instruments that have been classified as level 3 but also instruments classified as level 1 or level 2 of the fair value hierarchy the effects of these hedges are presented gross in the following tables

changes in level 3 fair value category 

the following tables present the changes in the level 3 fair value category for the years ended   december 31 2015  and 2014  as discussed above the company classifies financial instruments as level 3 of the fair value hierarchy when there is reliance on at least one significant unobservable input to the valuation model in addition to these unobservable inputs the valuation models for level 3 financial instruments typically also rely on a number of inputs that are readily observable either directly or indirectly the gains and losses presented below include changes in the fair value related to both observable and unobservable inputs 

 

the company often hedges positions with offsetting positions that are classified in a different level for example the gains and losses for assets and liabilities in the level 3 category presented in the tables below do not reflect the effect of offsetting losses and gains on hedging instruments that have been classified by the company in the level 1 and level 2 categories in addition the company hedges items classified in the level 3 category with instruments also classified in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy the effects of these hedges are presented gross in the following tables

valuation techniques and inputs for level 3 fair value measurements 

the company’s level 3 inventory consists of both cash securities and derivatives of varying complexity the valuation methodologies used to measure the fair value of these positions include discounted cash flow analysis internal models and comparative analysis a position is classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy when at least one input is unobservable and is considered significant to its valuation the specific reason an input is deemed unobservable varies for example at least one significant input to the pricing model is not observable in the market at least one significant input has been adjusted to make it more representative of the position being valued or the price quote available does not reflect sufficient trading activities 

 

the following tables present the valuation techniques covering the majority of level 3 inventory and the most significant unobservable inputs used in level 3 fair value measurements differences between this table and amounts presented in the level 3 fair value rollforward table represent individually immaterial items that have been measured using a variety of valuation techniques other than those listed 

valuation techniques and inputs for level 3 fair value measurements 









 

sensitivity to unobservable inputs and interrelationships between unobservable inputs 

the impact of key unobservable inputs on the level 3 fair value measurements may not be independent of one another in addition the amount and direction of the impact on a fair value measurement for a given change in an unobservable input depends on the nature of the instrument as well as whether the company holds the instrument as an asset or a liability for certain instruments the pricing hedging and risk management are sensitive to the correlation between various inputs rather than on the analysis and aggregation of the individual inputs 

the following section describes the sensitivities and interrelationships of the most significant unobservable inputs used by the company in level 3 fair value measurements 

correlation 

correlation is a measure of the extent to which two or more variables change in relation to each other a variety of correlationrelated assumptions are required for a wide range of instruments including equity and credit baskets foreignexchange options cdos backed by loans or bonds mortgages subprime mortgages and many other instruments for almost all of these instruments correlations are not observable in the market and must be calculated using historical information estimating correlation can be especially difficult where it may vary over time calculating correlation information from market data requires significant assumptions regarding the informational efficiency of the market for example swaption markets changes in correlation levels can have a major impact favorable or unfavorable on the value of an instrument depending on its nature a change in the default correlation of the fair value of the underlying bonds comprising a cdo structure would affect the fair value of the senior tranche for example an increase in the default correlation of the underlying bonds would reduce the fair value of the senior tranche because highly correlated instruments produce larger losses in the event of default and a part of these losses would become attributable to the senior tranche that same change in default correlation would have a different impact on junior tranches of the same structure 

volatility 

volatility represents the speed and severity of market price changes and is a key factor in pricing options typically instruments can become more expensive if volatility increases for example as an index becomes more volatile the cost to citi of maintaining a given level of exposure increases because more frequent rebalancing of the portfolio is required volatility generally depends on the tenor of the underlying instrument and the strike price or level defined in the contract volatilities for certain combinations of tenor and strike are not observable the general relationship between changes in the value of a portfolio to changes in volatility also depends on changes in interest rates and the level of the underlying index generally long option positions assets benefit from increases in volatility whereas short option positions liabilities will suffer losses some instruments are more sensitive to changes in volatility than others for example an 

 

atthemoney option would experience a larger percentage change in its fair value than a deepinthemoney option in addition the fair value of an option with more than one underlying security for example an option on a basket of bonds depends on the volatility of the individual underlying securities as well as their correlations 

yield 

adjusted yield is generally used to discount the projected future principal and interest cash flows on instruments such as assetbacked securities adjusted yield is impacted by changes in the interest rate environment and relevant credit spreads 

in some circumstances the yield of an instrument is not observable in the market and must be estimated from historical data or from yields of similar securities this estimated yield may need to be adjusted to capture the characteristics of the security being valued in other situations the estimated yield may not represent sufficient market liquidity and must be adjusted as well whenever the amount of the adjustment is significant to the value of the security the fair value measurement is classified as level 3 

prepayment 

voluntary unscheduled payments prepayments change the future cash flows for the investor and thereby change the fair value of the security the effect of prepayments is more pronounced for residential mortgagebacked securities an increase in prepayments—in speed or magnitude—generally creates losses for the holder of these securities prepayment is generally negatively correlated with delinquency and interest rate a combination of low prepayment and high delinquencies amplify each input’s negative impact on mortgage securities’ valuation as prepayment speeds change the weighted average life of the security changes which impacts the valuation either positively or negatively depending upon the nature of the security and the direction of the change in the weighted average life 

recovery 

recovery is the proportion of the total outstanding balance of a bond or loan that is expected to be collected in a liquidation scenario for many credit securities such as assetbacked securities there is no directly observable market input for recovery but indications of recovery levels are available from pricing services the assumed recovery of a security may differ from its actual recovery that will be observable in the future the recovery rate impacts the valuation of credit securities generally an increase in the recovery rate assumption increases the fair value of the security an increase in loss severity the inverse of the recovery rate reduces the amount of principal available for distribution and as a result decreases the fair value of the security 

credit spread 

credit spread is a component of the security representing its credit quality credit spread reflects the market perception of changes in prepayment delinquency and recovery rates therefore capturing the impact of other variables on the fair value changes in credit spread affect the fair value of 

securities differently depending on the characteristics and maturity profile of the security for example credit spread is a more significant driver of the fair value measurement of a high yield bond as compared to an investment grade bond generally the credit spread for an investment grade bond is also more observable and less volatile than its high yield counterpart 

qualitative discussion of the ranges of significant unobservable inputs 

the following section describes the ranges of the most significant unobservable inputs used by the company in level 3 fair value measurements the level of aggregation and the diversity of instruments held by the company lead to a wide range of unobservable inputs that may not be evenly distributed across the level 3 inventory 

correlation 

there are many different types of correlation inputs including credit correlation crossasset correlation such as equityinterest rate correlation and sameasset correlation such as interest rateinterest rate correlation correlation inputs are generally used to value hybrid and exotic instruments generally sameasset correlation inputs have a narrower range than crossasset correlation inputs however due to the complex and unique nature of these instruments the ranges for correlation inputs can vary widely across portfolios 

volatility 

similar to correlation assetspecific volatility inputs vary widely by asset type for example ranges for foreign exchange volatility are generally lower and narrower than equity volatility equity volatilities are wider due to the nature of the equities market and the terms of certain exotic instruments for most instruments the interest rate volatility input is on the lower end of the range however for certain structured or exotic instruments such as marketlinked deposits or exotic interest rate derivatives the range is much wider

ranges for the yield inputs vary significantly depending upon the type of security for example securities that typically have lower yields such as municipal bonds will fall on the lower end of the range while more illiquid securities or securities with lower credit quality such as certain residual tranche assetbacked securities will have much higher yield inputs 

credit spread 

credit spread is relevant primarily for fixed income and credit instruments however the ranges for the credit spread input can vary across instruments for example certain fixed income instruments such as certificates of deposit typically have lower credit spreads whereas certain derivative instruments with highrisk counterparties are typically subject to higher credit spreads when they are uncollateralized or have a longer tenor other instruments such as credit default swaps also have credit spreads that vary with the attributes of the 

 

underlying obligor stronger companies have tighter credit spreads and weaker companies have wider credit spreads 

price 

the price input is a significant unobservable input for certain fixed income instruments for these instruments the price input is expressed as a percentage of the notional amount with a price of 100 meaning that the instrument is valued at par for most of these instruments the price varies between zero to 100 or slightly above 100 relatively illiquid assets that have experienced significant losses since issuance such as certain assetbacked securities are at the lower end of the range whereas most investment grade corporate bonds will fall in the middle to the higher end of the range for certain structured debt instruments with embedded derivatives the price input may be above 100  to reflect the embedded features of the instrument for example a stepup coupon or a conversion option 

the price input is also a significant unobservable input for certain equity securities however the range of price inputs varies depending on the nature of the position the number of shares outstanding and other factors 

mean reversion 

a number of financial instruments require an estimate of the rate at which the interest rate reverts to its long term average changes in this estimate can significantly affect the fair value of these instruments however sometimes there is insufficient external market data to calibrate this parameter especially when pricing more complex instruments the level of mean reversion affects the correlation between short and long term interest rates the fair values of more complex instruments such as bermudan swaptions options with multiple exercise dates and constant maturity spread options or structured debts with these embedded features are more sensitive to the changes in this correlation as compared to less complex instruments such as caps and floors 

items measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis 

certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and therefore are not included in the tables above these include assets measured at cost that have been written down to fair value during the periods as a result of an impairment in addition these assets include loans heldforsale and other real estate owned that are measured at the lower of cost or market 

the following table presents the carrying amounts of all assets that were still held for which a nonrecurring fair value measurement was recorded 





 

 

the fair value of loansheldforsale is determined where possible using quoted secondarymarket prices if no such quoted price exists the fair value of a loan is determined using quoted prices for a similar asset or assets adjusted for the specific attributes of that loan fair value for the other real estate owned is based on appraisals for loans whose carrying amount is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral the fair values depend on the type of collateral fair value of the collateral is typically estimated based on quoted market prices if available appraisals or other internal valuation techniques 

where the fair value of the related collateral is based on an unadjusted appraised value the loan is generally classified as level 2 where significant adjustments are made to the appraised value the loan is classified as level 3 additionally for corporate loans appraisals of the collateral are often based on sales of similar assets however because the prices of similar assets require significant adjustments to reflect the unique features of the underlying collateral these fair value measurements are generally classified as level 3 

valuation techniques and inputs for level 3 nonrecurring fair value measurements 

the following tables present the valuation techniques covering the majority of level 3 nonrecurring fair value measurements and the most significant unobservable inputs used in those measurements 



 



 

nonrecurring fair value changes 

the following table presents total nonrecurring fair value measurements for the period included in earnings attributable to the change in fair value relating to assets that were still held 



 





estimated fair value of financial instruments not carried at fair value 

the table below presents the carrying value and fair value of citigroup’s financial instruments that are not carried at fair value the table below therefore excludes items measured at fair value on a recurring basis presented in the tables above 

the disclosure also excludes leases affiliate investments pension and benefit obligations and insurance policy claim reserves in addition contractholder fund amounts exclude certain insurance contracts also as required the disclosure excludes the effect of taxes any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the entire holdings of a particular instrument excess fair value associated with deposits with no fixed maturity and other expenses that would be incurred in a market transaction in addition the table excludes the values of nonfinancial assets and liabilities as well as a wide range of franchise relationship and intangible values which are integral to a full assessment of citigroup’s financial position and the value of its net assets 

the fair value represents management’s best estimates based on a range of methodologies and assumptions the 

 

carrying value of shortterm financial instruments not accounted for at fair value as well as receivables and payables arising in the ordinary course of business approximates fair value because of the relatively short period of time between their origination and expected realization quoted market prices are used when available for investments and for liabilities such as longterm debt not carried at fair value for loans not accounted for at fair value cash flows are discounted at quoted secondary market rates or estimated market rates if available otherwise sales of comparable loan portfolios or current market origination rates for loans with similar terms and risk characteristics are used expected credit losses are either embedded in the estimated future cash flows or incorporated as an adjustment to the discount rate used the value of collateral is also considered for liabilities such as longterm debt not accounted for at fair value and without quoted market prices market borrowing rates of interest are used to discount contractual cash flows 





 

fair values vary from period to period based on changes in a wide range of factors including interest rates credit quality and market perceptions of value and as existing assets and liabilities run off and new transactions are entered into the estimated fair values of loans reflect changes in credit status since the loans were made changes in interest rates in the case of fixedrate loans and premium values at origination of certain loans 

the estimated fair values of the company’s corporate unfunded lending commitments at december 31 2015  and december 31 2014  were liabilities of 70 billion  and 55 billion  respectively substantially all of which are classified as level 3 the company does not estimate the fair values of consumer unfunded lending commitments which are generally cancellable by providing notice to the borrower 

26 fair value elections 

the company may elect to report most financial instruments and certain other items at fair value on an instrumentbyinstrument basis with changes in fair value reported in earnings the election is made upon the initial recognition of an eligible financial asset financial liability or firm commitment or when certain specified reconsideration events occur the fair value election may not be revoked once an election is made the changes in fair value are recorded in 

 

current earnings additional discussion regarding the applicable areas in which fair value elections were made is presented in note 25  to the consolidated financial statements 

all servicing rights are recognized initially at fair value the company has elected fair value accounting for its mortgage servicing rights see note 22  to the consolidated financial statements for further discussions regarding the accounting and reporting of msrs 

the following table presents the changes in fair value gains and losses associated with those items for which the fair value option was elected 

 276 

own debt valuation adjustments 

own debt valuation adjustments are recognized on citi’s liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected using citi’s credit spreads observed in the bond market the fair value of liabilities for which the fair value option is elected other than nonrecourse and similar liabilities is impacted by the narrowing or widening of the company’s credit spreads the estimated change in the fair value of these liabilities due to such changes in the company’s own credit risk or instrumentspecific credit risk was a gain of  367 million  and  218 million  for the years ended december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively changes in fair value resulting from changes in instrumentspecific credit risk were estimated by incorporating the company’s current credit spreads observable in the bond market into the relevant valuation technique used to value each liability as described above 

the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities

certain loans and other credit products 

citigroup has elected the fair value option for certain originated and purchased loans including certain unfunded loan products such as guarantees and letters of credit executed by citigroup’s lending and trading businesses none of these credit products are highly leveraged financing commitments significant groups of transactions include loans and unfunded loan products that are expected to be either sold or securitized in the near term or transactions where the economic risks are hedged with derivative instruments such as purchased credit default swaps or total return swaps where the company pays the total return on the underlying loans to a third party citigroup has elected the fair value option to mitigate accounting mismatches in cases where hedge accounting is complex and to achieve operational simplifications fair value was not elected for most lending transactions across the company 

the following table provides information about certain credit products carried at fair value 



in addition to the amounts reported above  2113 million  and  2335 million  of unfunded commitments related to certain credit products selected for fair value accounting were outstanding as of december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively 

 

changes in the fair value of funded and unfunded credit products are classified in principal transactions  in the company’s consolidated statement of income related interest revenue is measured based on the contractual interest rates and reported as interest revenue  on trading account assets  or loan interest depending on the balance sheet classifications of the credit products the changes in fair value for the years ended december 31 2015  and 2014  due to instrumentspecific credit risk totaled to a loss of  221 million  and  155 million  respectively

certain structured liabilities 

the company has elected the fair value option for certain structured liabilities whose performance is linked to structured interest rates inflation currency equity referenced credit or commodity risks the company elected the fair value option because these exposures are considered to be tradingrelated positions and therefore are managed on a fair value basis these positions will continue to be classified as debt deposits or derivatives  trading account liabilities  on the company’s consolidated balance sheet according to their legal form

guarantees 

citi provides a variety of guarantees and indemnifications to its customers to enhance their credit standing and enable them to complete a wide variety of business transactions for 

certain contracts meeting the definition of a guarantee the guarantor must recognize at inception a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 

in addition the guarantor must disclose the maximum potential amount of future payments that the guarantor could be required to make under the guarantee if there were a total 

default by the guaranteed parties the determination of the maximum potential future payments is based on the notional amount of the guarantees without consideration of possible recoveries under recourse provisions or from collateral held or pledged as such citi believes such amounts bear no relationship to the anticipated losses if any on these guarantees 

the following tables present information about citi’s guarantees 





 

financial standby letters of credit 

citi issues standby letters of credit which substitute its own credit for that of the borrower if a letter of credit is drawn down the borrower is obligated to repay citi standby letters of credit protect a third party from defaults on contractual obligations financial standby letters of credit include i guarantees of payment of insurance premiums and reinsurance risks that support industrial revenue bond underwriting ii settlement of payment obligations to clearing houses including futures and overthecounter derivatives clearing see further discussion below iii support options and purchases of securities in lieu of escrow deposit accounts and iv letters of credit that backstop loans credit facilities promissory notes and trade acceptances 

performance guarantees 

performance guarantees and letters of credit are issued to guarantee a customer’s tender bid on a construction or systemsinstallation project or to guarantee completion of such projects in accordance with contract terms they are also issued to support a customer’s obligation to supply specified products commodities or maintenance or warranty services to a third party 

derivative instruments considered to be guarantees 

derivatives are financial instruments whose cash flows are based on a notional amount and an underlying instrument reference credit or index where there is little or no initial investment and whose terms require or permit net settlement for a discussion of citi’s derivatives activities see note 23 to the consolidated financial statements 

derivative instruments considered to be guarantees include only those instruments that require citi to make payments to the counterparty based on changes in an underlying instrument that is related to an asset a liability or an equity security held by the guaranteed party more specifically derivative instruments considered to be guarantees include certain overthecounter written put options where the counterparty is not a bank hedge fund or brokerdealer such counterparties are considered to be dealers in these markets and may therefore not hold the underlying 

 

instruments credit derivatives sold by citi are excluded from the tables above as they are disclosed separately in note 23 to the consolidated financial statements in instances where citi’s maximum potential future payment is unlimited the notional amount of the contract is disclosed 

loans sold with recourse 

loans sold with recourse represent citi’s obligations to reimburse the buyers for loan losses under certain circumstances recourse refers to the clause in a sales agreement under which a sellerlender will fully reimburse the buyerinvestor for any losses resulting from the purchased loans this may be accomplished by the seller taking back any loans that become delinquent 

in addition to the amounts shown in the tables above citi has recorded a repurchase reserve for its potential repurchases or makewhole liability regarding residential mortgage representation and warranty claims related to its whole loan sales to the us governmentsponsored enterprises gses and to a lesser extent private investors the repurchase reserve was approximately 152 million  and 224 million  at december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively and these amounts are included in other liabilities  on the consolidated balance sheet 

securities lending indemnifications 

owners of securities frequently lend those securities for a fee to other parties who may sell them short or deliver them to another party to satisfy some other obligation banks may administer such securities lending programs for their clients securities lending indemnifications are issued by the bank to guarantee that a securities lending customer will be made whole in the event that the security borrower does not return the security subject to the lending agreement and collateral held is insufficient to cover the market value of the security 

credit card merchant processing 

credit card merchant processing guarantees represent the company’s indirect obligations in connection with i providing transaction processing services to various merchants with respect to its privatelabel cards and 

ii potential liability for bank card transaction processing services the nature of the liability in either case arises as a result of a billing dispute between a merchant and a cardholder that is ultimately resolved in the cardholder’s favor the merchant is liable to refund the amount to the cardholder in general if the credit card processing company is unable to collect this amount from the merchant the credit card processing company bears the loss for the amount of the credit or refund paid to the cardholder 

with regard to i above citi has the primary contingent liability with respect to its portfolio of privatelabel merchants the risk of loss is mitigated as the cash flows between citi and the merchant are settled on a net basis and citi has the right to offset any payments with cash flows otherwise due to the merchant to further mitigate this risk citi may delay settlement require a merchant to make an escrow deposit include event triggers to provide citi with more financial and operational control in the event of the financial deterioration of the merchant or require various credit enhancements including letters of credit and bank guarantees in the unlikely event that a privatelabel merchant is unable to deliver products services or a refund to its privatelabel cardholders citi is contingently liable to credit or refund cardholders 

with regard to ii above citi has a potential liability for bank card transactions where citi provides the transaction processing services as well as those where a third party provides the services and citi acts as a secondary guarantor should that processor fail to perform 

citi’s maximum potential contingent liability related to both bank card and privatelabel merchant processing services is estimated to be the total volume of credit card transactions that meet the requirements to be valid chargeback transactions at any given time at december 31 2015  and 2014  this maximum potential exposure was estimated to be 84 billion  and 86 billion  respectively 

however citi believes that the maximum exposure is not representative of the actual potential loss exposure based on its historical experience this contingent liability is unlikely to arise as most products and services are delivered when purchased and amounts are refunded when items are returned to merchants citi assesses the probability and amount of its contingent liability related to merchant processing based on the financial strength of the primary guarantor the extent and nature of unresolved chargebacks and its historical loss experience at december 31 2015  and 2014  the losses incurred and the carrying amounts of citi’s contingent obligations related to merchant processing activities were immaterial 

custody indemnifications 

custody indemnifications are issued to guarantee that custody clients will be made whole in the event that a thirdparty subcustodian or depository institution fails to safeguard clients’ assets 

 

other guarantees and indemnifications 

credit card protection programs 

citi through its credit card businesses provides various cardholder protection programs on several of its card products including programs that provide insurance coverage for rental cars coverage for certain losses associated with purchased products price protection for certain purchases and protection for lost luggage these guarantees are not included in the table since the total outstanding amount of the guarantees and citi’s maximum exposure to loss cannot be quantified the protection is limited to certain types of purchases and losses and it is not possible to quantify the purchases that would qualify for these benefits at any given time citi assesses the probability and amount of its potential liability related to these programs based on the extent and nature of its historical loss experience at december 31 2015  and 2014  the actual and estimated losses incurred and the carrying value of citi’s obligations related to these programs were immaterial 

other representation and warranty indemnifications 

in the normal course of business citi provides standard representations and warranties to counterparties in contracts in connection with numerous transactions and also provides indemnifications including indemnifications that protect the counterparties to the contracts in the event that additional taxes are owed due either to a change in the tax law or an adverse interpretation of the tax law counterparties to these transactions provide citi with comparable indemnifications while such representations warranties and indemnifications are essential components of many contractual relationships they do not represent the underlying business purpose for the transactions the indemnification clauses are often standard contractual terms related to citi’s own performance under the terms of a contract and are entered into in the normal course of business based on an assessment that the risk of loss is remote often these clauses are intended to ensure that terms of a contract are met at inception no  compensation is received for these standard representations and warranties and it is not possible to determine their fair value because they rarely if ever result in a payment in many cases there are no  stated or notional amounts included in the indemnification clauses and the contingencies potentially triggering the obligation to indemnify have not occurred and are not expected to occur as a result these indemnifications are not included in the tables above 

valuetransfer networks 

citi is a member of or shareholder in hundreds of valuetransfer networks vtns payment clearing and settlement systems as well as exchanges around the world as a condition of membership many of these vtns require that members stand ready to pay a pro rata share of the losses incurred by the organization due to another member’s default on its obligations citi’s potential obligations may be limited to its membership interests in the vtns contributions to the vtn’s funds or in limited cases the obligation may be unlimited the maximum exposure cannot be estimated as this would require an assessment of future claims that have not yet 

occurred citi believes the risk of loss is remote given historical experience with the vtns accordingly citi’s participation in vtns is not reported in the guarantees tables above and there are no  amounts reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2015  or 2014  for potential obligations that could arise from citi’s involvement with vtn associations 

longterm care insurance indemnification 

in the sale of an insurance subsidiary the company provided an indemnification to an insurance company for policyholder claims and other liabilities relating to a book of longterm care ltc business for the entire term of the ltc policies that is fully reinsured by another insurance company the reinsurer has funded two  trusts with securities whose fair value approximately 63 billion  at december 31 2015  compared to 62 billion  at december 31 2014  is designed to cover the insurance company’s statutory liabilities for the ltc policies the assets in these trusts are evaluated and adjusted periodically to ensure that the fair value of the assets continues to cover the estimated statutory liabilities related to the ltc policies as those statutory liabilities change over time 

if the reinsurer fails to perform under the reinsurance agreement for any reason including insolvency and the assets in the two  trusts are insufficient or unavailable to the ceding insurance company then citi must indemnify the ceding insurance company for any losses actually incurred in connection with the ltc policies since both events would have to occur before citi would become responsible for any payment to the ceding insurance company pursuant to its indemnification obligation and the likelihood of such events occurring is currently not probable there is no  liability reflected in the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2015  and 2014  related to this indemnification citi continues to closely monitor its potential exposure under this indemnification obligation 

 

futures and overthecounter derivatives clearing 

citi provides clearing services for clients executing exchangetraded futures and overthecounter otc derivatives contracts with central counterparties ccps based on all relevant facts and circumstances citi has concluded that it acts as an agent for accounting purposes in its role as clearing member for these client transactions as such citi does not reflect the underlying exchangetraded futures or otc derivatives contracts in its consolidated financial statements see note 23 for a discussion of citi’s derivatives activities that are reflected in its consolidated financial statements 

as a clearing member citi collects and remits cash and securities collateral margin between its clients and the respective ccp there are two  types of margin initial margin and variation margin where citi obtains benefits from or controls cash initial margin eg retains an interest spread cash initial margin collected from clients and remitted to the ccp is reflected within brokerage payables  payables to customers and brokerage receivables  receivables from brokers dealers and clearing organizations respectively however for otc derivatives contracts where citi has contractually agreed with the client that i citi will pass through to the client all interest paid by the ccp on cash initial margin ii citi will not utilize its right as clearing member to transform cash margin into other assets and iii citi does not guarantee and is not liable to the client for the performance of the ccp cash initial margin collected from clients and remitted to the ccp is not reflected on citi’s consolidated balance sheet the total amount of cash initial margin collected and remitted in this manner was approximately 43 billion  and 32 billion  as of december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively 

variation margin due from clients to the respective ccp or from the ccp to clients reflects changes in the value of the client’s derivative contracts for each trading day as a clearing member citi is exposed to the risk of nonperformance by clients eg failure of a client to post variation margin to the ccp for negative changes in the value of the client’s derivative contracts in the event of nonperformance by a client citi would move to close out the client’s positions the ccp would typically utilize initial margin posted by the client and held by the ccp with any remaining shortfalls required to be paid by citi as clearing member citi generally holds incremental cash or securities margin posted by the client which would typically be expected to be sufficient to mitigate citi’s credit risk in the event the client fails to perform 

as required by asc 86030255 securities collateral posted by clients is not recognized on citi’s consolidated balance sheet 

carrying value—guarantees and indemnifications 

at december 31 2015  and 2014  the total carrying amounts of the liabilities related to the guarantees and indemnifications included in the tables above amounted to approximately 20 billion  and 31 billion  respectively the carrying value of financial and performance guarantees is included in other liabilities as is the carrying value of the liability for loans sold with recourse 

collateral 

cash collateral available to citi to reimburse losses realized under these guarantees and indemnifications amounted to 52 billion  and 63 billion  at december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively securities and other marketable assets held as collateral amounted to 33 billion  and 59 billion  at december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively the majority of collateral is held to reimburse losses realized under securities lending indemnifications additionally letters of credit in favor of citi held as collateral amounted to 42 billion  and 40 billion  at december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively other property may also be available to citi to cover losses under certain guarantees and indemnifications however the value of such property has not been determined 

 

performance risk 

citi evaluates the performance risk of its guarantees based on the assigned referenced counterparty internal or external ratings where external ratings are used investmentgrade ratings are considered to be baabbb and above while anything below is considered noninvestment grade citi’s internal ratings are in line with the related external rating system on certain underlying referenced assets or entities ratings are not available such referenced assets are included in the “not rated” category the maximum potential amount of the future payments related to the outstanding guarantees is determined to be the notional amount of these contracts which is the par amount of the assets guaranteed 

presented in the tables below are the maximum potential amounts of future payments that are classified based upon internal and external credit ratings as previously mentioned the determination of the maximum potential future payments is based on the notional amount of the guarantees without consideration of possible recoveries under recourse provisions or from collateral held or pledged as such citi believes such amounts bear no relationship to the anticipated losses if any on these guarantees 





credit commitments and lines of credit 

the table below summarizes citigroup’s credit commitments 



the majority of unused commitments are contingent upon customers’ maintaining specific credit standards 

commercial commitments generally have floating interest rates and fixed expiration dates and may require payment of fees such fees net of certain direct costs are deferred and upon exercise of the commitment amortized over the life of the loan or if exercise is deemed remote amortized over the commitment period 

commercial and similar letters of credit 

a commercial letter of credit is an instrument by which citigroup substitutes its credit for that of a customer to enable the customer to finance the purchase of goods or to incur other commitments citigroup issues a letter on behalf of its client to a supplier and agrees to pay the supplier upon presentation of documentary evidence that the supplier has performed in accordance with the terms of the letter of credit when a letter of credit is drawn the customer is then required to reimburse citigroup 

one to fourfamily residential mortgages 

a one to fourfamily residential mortgage commitment is a written confirmation from citigroup to a seller of a property that the bank will advance the specified sums enabling the buyer to complete the purchase 

revolving openend loans secured by one to fourfamily 

residential properties 

revolving openend loans secured by one to fourfamily residential properties are essentially home equity lines of credit a home equity line of credit is a loan secured by a primary residence or second home to the extent of the excess of fair market value over the debt outstanding for the first mortgage 

commercial real estate construction and land development 

commercial real estate construction and land development include unused portions of commitments to extend credit for the purpose of financing commercial and multifamily residential properties as well as land development projects 

 both securedbyrealestate and unsecured commitments are included in this line as well as undistributed loan proceeds where there is an obligation to advance for 

 

construction progress payments however this line only includes those extensions of credit that once funded will be classified as total loans net  on the consolidated balance sheet 

credit card lines 

citigroup provides credit to customers by issuing credit cards the credit card lines are cancellable by providing notice to the cardholder or without such notice as permitted by local law 

commercial and other consumer loan commitments 

commercial and other consumer loan commitments include overdraft and liquidity facilities as well as commercial commitments to make or purchase loans to purchase thirdparty receivables to provide note issuance or revolving underwriting facilities and to invest in the form of equity 

in addition included in this line item are highly leveraged financing commitments which are agreements that provide funding to a borrower with higher levels of debt measured by the ratio of debt capital to equity capital of the borrower than is generally considered normal for other companies this type of financing is commonly employed in corporate acquisitions management buyouts and similar transactions 

other commitments and contingencies 

other commitments and contingencies include committed or unsettled regularway reverse repurchase agreements and all other transactions related to commitments and contingencies not reported on the lines above

asc 450 governs the disclosure and recognition of loss contingencies including potential losses from litigation and regulatory matters asc 450 defines a “loss contingency” as “an existing condition situation or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss to an entity that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur” it imposes different requirements for the recognition and disclosure of loss contingencies based on the likelihood of occurrence of the contingent future event or events it distinguishes among degrees of likelihood using the following three terms “probable” meaning that “the future event or events are likely to occur” “remote” meaning that “the chance of the future event or events occurring is slight” and “reasonably possible” meaning that “the chance of the future event or events occurring is more than remote but less than likely” these three terms are used below as defined in asc 450 

accruals  asc 450 requires accrual for a loss contingency when it is “probable that one or more future events will occur confirming the fact of loss” and  “the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated” in accordance with asc 450 citigroup establishes accruals for contingencies including the litigation and regulatory matters disclosed herein when citigroup believes it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated when the reasonable estimate of the loss is within a range of amounts the minimum amount of the range is accrued unless some higher amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range once established accruals are adjusted from time to time as appropriate in light of additional information the amount of loss ultimately incurred in relation to those matters may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts accrued for those matters 

disclosure  asc 450 requires disclosure of a loss contingency if “there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may have been incurred” and  there is no accrual for the loss because the conditions described above are not met or an exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount accrued in accordance with asc 450 if citigroup has not accrued for a matter because citigroup believes that a loss is reasonably possible but not probable or that a loss is probable but not reasonably estimable and the matter thus does not meet the criteria for accrual and the reasonably possible loss is material it discloses the loss contingency in addition citigroup discloses matters for which it has accrued if it believes a reasonably possible exposure to material loss exists in excess of the amount accrued in accordance with asc 450 citigroup’s disclosure includes an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss for those matters as to which an estimate can be made asc 450 does not require disclosure of an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss where an estimate cannot be made neither accrual nor disclosure is required for losses that are deemed remote 

 

litigation and regulatory contingencies 

overview  in addition to the matters described below in the ordinary course of business citigroup its affiliates and subsidiaries and current and former officers directors and employees for purposes of this section sometimes collectively referred to as citigroup and related parties routinely are named as defendants in or as parties to various legal actions and proceedings certain of these actions and proceedings assert claims or seek relief in connection with alleged violations of consumer protection fair lending securities banking antifraud antitrust antimoney laundering employment and other statutory and common laws certain of these actual or threatened legal actions and proceedings include claims for substantial or indeterminate compensatory or punitive damages or for injunctive relief and in some instances seek recovery on a classwide basis 

in the ordinary course of business citigroup and related parties also are subject to governmental and regulatory examinations informationgathering requests investigations and proceedings both formal and informal certain of which may result in adverse judgments settlements fines penalties restitution disgorgement injunctions or other relief in addition certain affiliates and subsidiaries of citigroup are banks registered brokerdealers futures commission merchants investment advisers or other regulated entities and in those capacities are subject to regulation by various us state and foreign securities banking commodity futures consumer protection and other regulators in connection with formal and informal inquiries by these regulators citigroup and such affiliates and subsidiaries receive numerous requests subpoenas and orders seeking documents testimony and other information in connection with various aspects of their regulated activities from time to time citigroup and related parties also receive grand jury subpoenas and other requests for information or assistance formal or informal from federal or state law enforcement agencies including among others various united states attorneys’ offices the asset forfeiture and money laundering section and other divisions of the department of justice the financial crimes enforcement network of the united states department of the treasury and the federal bureau of investigation relating to citigroup and its customers 

because of the global scope of citigroup’s operations and its presence in countries around the world citigroup and related parties are subject to litigation and governmental and regulatory examinations informationgathering requests investigations and proceedings both formal and informal in multiple jurisdictions with legal and regulatory regimes that may differ substantially and present substantially different risks from those citigroup and related parties are subject to in the united states in some instances citigroup and related parties may be involved in proceedings involving the same subject matter in multiple jurisdictions which may result in overlapping cumulative or inconsistent outcomes 

citigroup seeks to resolve all litigation and regulatory matters in the manner management believes is in the best interests of citigroup and its shareholders and contests liability allegations of wrongdoing and where applicable the 

amount of damages or scope of any penalties or other relief sought as appropriate in each pending matter 

inherent uncertainty of the matters disclosed  certain of the matters disclosed below involve claims for substantial or indeterminate damages the claims asserted in these matters typically are broad often spanning a multiyear period and sometimes a wide range of business activities and the plaintiffs’ or claimants’ alleged damages frequently are not quantified or factually supported in the complaint or statement of claim other matters relate to regulatory investigations or proceedings as to which there may be no objective basis for quantifying the range of potential fine penalty or other remedy as a result citigroup is often unable to estimate the loss in such matters even if it believes that a loss is probable or reasonably possible until developments in the case or investigation have yielded additional information sufficient to support a quantitative assessment of the range of reasonably possible loss such developments may include among other things discovery from adverse parties or third parties rulings by the court on key issues analysis by retained experts and engagement in settlement negotiations depending on a range of factors such as the complexity of the facts the novelty of the legal theories the pace of discovery the court’s scheduling order the timing of court decisions and the adverse party’s willingness to negotiate in good faith toward a resolution it may be months or years after the filing of a case or commencement of an investigation before an estimate of the range of reasonably possible loss can be made 

matters as to which an estimate can be made  for some of the matters disclosed below citigroup is currently able to estimate a reasonably possible loss or range of loss in excess of amounts accrued if any for some of the matters included within this estimation an accrual has been made because a loss is believed to be both probable and reasonably estimable but an exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount accrued in these cases the estimate reflects the reasonably possible range of loss in excess of the accrued amount for other matters included within this estimation no accrual has been made because a loss although estimable is believed to be reasonably possible but not probable in these cases the estimate reflects the reasonably possible loss or range of loss as of december 31 2015 citigroup estimates that the reasonably possible unaccrued loss for these matters ranges up to approximately 35  billion in the aggregate 

these estimates are based on currently available information as available information changes the matters for which citigroup is able to estimate will change and the estimates themselves will change in addition while many estimates presented in financial statements and other financial disclosures involve significant judgment and may be subject to significant uncertainty estimates of the range of reasonably possible loss arising from litigation and regulatory proceedings are subject to particular uncertainties for example at the time of making an estimate i citigroup may have only preliminary incomplete or inaccurate information about the facts underlying the claim ii its assumptions about the future rulings of the court or other tribunal on significant issues or the behavior and incentives of adverse parties or regulators may prove to be wrong and iii the outcomes it is 

 

attempting to predict are often not amenable to the use of statistical or other quantitative analytical tools in addition from time to time an outcome may occur that citigroup had not accounted for in its estimate because it had deemed such an outcome to be remote for all these reasons the amount of loss in excess of accruals ultimately incurred for the matters as to which an estimate has been made could be substantially higher or lower than the range of loss included in the estimate 

matters as to which an estimate cannot be made  for other matters disclosed below citigroup is not currently able to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss many of these matters remain in very preliminary stages even in some cases where a substantial period of time has passed since the commencement of the matter with few or no substantive legal decisions by the court or tribunal defining the scope of the claims the class if any or the potentially available damages and fact discovery is still in progress or has not yet begun in many of these matters citigroup has not yet answered the complaint or statement of claim or asserted its defenses nor has it engaged in any negotiations with the adverse party whether a regulator or a private party for all these reasons citigroup cannot at this time estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss if any for these matters 

opinion of management as to eventual outcome  subject to the foregoing it is the opinion of citigroup’s management based on current knowledge and after taking into account its current legal accruals that the eventual outcome of all matters described in this note would not be likely to have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition of citigroup nonetheless given the substantial or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and the inherent unpredictability of such matters an adverse outcome in certain of these matters could from time to time have a material adverse effect on citigroup’s consolidated results of operations or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods

business risks 

citi is subject to extensive litigation investigations and inquiries pertaining to a myriad of us mortgagerelated activities that could take significant time to resolve and may subject citi to extensive liability including in the form of penalties and other equitable remedies that could negatively impact citi’s future results of operations virtually every aspect of mortgagerelated activity in the us is being challenged across the financial services industry in private and public litigation and by regulators governmental agencies and state attorneys general among others examples of the activities being challenged include the accuracy of offering documents for residential mortgagebacked securities potential breaches of representations and warranties in the placement of mortgage loans into securitization trusts mortgage servicing practices the legitimacy of the securitization of mortgage loans and the mortgage electronic registration system’s role in tracking mortgages holding title and participating in the mortgage foreclosure process fair lending compliance with the servicemembers civil relief act and false claim act violations alleged in “qui tam” cases among others   sorting out which of the many claims being asserted has legal merit as well as which financial institutions may be subject to liability with respect to their actual practices is a complex process that is highly uncertain and will take time to resolve all of these inquiries actions and investigations have resulted in and will likely continue to result in significant time expense and diversion of management’s attention and could result in significant liability as well as negative reputational and other costs to citi   citi is currently party to numerous actions relating to claims of misrepresentations or omissions in offering documents of residential mortgagebacked securities sponsored or serviced by citi affiliates this litigation has been brought by a number of institutional investors including the federal housing finance agency the cases are all in early stages making it difficult to predict how they will develop and citi believes that such litigation will continue for several years in addition because the statute of limitations will soon expire for these types of disclosurebased claims citi could experience an increase in filed claims in the near term   citi is exposed to representation and warranty ie mortgage repurchase liability through its us consumer mortgage businesses and to a lesser extent through legacy privatelabel residential mortgage securitizations sponsored by its sb business with respect to its consumer businesses during 2011 citi increased its repurchase reserve from approximately 969 million to 12 billion at december 31 2011 to date the majority of repurchase demands have come from the gses the level of repurchase demands by gses has been trending upwards and citi currently expects it to remain elevated for some time to a lesser extent citi has received repurchase demands from private investors although these claims have been volatile and could increase in the future   

  with regard to legacy sb privatelabel mortgage securitizations while sb has to date received actual claims for breaches of representations and warranties relating to only a small percentage of the mortgages included in its securitization transactions the pace of claims remains volatile and has recently increased citi has also experienced an increase in the level of inquiries assertions and requests for loan files among other matters relating to such securitization transactions from trustees of securitization trusts and others these inquiries could lead to actual claims for breaches of representations and warranties or to litigation relating to such breaches or other matters for additional information on these matters see “managing global risk—credit risk—consumer mortgage—representations and warranties” and “— securities and banking sponsored privatelabel residential mortgage securitizations—representations and warranties” below   for further discussion of the matters above see note 29 to the consolidated financial statements 

citi will not be able to wind down citi holdings at the same pace as it has in the past three years as a result the remaining assets in citi holdings will likely continue to have a negative impact on citi’s results of operations and its ability to utilize the capital supporting the remaining assets in citi holdings for more productive purposes citi will not be able to dispose of or wind down the businesses or assets that are part of citi holdings at the same level or pace as in the past three years as of december 31 2011 assuming the transfer to citicorp of the substantial majority of retail partner cards effective in the first quarter of 2012 lcl constituted approximately 70 of citi holdings as of such date over half of the remaining assets in lcl consisted of legacy us mortgages which will likely be subject to runoff over an extended period of time besides mortgages the remaining assets in lcl include the onemain financial business as well as student commercial real estate and credit card loans in north america  and consumer lending businesses in europe and asia    bam primarily consists of the mssb jv morgan stanley has call rights on citi’s ownership interest in the venture over a threeyear period beginning in 2012 which it is not required to exercise of the remaining assets in sap  interestearning assets have become a smaller portion of the assets causing negative net interest revenues in the business as the remaining noninterest earning assets which require funding represent a larger portion of the total asset pool in addition as of december 31 2011 approximately 25 of the remaining assets in sap were heldtomaturity securities   as a result the remaining assets within citi holdings will likely continue to have a negative impact on citi’s overall results of operations for the foreseeable future particularly after the transfer of retail partner cards to citicorp in addition as of december 31 2011 and as adjusted to reflect the transfer of retail partner cards roughly 21 of citi’s riskweighted assets were in citi holdings and were supported by approximately 24 billion of citi’s regulatory capital accordingly citi’s ability to release the capital supporting these businesses and thus use such capital for more productive purposes will depend on the ultimate pace and level of citi holdings divestitures portfolio runoffs and asset sales 

citi’s ability to increase its common stock dividend or initiate a share repurchase program is subject to regulatory and government approval since the second quarter of 2011 citi has paid a quarterly common stock dividend of 001 per share in addition to board of directors’ approval any decision by citi to increase its common stock dividend including the amount thereof or initiate a share repurchase program is subject to regulatory approval including the results of the comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar process required by the federal reserve board restrictions on citi’s ability to increase the amounts of its common stock dividend or engage in share repurchase programs could negatively impact market perceptions of citi including the price of its common stock   in addition pursuant to its agreements with certain us government entities dated june 9 2009 executed in connection with citi’s exchange offers consummated in july and september 2009 citi remains subject to dividend and share repurchase restrictions for as long as the us government continues to hold any citi trust preferred securities acquired in connection with the exchange offers while these restrictions may be waived they generally prohibit citi from paying regular cash dividends in excess of 001 per share of common stock per quarter or from redeeming or repurchasing any citi equity securities which includes its common stock or trust preferred securities as of december 31 2011 approximately 3025 billion of trust preferred securities issued to the fdic remained outstanding of which approximately 800 million is being held for the benefit of the us treasury 

citi may be unable to maintain or reduce its level of expenses as it expects and investments in its businesses may not be productive citi continues to pursue a disciplined expensemanagement strategy including reengineering restructuring operations and improving the efficiency of functions such as call centers and collections to achieve a targeted percentage expense savings annually however there is no guarantee that citi will be able to maintain or reduce its level of expenses in the future particularly as expenses incurred in citi’s foreign entities are subject to foreign exchange volatility and regulatory compliance and legal and related costs are difficult to predict or control particularly given the current regulatory and litigation environment moreover citi has incurred and will likely continue to incur costs of investing in its businesses these investments may not be as productive as citi expects or at all furthermore as the wind down of citi holdings slows citi’s ability to continue to reduce its expenses as a result of this wind down will also decline 

the value of citi’s deferred tax assets dtas could be reduced if corporate tax rates in the us or certain state or foreign jurisdictions are decreased or as a result of other potential significant changes in the us corporate tax system there have been discussions in congress and by the obama administration regarding potentially decreasing the us corporate tax rate similar discussions have taken place in certain state and foreign jurisdictions while citi may benefit in some respects from any decreases in these corporate tax rates any reduction in the us state or foreign corporate tax rates would result in a decrease to the value of citi’s dtas which could be significant there have also been recent discussions of more sweeping changes to the us tax system including changes to the tax treatment of foreign business income it is uncertain whether or when any such tax reform proposals will be enacted into law and whether or how they will affect citi’s ability to make effective use of its dtas 

the expiration of a provision of the us tax law that allows citi to defer us taxes on certain active financing income could significantly increase citi’s tax expense citi’s tax provision has historically been reduced because active financing income earned and indefinitely reinvested outside the us is taxed at the lower local tax rate rather than at the higher us tax rate such reduction has been dependent upon a provision of the us tax law that defers the imposition of us taxes on certain active financing income until that income is repatriated to the us as a dividend this “active financing exception” expired on december 31 2011 with respect to taxable years beginning after such date while the exception has been scheduled to expire on numerous prior occasions congress has extended it each time including retroactively to the start of the tax year congress could still take action to retroactively extend the active financing exception to the beginning of 2012 however there can be no assurance that it will do so if the exception is not extended the us tax imposed on citi’s active financing income earned outside the us would increase which could further result in citi’s tax expense increasing significantly particularly beginning in 2013 

citi’s operational systems and networks have been and will continue to be vulnerable to an increasing risk of continually evolving cybersecurity or other technological risks which could result in the disclosure of confidential client or customer information damage to citi’s reputation additional costs to citi regulatory penalties and financial losses a significant portion of citi’s operations relies heavily on the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential and other information as well as the monitoring of a large number of complex transactions on a minutebyminute basis for example through its global consumer banking credit card and transaction services businesses citi obtains and stores an extensive amount of personal and clientspecific information for its retail corporate and governmental customers and clients and must accurately record and reflect their extensive account transactions these activities have been and will continue to be subject to an increasing risk of cyber attacks the nature of which is continually evolving   citi’s computer systems software and networks have been and will continue to be vulnerable to unauthorized access loss or destruction of data including confidential client information account takeovers unavailability of service computer viruses or other malicious code cyber attacks and other events these threats may derive from human error fraud or malice on the part of employees or third parties or may result from accidental technological failure if one or more of these events occurs it could result in the disclosure of confidential client information damage to citi’s reputation with its clients and the market additional costs to citi such as repairing systems or adding new personnel or protection technologies regulatory penalties and financial losses to both citi and its clients and customers such events could also cause interruptions or malfunctions in the operations of citi such as the lack of availability of citi’s online banking system as well as the operations of its clients customers or other third parties given the high volume of transactions at citi certain errors or actions may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and rectified which would further increase these costs and consequences   citi has recently been subject to intentional cyber incidents from external sources including i data breaches which resulted in unauthorized access to customer account data and interruptions of services to customers ii malicious software attacks on client systems which in turn allowed unauthorized entrance to citi’s systems under the guise of a client and the extraction of client data and iii denial of service attacks which attempted to interrupt service to clients and customers while citi was able to detect these prior incidents before they became significant they still resulted in losses as well as increases in expenditures to monitor against the threat of similar future cyber incidents there can be no assurance that such incidents or other cyber incidents will not occur again and they could occur more frequently and on a more significant scale 

  in addition third parties with which citi does business may also be sources of cybersecurity or other technological risks citi outsources certain functions such as processing of customer credit card transactions which results in the storage and processing of customer information by third parties while citi engages in certain actions to reduce the exposure resulting from outsourcing such as limiting thirdparty access to the least privileged level necessary to perform job functions and restricting thirdparty processing to systems stored within citi’s data centers unauthorized access loss or destruction of data or other cyber incidents could occur resulting in similar costs and consequences to citi as those discussed above furthermore because financial institutions are becoming increasingly interconnected with central agents exchanges and clearing houses including through the derivatives provisions of the doddfrank act citi has increased exposure to operational failure or cyber attacks through third parties   while citi maintains insurance coverage that may subject to policy terms and conditions including significant selfinsured deductibles cover certain aspects of cyber risks such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses 

citi’s financial statements are based in part on assumptions and estimates which if wrong could cause unexpected losses in the future sometimes significant pursuant to us gaap citi is required to use certain assumptions and estimates in preparing its financial statements including in determining credit loss reserves reserves related to litigation and regulatory exposures mortgage representation and warranty claims and the fair value of certain assets and liabilities among other items if the assumptions or estimates underlying citi’s financial statements are incorrect citi may experience significant losses for additional information on the key areas for which assumptions and estimates are used in preparing citi’s financial statements see “significant accounting policies and significant estimates” below and for further information relating to litigation and regulatory exposures see note 29 to the consolidated financial statements 

citi is subject to a significant number of legal and regulatory proceedings that are often highly complex slow to develop and are thus difficult to predict or estimate at any given time citi is defending a significant number of legal and regulatory proceedings the volume of claims and the amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation arbitration and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions remain high and could further increase in the future see for example “—citi is subject to extensive litigation investigations and inquiries pertaining to a myriad of mortgagerelated activities that could take significant time to resolve and may subject citi to extensive liability including in the form of penalties and other equitable remedies that could negatively impact citi’s future results of operations”   proceedings brought against citi may result in judgments settlements fines penalties disgorgement injunctions business improvement orders or other results adverse to it which could materially and negatively affect citi’s businesses financial condition or results of operations require material   

changes in citi’s operations or cause citi reputational harm moreover the many large claims asserted against citi are highly complex and slow to develop and they may involve novel or untested legal theories the outcome of such proceedings may thus be difficult to predict or estimate until late in the proceedings which may last several years in addition certain settlements are subject to court approval and may not be approved although citi establishes accruals for its litigation and regulatory matters according to accounting requirements the amount of loss ultimately incurred in relation to those matters may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts accrued   in addition while citi takes numerous steps to prevent and detect employee misconduct such as fraud employee misconduct is not always possible to deter or prevent and the extensive precautions citi takes to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases which could subject it to additional liability moreover the “whistleblower” provisions of the doddfrank act provide substantial financial incentives for persons to report alleged violations of law to the sec and the cftc the final rules implementing these provisions for the sec and cftc became effective in august and october 2011 respectively as such there continues to be much uncertainty as to whether these new reporting provisions will incentivize and lead to an increase in the number of claims that citi will have to investigate or against which citi will have to defend itself thus potentially further increasing citi’s legal liabilities   for additional information relating to citi’s potential exposure relating to legal and regulatory matters see note 29 to the consolidated financial statements 

failure to maintain the value of the citi brand could harm citi’s global competitive advantage results of operations and strategy as citi enters into its 200 th year of operations in 2012 one of its most valuable assets is the citi brand citi’s ability to continue to leverage its extensive global footprint and thus maintain one of its key competitive advantages depends on the continued strength and recognition of the citi brand including in emerging markets as other financial institutions grow their operations in these markets and competition intensifies as referenced above as a result of the economic crisis in the us as well as the continuing adverse economic climate globally citi like other financial institutions is subject to an increased level of distrust scrutiny and skepticism from numerous constituencies including the general public the citi brand could be further harmed if its public image or reputation were to be tarnished by negative publicity whether or not true about citi or the financial services industry in general or by a negative perception of citi’s shortterm or longterm financial prospects maintaining promoting and positioning the citi brand will depend largely on citi’s ability to provide consistent highquality financial services and products to its clients and customers around the world failure to maintain its brand could hurt citi’s competitive advantage results of operations and strategy 

citi may incur significant losses if its risk management processes and strategies are ineffective and concentration of risk increases the potential for such losses citi monitors and controls its risk exposure across businesses regions and critical products through a risk and control framework encompassing a variety of separate but complementary financial credit operational compliance and legal reporting systems internal controls management review processes and other mechanisms while citi employs a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and risk mitigation techniques those techniques and the judgments that accompany their application may not be effective and may not anticipate every economic and financial outcome in all market environments or the specifics and timing of such outcomes market conditions over the last several years have involved unprecedented dislocations and highlight the limitations inherent in using historical data to manage risk   concentration of risk increases the potential for significant losses because of concentration of risk citi may suffer losses even when economic and market conditions are generally favorable for citi’s competitors these concentrations can limit and have limited the effectiveness of citi’s hedging strategies and have caused citi to incur significant losses and they may do so again in the future in addition citi extends large commitments as part of its credit origination activities if citi is unable to reduce its credit risk by selling syndicating or securitizing these positions including during periods of market dislocation citi’s results of operations could be negatively affected due to a decrease in the fair value of the positions as well as the loss of revenues associated with selling such securities or loans   although citi’s activities expose it to the credit risk of many different entities and counterparties citi routinely executes a high volume of transactions with counterparties in the financial services sector including banks other financial institutions insurance companies investment banks and government and central banks this has resulted in significant credit concentration with respect to this sector to the extent regulatory or market developments lead to an increased centralization of trading activity through particular clearing houses central agents or exchanges this could increase citi’s concentration of risk in this sector 

managing global risk 

risk management—overview citigroup believes that effective risk management is of primary importance to its overall operations accordingly citigroup has a comprehensive risk management process to monitor evaluate and manage the principal risks it assumes in conducting its activities these include credit market and operational risks which are each discussed in more detail throughout this section   citigroup’s risk management framework is designed to balance corporate oversight with welldefined independent risk management functions enhancements continued to be made to the risk management framework throughout 2011 based on guiding principles established by citi’s chief risk officer 

a common risk capital model to evaluate risks a defined risk appetite aligned with business strategy accountability through a common framework to manage risks risk decisions based on transparent accurate and rigorous analytics expertise stature authority and independence of risk managers and empowering risk managers to make decisions and escalate issues   significant focus has been placed on fostering a risk culture based on a policy of “taking intelligent risk with shared responsibility without forsaking individual accountability” 

“taking intelligent risk” means that citi must carefully measure and aggregate risks must appreciate potential downside risks and must understand riskreturn relationships “shared responsibility” means that risk and business management must actively partner to own risk controls and influence business outcomes “individual accountability” means that all individuals are ultimately responsible for identifying understanding and managing risks   the chief risk officer working closely with the citi chief executive officer and established management committees and with oversight from the risk management and finance committee of the board of directors as well as the full board of directors is responsible for 

establishing core standards for the management measurement and reporting of risk identifying assessing communicating and monitoring risks on a companywide basis engaging with senior management on a frequent basis on material matters with respect to risktaking activities in the businesses and related risk management processes and ensuring that the risk function has adequate independence authority expertise staffing technology and resources 

  the risk management organization is structured so as to facilitate the management of risk across three dimensions businesses regions and critical products each of citi’s major business groups has a business chief risk officer who is the focal point for risk decisions such as setting risk limits or approving transactions in the business the majority of the staff in citi’s independent risk management organization report to these business chief risk officers there are also chief risk officers for citibank na and citi holdings   regional chief risk officers appointed in each of asia  emea and latin america  are accountable for all the risks in their geographic areas and are the primary risk contacts for the regional business heads and local regulators in addition the positions of product chief risk officers are created for those risk areas of critical importance to citigroup currently real estate and structural market risk as well as fundamental credit the product chief risk officers are accountable for the risks within their specialty and focus on problem areas across businesses and regions the product chief risk officers serve as a resource to the chief risk officer as well as to the business and regional chief risk officers to better enable the business and regional chief risk officers to focus on the daytoday management of risks and responsiveness to business flow   in addition to facilitating the management of risk across these three dimensions the independent risk management organization also includes the business management team to ensure that the risk organization has the appropriate infrastructure processes and management reporting this team includes 

the risk capital group which continues to enhance the risk capital model and ensure that it is consistent across all business activities the risk architecture group which ensures citi has integrated systems and common metrics thereby allowing citi to aggregate and stress test exposures across the institution the enterprise risk management group which focuses on improving citi’s operational processes across businesses and regions see “operational risk” below and the office of the chief administrative officer which focuses on reengineering and risk communications including maintaining critical regulatory relationships   each of the business regional and product chief risk officers as well as the heads of the groups in the business management team report to citi’s chief risk officer who reports directly to the chief executive officer 

risk aggregation and stress testing while citi’s major risk areas are described individually on the following pages these risks are also reviewed and managed in conjunction with one another and across the various businesses   the chief risk officer as noted above monitors and controls major risk exposures and concentrations across the organization this means aggregating risks within and across businesses as well as subjecting those risks to alternative stress scenarios in order to assess the potential economic impact they may have on citigroup   comprehensive stress tests are in place across citi for trading availableforsale and accrual portfolios these firmwide stress reports measure the potential impact to citi and its component businesses of very large changes in various types of key risk factors eg interest rates credit spreads etc as well as the potential impact of a number of historical and hypothetical forwardlooking systemic stress scenarios   supplementing the stress testing described above citi independent risk management working with input from the businesses and finance provides periodic updates to senior management on significant potential areas of concern across citigroup that can arise from risk concentrations financial market participants and other systemic issues these areas of focus are intended to be forwardlooking assessments of the potential economic impacts to citi that may arise from these exposures risk management also provides reports to the risk management and finance committee of the board of directors as well as the full board of directors on these matters   the stresstesting and focusposition exercises are a supplement to the standard limitsetting and riskcapital exercises described below as these processes incorporate events in the marketplace and within citi that impact the firm’s outlook on the form magnitude correlation and timing of identified risks that may arise in addition to enhancing awareness and understanding of potential exposures the results of these processes then serve as the starting point for developing risk management and mitigation strategies 

risk capital risk capital is defined as the amount of capital required to absorb potential unexpected economic losses resulting from extremely severe events over a oneyear time period 

“economic losses” include losses that are reflected on citi’s consolidated income statement and fair value adjustments to the consolidated financial statements as well as any further declines in value not captured on the consolidated income statement “unexpected losses” are the difference between potential extremely severe losses and citigroup’s expected average loss over a oneyear time period “extremely severe” is defined as potential loss at a 999 and a 9997 confidence level based on the distribution of observed events and scenario analysis   the drivers of economic losses are risks which for citi as referenced above are broadly categorized as credit risk market risk and operational risk 

credit risk losses primarily result from a borrower’s or counterparty’s inability to meet its financial or contractual obligations market risk losses arise from fluctuations in the market value of trading and nontrading positions including the changes in value resulting from fluctuations in rates operational risk losses result from inadequate or failed internal processes systems or human factors or from external events   these risks discussed in more detail below are measured and aggregated within businesses and across citigroup to facilitate the understanding of citi’s exposure to extreme downside events as described under “risk aggregation and stress testing” above the risk capital framework is reviewed and enhanced on a regular basis in light of market developments and evolving practices 

credit risk credit risk is the potential for financial loss resulting from the failure of a borrower or counterparty to honor its financial or contractual obligations credit risk arises in many of citigroup’s business activities including 

lending sales and trading derivatives securities transactions settlement and when citigroup acts as an intermediary   for citi’s loan accounting policies see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements see notes 16 and 17 for additional information on citigroup’s consumer and corporate loan credit and allowance data

nonaccrual loans and assets and renegotiated loans the following pages include information on citi’s “nonaccrual loans and assets” and “renegotiated loans” there is a certain amount of overlap among these categories the following general summary provides a basic description of each category 

nonaccrual loans and assets 

corporate and consumer commercial market nonaccrual status is based on the determination that payment of interest or principal is doubtful consumer nonaccrual status is based on aging ie the borrower has fallen behind in payments north america citibranded and retail partner cards are not included because under industry standards they accrue interest until chargeoff renegotiated loans 

both corporate and consumer loans whose terms have been modified in a tdr includes both accrual and nonaccrual tdrs 

nonaccrual loans and assets the table below summarizes citigroup’s nonaccrual loans as of the periods indicated nonaccrual loans are loans in which the borrower has fallen behind in interest payments or for corporate and consumer commercial market loans where citi has determined that the payment of interest or principal is doubtful and which are therefore considered impaired in situations where citi reasonably expects that only a portion of the principal andor interest owed will ultimately be collected all payments received are reflected as a reduction of principal and not as interest income there is no industrywide definition of nonaccrual assets however and as such analysis across the industry is not always comparable   corporate nonaccrual loans may still be current on interest payments but are considered nonaccrual as citi has determined that the future payment of interest andor principal is doubtful consistent with industry conventions citi generally accrues interest on credit card loans until such loans are chargedoff which typically occurs at 180 days contractual delinquency as such the nonaccrual loan disclosures in this section do not include north america credit card loans

north america consumer mortgage lending 

overview citi’s north america consumer mortgage portfolio consists of both residential first mortgages and home equity loans as of december 31 2011 citi’s north america consumer residential first mortgage portfolio totaled 954 billion while the home equity loan portfolio was 435 billion of the first mortgages 675 billion are recorded in lcl within citi holdings with the remaining 279 billion recorded in citicorp with respect to the home equity loan portfolio 400 billion are recorded in lcl  and 35 billion are reported in citicorp   citi’s residential first mortgage portfolio included 92 billion of loans with fha insurance or va guarantees as of december 31 2011 this portfolio consists of loans originated to lowtomoderateincome borrowers with lower fico fair isaac corporation scores and generally has higher loantovalue ratios ltvs losses on fha loans are borne by the sponsoring agency provided that the insurance terms have not been rescinded as a result of an origination defect with respect to va loans the va establishes a loanlevel loss cap beyond which citi is liable for loss while fha and va loans have high delinquency rates given the insurance and guarantees respectively citi has experienced negligible credit losses on these loans to date   also as of december 31 2011 the residential first mortgage portfolio included 16 billion of loans with ltvs above 80 which have insurance through mortgage insurance companies and 12 billion of loans subject to longterm standby commitments ltsc with us governmentsponsored entities gses for which citi has limited exposure to credit losses citi’s home equity loan portfolio also included 04 billion of loans subject to ltscs with gses for which citi also has limited exposure to credit losses these guarantees and commitments may be rescinded in the event of origination defects 

  citi’s allowance for loan loss calculations takes into consideration the impact of the guarantees and commitments referenced above   citi does not offer option adjustable rate mortgagesnegative amortizing mortgage products to its customers as a result option adjustable rate mortgagesnegative amortizing mortgages represent an insignificant portion of total balances since they were acquired only incidentally as part of prior portfolio and business purchases   as of december 31 2011 citi’s north america residential first mortgage portfolio contained approximately 15 billion of adjustable rate mortgages that are required to make a payment only of accrued interest for the payment period or an interestonly payment borrowers that are currently required to make an interestonly payment cannot select a lower payment that would negatively amortize the loan residential first mortgages with this payment feature are primarily to highcreditquality borrowers that have on average significantly higher origination and refreshed fico scores than other loans in the residential first mortgage portfolio 

north america consumer mortgage quarterly credit trends—delinquencies and net credit losses—residential first mortgages the following charts detail the quarterly trends in delinquencies and net credit losses for citi’s residential first mortgage portfolio in north america  as referenced in the “overview” section above the majority of citi’s residential first mortgage exposure arises from its portfolio within citi holdings – lcl

notes – totals may not sum due to rounding 

– for each of the tables above days past due exclude us mortgage loans that are guaranteed by us government agencies because the potential loss predominantly resides with the us agencies and loans recorded at fair value 

  as previously disclosed management actions including asset sales and modification programs have been the primary drivers of the improved asset performance within citi’s residential first mortgage portfolio in citi holdings during the periods presented above with respect to asset sales in total citi has sold approximately 76 billion of delinquent first mortgages since the beginning of 2010 including 27 billion in 2011 as evidenced by the numbers above the pace of citi’s sales of residential first mortgages has slowed primarily due to the lack of remaining eligible inventory and demand   regarding modifications of residential first mortgages since the third quarter of 2009 citi has permanently modified approximately 61 billion of residential first mortgage loans under its hamp and csm programs two of citi’s more significant residential first mortgage modification programs for additional information on citi’s significant residential first mortgage loan modification programs see “consumer loan modification programs” below however the pace of modification activity has also slowed due to the 

decrease in the inventory of residential first mortgage loans available for modification primarily as a result of the significant levels of modifications in prior periods   as a result of these two converging trends and as set forth in the tables above citi’s residential first mortgage delinquency trends are beginning to show the impact of redefaults of previously modified mortgages including an increase in the 90 days past due delinquencies during the fourth quarter of 2011 although the redefault rates for the hamp and csm programs continued to track favorably versus expectations as of december 31 2011 while net credit losses in this portfolio decreased during the periods set forth above if delinquencies continue to increase citi could begin experiencing increasing net credit losses in this portfolio going forward citi has taken these trends and uncertainties including the potential for redefaults into consideration in determining its loan loss reserves see “ north america consumer mortgages – loan loss reserve coverage” below 

residential first mortgages – state delinquency trends the following tables set forth for total citigroup the six states andor regions with the highest concentration of citi’s residential first mortgages as of december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 

    as evidenced by the tables above citi’s residential first mortgages portfolio is primarily concentrated in california and the new yorknew jerseyconnecticut region with new york as the largest of the three states year over year the 90 days past due delinquency rate improved across each of the states and regions shown in the tables as referenced under “citi holdings—residential first mortgages” above however the vast majority of the improvement in these delinquency rates was driven by citi’s continued asset sales of delinquent mortgages as asset sales have slowed citi has observed deterioration in 90 days past due delinquencies for each of the states andor regions above including during the fourth quarter of 2011 combined with the increase in the average number of days to foreclosure see discussion under “foreclosures” below in all of these states and regions citi could experience continued deterioration in the 90 days past due delinquency rate in these areas 

foreclosures as of december 31 2011 approximately 25 of citi’s residential first mortgage portfolio was actively in the foreclosure process which citi refers to as its “foreclosure inventory” this was down from 31 at december 31 2010 the decline in foreclosure inventory year over year was largely due to two separate trends first during 2011 there were fewer residential first mortgages moving into citi’s foreclosure inventory primarily as a result of citi’s continued asset sales of delinquent first mortgages as discussed above as well as increased state requirements for foreclosure filings for example certain states have increased the number of preforeclosure filings and notices required including various requirements for affidavit filings and demand letters including the contents of such letters as well as required additional time to review a borrower’s loss mitigation activities prior to permitting a foreclosure filing in addition while citi may generally begin 

the foreclosure process when loans are 90 days past due not all such loans become part of citi’s foreclosure inventory as citi may not refer such loans to foreclosure as it continues to work with the borrower pursuant to its loss mitigation programs or for other reasons this also decreased the number of residential first mortgages moving into citi’s foreclosure inventory   second while loans exited foreclosure inventory during 2011 this was not necessarily due to completion of foreclosure and sale loans may exit foreclosure inventory if citi renews efforts to work with the borrower pursuant to its loss mitigation programs if the borrower enters bankruptcy proceedings if citi decides not to pursue the foreclosure or for other reasons in each of the circumstances described in the discussion above however the loans continue to age through citi’s delinquency buckets and remain part of its nonaccrual assets   in addition to the decline in the actual number of completed foreclosures the overall foreclosure process has lengthened this is particularly pronounced in judicial states ie those states that require foreclosures to be processed via court approval—including new york new jersey florida and illinois—but has also occurred in nonjudicial states where citi has a higher concentration of residential first mortgages see “residential first mortgages—state delinquency trends” above the lengthening of the foreclosure process is due to numerous factors including without limitation the increased state requirements referenced above citi’s continued work with borrowers through its various modification programs and the overall depressed state of home sales in certain of citi’s high concentration markets as one example of the lengthening of the foreclosure process citi’s aged foreclosure inventory active foreclosures in process for two years or more as a proportion of citi’s total foreclosure inventory more than doubled year over year while the proportion of aged foreclosure inventory continued to represent a small portion of the total approximately 10 as of december 31 2011 citi believes this trend reflects the increased time involved in the foreclosure process and believes this trend could continue due in part to the issues discussed above   when combined with the continued pressure on home prices particularly in certain regions where citi has a higher concentration of residential first mortgages this lengthening of the foreclosure process also subjects citi to increased “severity” risk or the magnitude of the loss on the amount ultimately realized for the property subject to foreclosure as well as increased ongoing costs related to the foreclosure process such as property maintenance 

north america consumer mortgage quarterly credit trends—delinquencies and net credit losses—home equity loans citi’s home equity loan portfolio consists of both fixed rate home equity loans and loans extended under home equity lines of credit fixed rate home equity loans are fully amortizing home equity lines of credit allow for amounts to be drawn for a period of time and then at the end of the draw period the thenoutstanding amount is converted to an amortizing loan after conversion the loan typically has a 20year amortization repayment period 

  historically citi’s home equity lines of credit typically had a 10year draw period beginning in june 2010 citi’s new originations of home equity lines of credit typically have a fiveyear draw period as citi changed these terms to mitigate risk due to the economic environment and declining home prices as of december 31 2011 citi’s home equity loan portfolio included approximately 25 billion of home equity lines of credit that are still within their revolving period and have not commenced amortization the interestonly payment feature during the revolving period is standard for this product across the industry the vast majority of citi’s home equity loans extended under lines of credit as of december 31 2011 will contractually begin to amortize after 2014   as of december 31 2011 the percentage of us home equity loans in a junior lien position where citi also owned or serviced the first lien was approximately 31 however for all home equity loans regardless of whether citi owns or services the first lien citi manages its home equity loan account strategy through obtaining and reviewing refreshed credit bureau scores which reflect the borrower’s performance on all of its debts including a first lien if any refreshed ltv ratios and other borrower creditrelated information historically the default and delinquency statistics for junior liens where citi also owns or services the first lien have been better than for those where citi does not own or service the first lien which citi believes is generally attributable to origination channels and better credit characteristics of the portfolio including fico and ltv for those junior liens where citi also owns or services the first lien

 notes – totals may not sum due to rounding 

  as evidenced by the tables above the pace of improvement in home equity loan delinquencies has slowed or remained flat given the lack of market in which to sell delinquent home equity loans as well as the relatively smaller number of home equity loan modifications and modification programs citi’s ability to offset increased delinquencies and net credit losses in its home equity loan portfolio in citi holdings has been more limited as compared to residential first mortgages as discussed above accordingly citi could begin to experience increased delinquencies and thus increased net credit losses 

in this portfolio going forward citi has taken these trends and uncertainties into consideration in determining its loan loss reserves see “ north america consumer mortgages – loan loss reserve coverage” below home equity loans– state delinquency trends the following tables set forth for total citigroup the six states andor regions with the highest concentration of citi’s home equity loans as of december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 

    similar to residential first mortgages see “residential first mortgages—state delinquency trends” above at december 31 2011 citi’s home equity loan portfolio was primarily concentrated in california and the new yorknew jerseyconnecticut region year over year 90 days past due delinquencies improved or remained stable across each of the states and regions shown in the tables see also “consumer mortgage fico and ltv” below 

north america consumer mortgages – loan loss reserve coverage at december 31 2011 approximately 98 billion of citi’s total loan loss reserves of 301 billion was allocated to north america real estate lending in citi holdings representing approximately 31 months of coincident net credit loss coverage as of such date with respect to citi’s aggregate north america consumer mortgage portfolio including citi holdings as well as the residential first mortgages and home equity loans in citicorp citi’s loan loss reserves of 100 billion at december 31 2011 represented 30 months of coincident net credit loss coverage 

consumer mortgage fico and ltv as a consequence of the financial crisis economic environment and the decrease in housing prices ltv and fico scores for citi’s residential first mortgage and home equity loan portfolios have generally deteriorated since origination particularly in the case of originations between 2006 and 2007 although as set forth in the tables below the negative migration has generally stabilized generally on a refreshed basis approximately 30 of residential first mortgages had a ltv ratio above 100 compared to approximately 0 at origination similarly approximately 36 of residential first mortgages had fico scores less than 660 on a refreshed basis compared to 27 at origination with respect to home equity loans approximately 45 of home equity loans had refreshed ltvs above 100 compared to approximately 0 at origination approximately 24 of home equity loans had fico scores less than 660 on a refreshed basis compared to 9 at origination

 home equity loans in billions of dollars 

  

  as evidenced by the table above the overall proportion of 90 days past due residential first mortgages with refreshed fico scores of less than 660 decreased year over year citi believes that the deterioration in these 90 days past due delinquency ratios from third to fourth quarter 2011 reflects the decline in citi’s asset sales of delinquent first mortgages the lengthening of the foreclosure process and the continued economic uncertainty as discussed in the sections above   although home equity loans are typically in junior lien positions and residential first mortgages are typically in a first lien position residential first mortgages historically have experienced higher delinquency rates as compared to home equity loans citi believes this difference is primarily due to the fact that residential first mortgages are written down to collateral value less cost to sell at 180 days past due and remain in the delinquency population until full disposition through sale repayment or foreclosure whereas home equity loans are generally fully charged off at 180 days past due and thus removed from the delinquency calculation in addition due to the longer timelines to foreclose on a residential first mortgage see “foreclosures” above these loans tend to remain in the delinquency statistics for a longer period and consequently the 90 days or more delinquencies of these mortgages remain higher   despite this historically higher level of delinquencies for residential first mortgages however home equity loan delinquencies have generally decreased at a slower rate than residential first mortgage delinquencies citi believes this difference is due primarily to the lack of a market to sell delinquent home equity loans and the relatively smaller number of home equity loan modifications which to date have been the primary drivers of citi’s first mortgage delinquency improvement see “north america consumer mortgage quarterly credit trends—delinquencies and net credit losses—residential first mortgages” above 

mortgage servicing rights to minimize credit and liquidity risk citi sells most of the mortgage loans it originates but retains the servicing rights these sale transactions create an intangible asset referred to as mortgage servicing rights msrs which are recorded at fair value on citi’s consolidated balance sheet the fair value of msrs is primarily affected by changes in prepayments of mortgages that result from shifts in mortgage interest rates specifically the fair value of msrs declines with increased prepayments and lower interest rates are generally one factor that tends to lead to increased prepayments in managing this risk citi economically hedges a significant portion of the value of its msrs through the use of interest rate derivative contracts forward purchase commitments of mortgagebacked securities and purchased securities classified as trading account assets    citi’s msrs totaled 2569 billion 2852 billion and 4554 billion at december 31 2011 september 30 2011 and december 31 2010 respectively the decrease in the value of citi’s msrs from year end 2010 to year end 2011 primarily represented the impact from lower interest rates in addition to amortization   for additional information on citi’s msrs see note 22 to the consolidated financial statements

consumer loan modification programs citi has instituted a variety of loan modification programs to assist its borrowers with financial difficulties under these programs the largest of which are predominately longterm modification programs targeted at residential first mortgage borrowers the original loan terms are modified substantially all of these programs incorporate some form of interest rate reduction other concessions may include reductions or waivers of accrued interest or fees loan tenor extensions andor the deferral or forgiveness of principal   loans modified under longterm modification programs as well as shortterm modifications originated since january 1 2011 that provide concessions to borrowers in financial difficulty are reported as troubled debt restructurings tdrs accordingly loans modified under the programs described below including modifications under shortterm programs since january 1 2011 are tdrs these tdrs are concentrated in the us see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of tdrs and note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the allowance for loan losses for these loans   a summary of citi’s more significant us modification programs follows 

residential first mortgages hamp the hamp is a longterm modification program designed to reduce monthly residential first mortgage payments to a 31 housing debt ratio monthly mortgage payment including property taxes insurance and homeowner dues divided by monthly gross income by lowering the interest rate extending the term of the loan and deferring or forgiving either on an absolute or contingent basis principal of certain eligible borrowers who have defaulted on their mortgages or who are at risk of imminent default due to economic hardship the interest rate reduction for residential first mortgages under hamp is in effect for five years and the rate then increases up to 1 per year until the interest rate cap the lower of the original rate or the freddie mac weekly primary mortgage market survey rate for a 30year fixed rate conforming loan as of the date of the modification is reached in order to be entitled to a hamp loan modification borrowers must provide the required documentation and complete a trial period generally three months by making the agreed payments   historically citi accounted for modifications under hamp as tdrs when the borrower successfully completed the trial period and the loan was permanently modified effective in the fourth quarter of 2011 trial modifications are reported as tdrs at the beginning of the trial period accordingly all loans in hamp trials as of the end of 2011 are reported as tdrs   citi supplemental the citi supplemental csm program is a longterm modification program designed to assist residential first mortgage borrowers ineligible for hamp or who become ineligible through the hamp trial period process if the borrower already has less than a 31 housing debt 

ratio the modification offered is an interest rate reduction up to 25 with a floor rate of 4 which is in effect for two years and the rate then increases up to 1 per year until the interest rate is at the premodified contractual rate if the borrower’s housing debt ratio is greater than 31 steps similar to those under hamp including potential interest rate reductions will be taken to achieve a 31 housing debt ratio the modified interest rate is in effect for two years and then increases up to 1 per year until the interest rate is at the premodified contractual rate three trial payments are required prior to modification which can be made during the trial period as in the case of hamp as discussed above all loans in csm trials as of the end of 2011 are reported as tdrs   fhava loans guaranteed by the fha or va are modified through the modification process required by those respective agencies and are longterm modification programs borrowers must be delinquent and concessions include interest rate reductions principal forgiveness extending maturity dates and forgiving accrued interest and late fees the interest rate reduction is in effect for the remaining loan term losses on fha loans are borne by the sponsoring agency provided that the insurance terms have not been rescinded as a result of an origination defect the va establishes a loanlevel loss cap beyond which citi is liable for loss historically citi’s losses on fha and va loans have been negligible   responsible lending citi’s responsible lending program is a longterm modification program designed to assist current residential first mortgage borrowers unable to refinance their loan due to negative equity in their home andor other borrower characteristics these loans are not eligible for modification under hamp or csm this program is designed to provide payment relief based on a floor interest rate by product type all adjustable rate and interest only loans are converted to fixed rate amortizing loans for the remaining mortgage term   cfna permanent mortgage adjustment of terms this longterm modification program is targeted to citifinancial’s part of citi holdings – lcl  consumer finance residential mortgage borrowers with a permanent hardship payment reduction is provided through the reamortization of the remaining loan balance typically at a lower interest rate modified loan tenors may not exceed a period of 480 months generally the rescheduled payment cannot be less than 50 of the original payment amount unless the adjustment of terms is a result of participation in the citifinancial home affordability modification program champ terminated august 2010 or as a result of settlement court order judgment or bankruptcy borrowers must make a qualifying payment at the reduced payment amount in order to qualify for the modification in addition borrowers must provide income and employment verification and monthly obligations are validated through an updated credit report 

  cfna temporary mortgage adjustment of terms this shortterm modification program is similar to the longterm program discussed above but is targeted to citifinancial’s consumer finance borrowers with a temporary hardship under this program which can include both an interest rate reduction and a term extension the interest rate is reduced for either a five or an elevenmonth period at the end of the temporary modification period the interest rate reverts to the premodification rate similar to the longterm program borrowers must make a payment at the reduced payment amount prior to the adjustment of terms being processed to qualify and they must meet the verification and validation requirements discussed above if the customer is still undergoing hardship at the conclusion of the temporary payment reduction an extension of the temporary terms can be considered in either of the time period increments above to a maximum of 24 months in cases where the account is over 60 days past due at the expiration of the temporary modification period the terms of the modification are made permanent and the payment is kept at the reduced amount for the remaining life of the loan 

credit cards credit card longterm modification programs citi’s longterm modification programs for its citibranded and retail partner cards borrowers are designed to liquidate a borrower’s balance within 60 months these programs are available to borrowers who indicate a longterm hardship payment requirements are decreased by reducing interest rates charged to either 99 or 0 depending on the borrower’s situation and are designed to fully amortize the balance under these programs fees are discontinued and charging privileges are permanently rescinded   universal payment program upp the upp is a shortterm cards modification program offered to citibranded and retail partner cards borrowers and provides shortterm interest rate reductions to assist borrowers experiencing temporary hardships under this program a participant’s apr is reduced by at least 500 basis points for a period of up to 12 months the minimum payment is established based upon the borrower’s specific circumstances and is designed to amortize at least 1 of the principal balance each month the participant’s apr returns to its original rate at the end of the program or earlier upon failure to make the required payments

consumer mortgage—representations and warranties the majority of citi’s exposure to representation and warranty claims relates to its us consumer mortgage business within citimortgage 

citimortgage servicing portfolio as of december 31 2011 citi services loans previously sold to the us government sponsored entities gses and private investors as follows 

    as previously disclosed during the period 2005 through 2008 citi sold approximately 25 billion of loans through privatelabel residential mortgage securitizations as of december 31 2011 approximately 11 billion of the 25 billion remained outstanding as a result of repayments of approximately 13 billion and cumulative losses incurred by the issuing trusts of approximately 1 billion the remaining 11 billion outstanding is included in the 396 billion of serviced loans above as of december 31 2011 the amount that remained outstanding had a 90 days or more delinquency rate in the aggregate of approximately 129 for information on litigation related to these and other citi securitization activities see “ securities and banking sponsored privatelabel residential mortgage securitizations—representations and warranties” below and note 29 to the consolidated financial statements 

representations and warranties when selling a loan citi makes various representations and warranties relating to among other things the following 

citi’s ownership of the loan the validity of the lien securing the loan the absence of delinquent taxes or liens against the property securing the loan the effectiveness of title insurance on the property securing the loan the process used in selecting the loans for inclusion in a transaction the loan’s compliance with any applicable loan criteria established by the buyer and the loan’s compliance with applicable local state and federal laws   the specific representations and warranties made by citi depend on the nature of the transaction and the requirements of the buyer market conditions and creditrating agency requirements may also affect representations and warranties and the other provisions to which citi may agree in loan sales 

repurchases or “makewhole” payments in the event of a breach of these representations and warranties citi may be required to either repurchase the mortgage loans with the identified defects generally at unpaid principal balance plus accrued interest or indemnify “makewhole” the investors for their losses citi’s representations and warranties are generally not subject to stated limits in amount or time of coverage   similar to 2010 during 2011 issues related to i misrepresentation of facts by either the borrower or a third party eg income employment debts fico etc ii appraisal issues eg an error or misrepresentation of value and iii program requirements eg a loan that does not meet investor guidelines such as contractual interest rate have been the primary drivers of citi’s repurchases and makewhole payments however the type of defect that results in a repurchase or makewhole payment has continued and will continue to vary over time more importantly there has not been a meaningful difference in citi’s incurred or estimated loss for any particular type of defect   in the case of a repurchase citi will bear any subsequent credit loss on the mortgage loan and the loan is typically considered a creditimpaired loan and accounted for under sop 033 “accounting for certain loans and debt securities acquired in a transfer” now incorporated into asc 31030 receivables—loans and debt securities acquired with deteriorated credit quality  these repurchases have not had a material impact on citi’s nonperforming loan statistics because creditimpaired purchased sop 033 loans are not included in nonaccrual loans since they generally continue to accrue interest until writeoff 

  the unpaid principal balance of loans repurchased due to representation and warranty claims for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively was as follows 

   as evidenced in the tables above citi’s repurchases have primarily been from the gses in addition to the amounts set forth in the tables above citi recorded makewhole payments of 530 million and 310 million for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively 

repurchase reserve citi has recorded a reserve for its exposure to losses from the obligation to repurchase or makewhole payments in respect of previously sold loans referred to as the repurchase reserve that is included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet in estimating the repurchase reserve citi considers reimbursements estimated to be received from thirdparty correspondent lenders and indemnification agreements relating to previous acquisitions of mortgage servicing rights the estimated reimbursements are based on citi’s analysis of its most recent collection trends and the financial solvency of the correspondents   in the case of a repurchase of a creditimpaired sop 033 loan the difference between the loan’s fair value and unpaid principal balance at the time of the repurchase is recorded as a utilization of the repurchase reserve makewhole payments to the investor are also treated as utilizations and charged directly against the reserve the repurchase reserve is estimated when citi sells loans recorded as an adjustment to the gain on sale which is included in other revenue in the consolidated statement of income and is updated quarterly any change in estimate is recorded in other revenue    the repurchase reserve is calculated by individual sales vintage ie the year the loans were sold during 2011 the majority of citi’s repurchases continued to be from the 2006 through 2008 sales vintages which also represented the vintages with the largest loss severity an insignificant percentage of repurchases have been from vintages prior to 2006 and citi continues to believe that this percentage will continue to decrease as those vintages are later in the credit cycle although still early in the credit cycle citi continued to experience lower repurchases and loss per repurchase or makewhole from post2008 sales vintages 

  the repurchase reserve is based on various assumptions these assumptions contain a level of uncertainty and risk that if different from actual results could have a material impact on the reserve amounts see “sensitivity of repurchase reserve” below the most significant assumptions used to calculate the reserve levels are as follows 

loan documentation requests assumptions regarding future expected loan documentation requests exist as a means to predict future repurchase claim trends these assumptions are based on recent historical trends in loan documentation requests recent trends in historical delinquencies forecasted delinquencies and general industry knowledge about the current repurchase environment during 2011 the actual number of loan documentation requests declined as compared to 2010 however because such requests remain elevated from historical levels and because of the continued increased focus on mortgagerelated matters the assumption for estimated future loan documentation requests increased during 2011 citi currently believes the level of actual loan documentation requests will remain elevated from historical levels and will continue to be volatile   repurchase claims as a percentage of loan documentation requests given that loan documentation requests are a potential indicator of future repurchase claims an assumption is made regarding the conversion rate from loan documentation requests to repurchase claims which assumption is based on historical performance during 2011 the conversion rate or the number of repurchase claims as a percentage of loan documentation requests increased as compared to 2010 and thus the assumption regarding future repurchase claims also increased citi currently believes the claims as a percentage of loan documentation requests will remain at elevated levels   claims appeal success rate this assumption represents citi’s expected success at rescinding a claim by satisfying the demand for more information disputing the claim validity or similar matters this assumption is based on recent historical successful appeals rates which can fluctuate based on changes in the validity or composition of claims during 2011 citi’s appeal success rate remained stable as compared to 2010 meaning approximately half of the repurchase claims were successfully appealed and resulted in no loss to citi   estimated loss per repurchase or makewhole the assumption of the estimated loss per repurchase or makewhole payment is based on actual and estimated losses of recent historical repurchasesmakewhole payments calculated for each sales vintage year in order to capture volatile housing price highs and lows the estimated loss per repurchase or makewhole payment assumption is also impacted by estimates of loan size at the time of repurchase or makewhole payment during 2011 the severity of losses increased slightly as compared to 2010 but was more than offset by the reduction in loan size resulting in a decline in the actual loss per repurchase or makewhole payment citi would expect to continue to see reductions in loan size including for the 2006 to 2008 sales vintages as the loans continue to amortize through the loan cycle 

  in sum the increase in estimated future loan documentation requests and repurchase claims as a percentage of loan documentation requests were the primary drivers of the 948 million increase in estimate for the repurchase reserve during 2011 these factors were also the primary drivers of the 305 million increase in estimate during the fourth quarter of 2011 

the table below sets forth the activity in the repurchase reserve for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 

   the activity in the repurchase reserve for the three months ended december 31 2011 was as follows 



sensitivity of repurchase reserve as discussed above the repurchase reserve estimation process is subject to numerous estimates and judgments the assumptions used to calculate the repurchase reserve contain a level of uncertainty and risk that if different from actual results could have a material impact on the reserve amounts for example citi estimates that if there were a simultaneous 10 adverse change in each of the significant assumptions noted above the repurchase reserve would increase by approximately 620 million as of december 31 2011 this potential change is hypothetical and intended to indicate the sensitivity of the repurchase reserve to changes in the key assumptions actual changes in the key assumptions may not occur at the same time or to the same degree ie an adverse change in one assumption may be offset by an improvement in another citi does not believe it has sufficient information to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss as defined under asc 450 relating to its consumer representations and warranties 

representation and warranty claims—by claimant for the gses citi’s response ie agree or disagree to repurchase or makewhole to any repurchase claim is required within 90 days of receipt of the claim if citi does not respond within 90 days the claim is subject to discussions between citi and the particular gse for private investors the time period for responding to any repurchase claim is governed by the individual sale agreement however if the specified timeframe is exceeded the investor may choose to initiate legal action as of december 31 2011 no such legal action has been initiated by private investors   the representation and warranty claims by claimant as well as the number of unresolved claims by claimant for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively were as follows

securities and banking sponsored legacy privatelabel residential mortgage securitizations—representations and warranties 

overview citi is also exposed to representation and warranty claims through residential mortgage securitizations that had been sponsored by citi’s sb business however sb sponsored legacy securitizations have represented a much smaller portion of citi’s business than citi’s consumer residential mortgage business discussed above   as previously disclosed during the period 2005 through 2008 sb had sponsored approximately 665 billion in legacy privatelabel mortgagebacked securitization transactions that were backed by loan collateral composed of approximately 155 billion prime 124 billion alta and 386 billion subprime residential mortgage loans as of december 31 2011 approximately 234 billion of this amount remains outstanding as a result of repayments of approximately 345 billion and cumulative losses incurred by the issuing trusts of approximately 87 billion of which approximately 66 billion related to subprime loans of the amount remaining outstanding approximately 61 billion is backed by prime residential mortgage collateral at origination approximately 49 billion by alta and approximately 123 billion by subprime as of december 31 2011 the 234 billion remaining outstanding had a 90 days or more delinquency rate of approximately 272   the mortgages included in these securitizations were purchased from parties outside of citi fewer than 2 of the mortgages underlying the transactions outstanding as of december 31 2011 were originated by citi in addition fewer than 10 of the mortgages are serviced by citi the mortgages serviced by citi are included in the 396 billion of residential mortgage loans referenced under “consumer mortgage—representations and warranties” above 

representation and warranties in connection with these securitization transactions representations and warranties representations relating to the mortgages included in each trust issuing the securities were made either by citi by thirdparty sellers selling entities which were also often the originators of the loans or both these representations were generally made or assigned to the issuing trust and related to among other things the following 

the absence of fraud on the part of the borrower the seller or any appraiser broker or other party involved in the origination of the mortgage which was sometimes wholly or partially limited to the knowledge of the representation provider whether the mortgage property was occupied by the borrower as his or her principal residence the mortgage’s compliance with applicable federal state and local laws whether the mortgage was originated in conformity with the originator’s underwriting guidelines and detailed data concerning the mortgages that were included on the mortgage loan schedule 

  the specific representations relating to the mortgages in each securitization varied however depending on various factors such as the selling entity rating agency requirements and whether the mortgages were considered prime alta or subprime in credit quality   in the event of a breach of its representations citi may be required either to repurchase the mortgage with the identified defects generally at unpaid principal balance plus accrued interest or indemnify the investors for their losses through makewhole payments for securitizations in which citi made representations citi generally also received from the selling entities similar representations with the exception of certain limited representations required by among others the rating agencies in cases where citi made representations and also received the same representations from the selling entity for a particular loan if citi receives a claim based on breach of those representations in respect of the loan it may have a contractual right to pursue a similar backtoback claim against the selling entity see discussion below if only the selling entity made representations with respect to a particular loan then only the selling entity should be responsible for a claim based on breach of the representations   for the majority of the securitizations where citi made representations and received similar representations from selling entities citi currently believes that with respect to the securitizations backed by prime and alta collateral if it received a repurchase claim for those loans it would have backtoback claims against the selling entities that the selling entities would likely be in a position to honor however for the significant majority of the subprime collateral where citi has backtoback claims against selling entities citi believes that those selling entities would be unlikely to honor backtoback claims because they are in bankruptcy liquidation or financial distress in those situations in the event that claims for breaches of representations were made against citi the selling entities’ financial condition might preclude citi from obtaining backtoback recoveries from them   to date citi has received actual claims for breaches of representations relating to only a small percentage of the mortgages included in these securitization transactions although the pace of claims remains volatile and has recently increased citi has also experienced an increase in the level of inquiries assertions and requests for loan files among other matters relating to the above securitization transactions from trustees of securitization trusts and others trustee activities have been prompted in part by lawsuits and other actions by investors given the continued increased focus on mortgagerelated matters as well as the increasing level of litigation and regulatory activity relating to mortgage loans and mortgagebacked securities the level of inquiries and assertions regarding these securitizations may further increase these inquiries and assertions could lead to actual claims for breaches of representations or to litigation relating to such breaches or other matters for information on litigation claims and regulatory proceedings regarding these and other sb mortgagerelated activities see note 29 to the consolidated financial statements

joint business and independent risk management responsibility for managing credit risks a single center of control for each credit relationship that coordinates credit activities with that client portfolio limits to ensure diversification and maintain riskcapital alignment a minimum of two authorized credit officer signatures required on extensions of credit one of which must be from a credit officer in credit risk management risk rating standards applicable to every obligor and facility and consistent standards for credit origination documentation and remedial management 

corporate credit portfolio the following table represents the corporate credit portfolio excluding private banking before consideration of collateral by maturity at december 31 2011 the corporate portfolio is broken out by direct outstandings which include drawn loans overdrafts interbank placements bankers’ acceptances and leases and unfunded commitments which include unused commitments to lend letters of credit and financial guarantees 

 portfolio mix citi’s corporate credit portfolio is diverse across geography and counterparty the following table shows the percentage of direct outstandings and unfunded commitments by region 

   the maintenance of accurate and consistent risk ratings across the corporate credit portfolio facilitates the comparison of credit exposure across all lines of business geographic regions and products   obligor risk ratings reflect an estimated probability of default for an obligor and are derived primarily through the use of validated statistical models scorecard models and external agency ratings under defined circumstances in combination with consideration of factors specific to the obligor or market such as management experience competitive position and regulatory environment facility risk ratings are assigned that reflect 

the probability of default of the obligor and factors that affect the lossgiven default of the facility such as support or collateral internal obligor ratings that generally correspond to bbb and above are considered investment grade while those below are considered noninvestment grade   citigroup also has incorporated climate risk assessment criteria for certain obligors as necessary factors evaluated include consideration of climate risk to an obligor’s business and physical assets   the following table presents the corporate credit portfolio by facility risk rating at december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 as a percentage of the total portfolio 

 

  citi’s corporate credit portfolio is also diversified by industry with a concentration in the financial sector broadly defined including banks other financial institutions insurance companies investment banks and government and central banks the following table shows the allocation of direct outstandings and unfunded commitments to industries as a percentage of the total corporate portfolio 

  credit risk mitigation as part of its overall risk management activities citigroup uses credit derivatives and other risk mitigants to hedge portions of the credit risk in its corporate credit portfolio in addition to outright asset sales the purpose of these transactions is to transfer credit risk to third parties the results of the mark to market and any realized gains or losses on credit derivatives are reflected in the principal transactions line on the consolidated statement of income 

  at december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 415 billion and 490 billion respectively of credit risk exposures were economically hedged citigroup’s expected loss model used in the calculation of its loan loss reserve does not include the favorable impact of credit derivatives and other mitigants that are marked to market in addition the reported amounts of direct outstandings and unfunded commitments above do not reflect the impact of these hedging transactions at december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 the credit protection was economically hedging underlying credit exposure with the following risk rating distribution respectively

exposure to commercial real estate icg and the sap  through their business activities and as capital markets participants incur exposures that are directly or indirectly tied to the commercial real estate cre market and each of lcl and gcb hold loans that are collateralized by cre these exposures are represented primarily by the following three categories   1 assets held at fair value included approximately 55 billion at december 31 2011 of which approximately 40 billion are securities loans and other items linked to cre that are carried at fair value as trading account assets  approximately 11 billion are securities backed by cre carried at fair value as availableforsale afs investments and approximately 04 billion are other exposures classified as other assets changes in fair value for these trading account assets are reported in current earnings while for afs investments change in fair value are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income with creditrelated otherthantemporary impairments reported in current earnings   the majority of these exposures are classified as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy over the last several years weakened activity in the trading markets for some of these instruments resulted in reduced liquidity thereby decreasing the observable inputs for such valuations and could continue to have an adverse impact on how these instruments are valued in the future see note 25 to the consolidated financial statements   2 assets held at amortized cost include approximately 12 billion of securities classified as heldtomaturity htm and approximately 262 billion of loans and commitments each as of december 31 2011 htm securities are accounted for at amortized cost subject to an otherthantemporary impairment evaluation loans and commitments are recorded at amortized cost the impact of changes in credit is reflected in the calculation of the allowance for loan losses and in net credit losses   3 equity and other investments include approximately 36 billion of equity and other investments such as limited partner fund investments at december 31 2011 that are accounted for under the equity method which recognizes gains or losses based on the investor’s share of the net income loss of the investee 

  the following table provides a summary of citigroup’s global cre funded and unfunded exposures at december 31 2011 and 2010 

   the above table represents the vast majority of citi’s direct exposure to cre there may be other transactions that have indirect exposures to cre that are not reflected in this table 

market risk market risk losses arise from fluctuations in the market value of trading and nontrading positions including the changes in value resulting from fluctuations in rates market risk encompasses liquidity risk and price risk both of which arise in the normal course of business of a global financial intermediary for a discussion of funding and liquidity risk see “capital resources and liquidity—funding and liquidity” above price risk is the earnings risk from changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates equity and commodity prices and in their implied volatilities price risk arises in nontrading portfolios as well as in trading portfolios   market risks are measured in accordance with established standards to ensure consistency across businesses and the ability to aggregate risk each business is required to establish with approval from citi’s market risk management a market risk limit framework for identified risk factors that clearly defines approved risk profiles and is within the parameters of citi’s overall risk tolerance these limits are monitored by independent market risk country and business asset and liability committees and the global finance and asset and liability committee in all cases the businesses are ultimately responsible for the market risks taken and for remaining within their defined limits 

price risk—nontrading portfolios net interest revenue and interest rate risk one of citi’s primary business functions is providing financial products that meet the needs of its customers loans and deposits are tailored to the customers’ requirements with regard to tenor index if applicable and rate type net interest revenue nir for interest rate exposure ire purposes is the difference between the yield earned on the nontrading portfolio assets including customer loans and the rate paid on the liabilities including customer deposits or company borrowings nir is affected by changes in the level of interest rates for example 

at any given time there may be an unequal amount of assets and liabilities that are subject to market rates due to maturation or repricing whenever the amount of liabilities subject to repricing exceeds the amount of assets subject to repricing a company is considered “liability sensitive” in this case a company’s nir will deteriorate in a rising rate environment the assets and liabilities of a company may reprice at different speeds or mature at different times subjecting both “liabilitysensitive” and “asset sensitive” companies to nir sensitivity from changing interest rates for example a company may have a large amount of loans that are subject to repricing in the current period but the majority of deposits are not scheduled for repricing until the following period that company would suffer from nir deterioration if interest rates were to fall   nir in any particular period is the result of customer transactions and the related contractual rates originated in prior periods as well as new transactions in the current period those priorperiod transactions will be impacted by changes in rates on floatingrate assets and liabilities in the current period 

  due to the longterm nature of portfolios nir will vary from quarter to quarter even assuming no change in the shape or level of the yield curve as assets and liabilities reprice these repricings are a function of implied forward interest rates which represent the overall market’s estimate of future interest rates and incorporate possible changes in the federal funds rate as well as the shape of the yield curve 

interest rate risk measurement citi’s principal measure of risk to nir is interest rate exposure ire ire measures the change in expected nir in each currency resulting solely from unanticipated changes in forward interest rates factors such as changes in volumes credit spreads margins and the impact of priorperiod pricing decisions are not captured by ire ire also assumes that businesses make no additional changes in pricing or balances in response to the unanticipated rate changes   for example if the current 90day libor rate is 3 and the oneyearforward rate ie the estimated 90day libor rate in one year is 5 the 100 bps ire scenario measures the impact on the company’s nir of a 100 bps instantaneous change in the 90day libor to 6 in one year   the impact of changing prepayment rates on loan portfolios is incorporated into the results for example in the declining interest rate scenarios it is assumed that mortgage portfolios prepay faster and income is reduced in addition in a rising interest rate scenario portions of the deposit portfolio are assumed to experience rate increases that may be less than the change in market interest rates 

mitigation and hedging of risk in order to manage changes in interest rates effectively citi may modify pricing on new customer loans and deposits enter into transactions with other institutions or enter into offbalancesheet derivative transactions that have the opposite risk exposures citi regularly assesses the viability of these and other strategies to reduce its interest rate risks and implements such strategies when it believes those actions are prudent   citigroup employs additional measurements including stress testing the impact of nonlinear interest rate movements on the value of the balance sheet the analysis of portfolio duration and volatility particularly as they relate to mortgage loans and mortgagebacked securities and the potential impact of the change in the spread between different market indices 

nontrading portfolios—ire the exposures in the following table represent the approximate annualized risk to nir assuming an unanticipated parallel instantaneous 100 bps change as well as a more gradual 100 bps 25 bps per quarter parallel change in interest rates compared with the market forward interest rates in selected currencies 

    the changes in the us dollar ire year over year reflected revised modeling of mortgages and the impact of lower rates asset sales swapping activities and repositioning of the liquidity portfolio   the following table shows the risk to nir from six different changes in the impliedforward rates each scenario assumes that the rate change will occur on a gradual basis every three months over the course of one year

price risk—trading portfolios price risk in citi’s trading portfolios is monitored using a series of measures including but not limited to 

value at risk var stress testing factor sensitivities   each trading portfolio across citi’s business segments citicorp citi holdings and corporateother has its own market risk limit framework encompassing these measures and other controls including permitted product lists and a new product approval process for complex products 

  all trading positions are marked to market with the result reflected in earnings in 2011 negative tradingrelated revenue net losses was recorded for 54 of 260 trading days of the 54 days on which negative revenue net losses was recorded 1 day was greater than 180 million   the following histogram of total daily trading revenue loss captures trading volatility and shows the number of days in which citi’s var tradingrelated revenues fell within particular ranges a substantial portion of the volatility relating to citi’s total daily trading revenue var is driven by changes in cva on citi’s derivative assets net of cva hedges 

 97 

value at risk value at risk var estimates at a 99 confidence level the potential decline in the value of a position or a portfolio under normal market conditions var statistics can be materially different across firms due to differences in portfolio composition differences in var methodologies and differences in model parameters citi believes var statistics can be used more effectively as indicators of trends in risk taking within a firm rather than as a basis for inferring differences in risk taking across firms   citi uses monte carlo simulation which it believes is conservatively calibrated to incorporate the greater of shortterm most recent month and longterm three years market volatility the monte carlo simulation involves approximately 300000 market factors making use of 180000 time series with market factors updated daily and model parameters updated weekly   the conservative features of the var calibration contribute approximately 20 addon to what would be a var estimated under the assumption of stable and perfectly normally distributed markets under normal and stable market conditions citi would thus expect the number of days where trading losses exceed its var to be less than two or three exceptions per year periods of unstable market conditions could increase the number of these exceptions during the last four quarters there was one backtesting exception where trading losses exceeded the var estimate at the citigroup level backtesting is the process in which the daily var of a portfolio is compared to the actual daily change in the market value of transactions this occurred on august 8 2011 after the us government rating was downgraded by sp   the table below summarizes var for citiwide trading portfolios at and during 2011 and 2010 including quarterly averages historically citi included only the hedges associated with the cva of its derivative transactions in its var calculations and disclosures these hedges were and continue to be included within the relevant risk type eg interest rate foreign exchange equity etc however citi now includes both the hedges associated with the cva of its derivatives and the cva on the derivative counterparty exposure included in the line “incremental impact of derivative cva” the inclusion of the cva on derivative counterparty exposure reduces citi’s total trading var citi believes this calculation and presentation reflect a more complete and accurate view of its marktomarket risk profile as it incorporates both the cva underlying derivative transactions and related hedges   for comparison purposes citi has included in the table below i total var the specific riskonly component of var and the isolated general market factor var each as reported previously ie including only hedges associated with the cva of its derivatives counterparty exposures ii the incremental impact of adding in the derivative counterparty cva and iii the total trading and cva var 

  as set forth in the table below citi’s total trading and cva var was 183 million at december 31 2011 and 186 million at december 31 2010 daily total trading and cva var averaged 189 million in 2011 and ranged from 135 million to 255 million prior period information is not available for comparability purposes the change in total trading and cva var year over year was driven by a reduction in citi’s trading exposures across sb  particularly in the latter part of the year offset by an increase in market volatility and an increase in cva exposures and associated hedges 

 

  the table below provides the range of market factor vars inclusive of specific risk that was experienced during 2011 and 2010 

   the following table provides the var for sb during 2011 excluding the cva relating to derivative counterparties cva and hedges of cva 

 

stress testing stress testing is performed on trading portfolios on a regular basis to estimate the impact of extreme market movements it is performed on both individual trading portfolios and on aggregations of portfolios and businesses independent market risk management in conjunction with the businesses develops both systemic and specific stress scenarios reviews the output of periodic stresstesting exercises and uses the information to make judgments as to the ongoing appropriateness of exposure levels and limits 

factor sensitivities factor sensitivities are expressed as the change in the value of a position for a defined change in a market risk factor such as a change in the value of a treasury bill for a onebasispoint change in interest rates citi’s independent market risk management ensures that factor sensitivities are calculated monitored and in most cases limited for all relevant risks taken in a trading portfolio 

   as described under “market risk” above a significant portion of citi’s business activities are based upon gathering deposits and borrowing money and then lending or investing those funds or participating in marketmaking activities in tradable securities citi’s net interest margin nim is calculated by dividing gross interest revenue less gross interest expense by average interest earning assets 

  during 2011 citi’s nim declined as compared to the prior year decreasing by approximately 26 basis points primarily driven by the continued runoff and sales of higheryielding assets in citi holdings and lower investment yields driven by the continued low interest rate environment partially offset by the growth of loweryielding loans in citicorp and lower borrowing costs eg substituting maturing longterm debt with deposits as a funding source absent any significant changes or events eg a significant portfolio sale in citi holdings citi expects nim will likely continue to reflect the pressure of a low interest rate environment but should generally stabilize around endofyear2011 levels

operational risk operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes systems or human factors or from external events it includes the reputation and franchise risk associated with business practices or market conduct in which citi is involved operational risk is inherent in citigroup’s global business activities and as with other risk types is managed through an overall framework designed to balance strong corporate oversight with welldefined independent risk management this framework includes 

recognized ownership of the risk by the businesses oversight by citi’s independent risk management and independent review by citi’s audit and risk review arr   the goal is to keep operational risk at appropriate levels relative to the characteristics of citigroup’s businesses the markets in which it operates its capital and liquidity and the competitive economic and regulatory environment notwithstanding these controls citigroup incurs operational losses 

framework to monitor mitigate and control operational risk citigroup maintains a system of comprehensive policies and has established a consistent framework for assessing and communicating operational risk and the overall effectiveness of the internal control environment across citigroup an operational risk council provides oversight for operational risk across citigroup the council’s membership includes senior members of the chief risk officer’s organization covering multiple dimensions of risk management with representatives of the business and regional chief risk officers’ organizations and the business management group see “managing global risk—risk management—overview” above the council’s focus is on identification and mitigation of operational risk and related incidents the council works with the business segments and the control functions with the objective of ensuring a transparent consistent and comprehensive framework for managing operational risk globally   each major business segment must implement an operational risk process consistent with the requirements of this framework the process for operational risk management includes the following steps 

identify and assess key operational risks establish key risk indicators produce a comprehensive operational risk report and prioritize and assure adequate resources to actively improve the operational risk environment and mitigate emerging risks   the operational risk standards facilitate the effective communication and mitigation of operational risk both within and across businesses as new products and business activities are developed processes are designed modified or sourced through alternative means and operational risks are considered enterprise risk management a newly formed organization within citi’s independent risk management proactively assists the businesses operations and technology and the other independent control groups in enhancing the effectiveness of controls and managing operational risks across products business lines and regions 

  information about the businesses’ operational risk historical losses and the control environment is reported by each major business segment and functional area and is summarized and reported to senior management as well as the risk management and finance committee of citi’s board of directors and the full board of directors 

measurement and basel ii to support advanced capital modeling and management the businesses are required to capture relevant operational risk capital information a risk capital model for operational risk has been developed and implemented across the major business segments as a step toward readiness for basel ii capital calculations the risk capital calculation is designed to qualify as an “advanced measurement approach” under basel ii it uses a combination of internal and external loss data to support statistical modeling of capital requirement estimates which are then adjusted to reflect qualitative data regarding the operational risk and control environment 

information security and continuity of business information security and the protection of confidential and sensitive customer data are a priority for citigroup citi has implemented an information security program in accordance with the grammleachbliley act and regulatory guidance the information security program is reviewed and enhanced periodically to address emerging threats to customers’ information   the corporate office of business continuity with the support of senior management continues to coordinate global preparedness and mitigate business continuity risks by reviewing and testing recovery procedures 

country and crossborder risk 

country risk country risk is the risk that an event in a country precipitated by developments within or external to a country will impair the value of citi’s franchise or will adversely affect the ability of obligors within that country to honor their obligations to citi country risk events may include sovereign defaults banking defaults or crises currency crises andor political events see also “risk factors—market and economic risks” above   the information below is based on citi’s internal risk management measures the country designation in citi’s risk management systems is based on the country to which the client relationship taken as a whole is most directly exposed to economic financial sociopolitical or legal risks this includes exposure to subsidiaries within the client relationship that are domiciled outside of the country 

  citi assesses the risk of loss associated with certain of the country exposures on a regular basis these analyses take into consideration alternative scenarios that may unfold as well as specific characteristics of citi’s portfolio such as transaction structure and collateral citi currently believes that the risk of loss associated with the exposures set forth below is likely materially lower than the exposure amounts disclosed below and is sized appropriately relative to its franchise in these countries for additional information relating to citi’s risk management practices see “managing global risk” above   the sovereign entities of all the countries disclosed below as well as the financial institutions and corporations domiciled in these countries are important clients in the global citi franchise citi fully expects to maintain its presence in these markets to service all of its global customers as such citi’s exposure in these countries may vary over time based upon its franchise client needs and transaction structures 

giips and france several european countries including greece ireland italy portugal spain and france have been the subject of credit deterioration due to weaknesses in their economic and fiscal situations given investor interest in this area the table below sets forth citi’s exposures to these countries as of december 31 2011 

  107 

giips gross funded credit exposure to the sovereign entities of greece ireland italy portugal and spain giips as well as financial institutions and multinational and local corporations designated in these countries under citi’s risk management systems was 202 billion at december 31 2011 the 202 billion of gross credit exposure was made up of 94 billion in funded loans before reserves and 108 billion in derivative counterparty marktomarket exposure inclusive of credit valuation adjustments the derivative counterparty marktomarket exposure includes the net credit exposure arising from secured financing transactions such as repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements see “secured financing transactions” below   as of december 31 2011 citi’s net current funded exposure to the giips sovereigns financial institutions and corporations was 77 billion included in the 77 billion net current funded exposure was 13 billion of net trading and availableforsale securities exposure and 64 billion of net current funded credit exposure each component is described below in more detail 

net trading and afs exposure  13 billion included in the net current funded exposure at december 31 2011 was a net position of 13 billion in securities and derivatives with the giips sovereigns financial institutions and corporations as the issuer or reference entity which are held in citi’s trading and afs portfolios these portfolios are marked to market daily and as previously disclosed citi’s trading exposure levels vary as it maintains inventory consistent with customer needs 

net current funded credit exposure  64 billion as of december 31 2011 the net current funded credit exposure to the giips sovereigns financial institutions and corporations was 64 billion exposures were 07 billion to sovereigns 16 billion to financial institutions and 41 billion to corporations   consistent with citi’s internal risk management measures and as set forth in the table above net current funded credit exposure has been reduced by 43 billion of margin posted under legally enforceable margin agreements and collateral pledged under bankruptcyremote structures at december 31 2011 the majority of this margin and collateral was in the form of cash with the remainder in predominantly nongiips nonfrench securities which are included at fair value   net current funded credit exposure also reflects a reduction for 96 billion in purchased credit protection predominantly from financial institutions outside the giips and france such protection generally pays out only upon the occurrence of certain credit events with respect to the country or borrower covered by the protection as determined by a committee composed of dealers and other market participants in addition to counterparty credit risks see “credit default swaps” below the credit protection may not fully cover all situations that may adversely affect the value of citi’s exposure and accordingly citi could still experience losses despite the existence of the credit protection 

unfunded commitments—73 billion as of december 31 2011 citi also had 73 billion of unfunded commitments to the giips sovereigns financial institutions and corporations with 67 billion of this amount to corporations these unfunded lines generally have standard conditions that must be met before they can be drawn 

other activities like other banks citi also provides settlement and clearing facilities for a variety of clients in these countries and actively monitors and manages these intraday exposures in addition at december 31 2011 citi had approximately 74 billion of locally funded exposure in the giips generally to retail customers and small businesses as part of its local lending activities the vast majority of this exposure is in citi holdings spain and greece 

france gross funded credit exposure to the french sovereign financial institutions and corporations was 117 billion at december 31 2011 the 117 billion of gross credit exposure was made up of 47 billion in funded loans before reserves and 70 billion in derivative counterparty marktomarket exposure inclusive of credit valuation adjustments the derivative counterparty marktomarket exposure includes the net credit exposure arising from secured financing transactions such as repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements see “secured financing transactions” below   as of december 31 2011 citi’s net current funded exposure to the french sovereign financial institutions and corporations was 19 billion included in the 19 billion net current funded exposure was 06 billion of net trading and availableforsale securities exposure and 13 billion of net current funded credit exposure each component is described below in more detail 

net trading and afs exposure  06 billion included in the net current funded exposure at december 31 2011 was a net position of 06 billion in securities and derivatives with the french sovereign financial institutions and corporations as the issuer or reference entity which are held in citi’s trading and afs portfolios these portfolios are marked to market daily and as previously disclosed citi’s trading exposure levels vary as it maintains inventory consistent with customer needs 

net current funded credit exposure  13 billion as of december 31 2011 the net current funded credit exposure to the french sovereign financial institutions and corporations was 13 billion exposures were 19 billion to financial institutions and 06 billion to corporations   consistent with citi’s internal risk management measures and as set forth in the table above net current funded credit exposure has been reduced by 53 billion of margin posted under legally enforceable margin agreements and collateral pledged under bankruptcyremote structures as of december 31 2011 the majority of this margin and collateral was in the form of cash with the remainder in nongiips nonfrench securities which are included at fair value 

  net current funded credit exposure also reflects a reduction for 51 billion in purchased credit protection predominantly from financial institutions outside giips and france such protection generally pays out only upon the occurrence of certain credit events with respect to the country or borrower covered by the protection as determined by a committee composed of dealers and other market participants in addition to counterparty credit risks see “credit default swaps” below the credit protection may not fully cover all situations that may adversely affect the value of citi’s exposure and accordingly citi could still experience losses despite the existence of the credit protection 

unfunded commitments—161 billion as of december 31 2011 citi also had 161 billion of unfunded commitments to the french sovereign financial institutions and corporations with 119 billion of this amount to corporations these unfunded lines generally have standard conditions that must be met before they can be drawn 

other activities similar to other banks citi also provides settlement and clearing facilities for a variety of clients in france and actively monitors and manages these intraday exposures citi also has locally funded exposure in france however as of december 31 2011 the amount of this exposure was not material 

credit default swaps citi buys and sells credit protection through credit default swaps on underlying giips or french entities as part of its marketmaking activities for clients in its trading portfolios citi also purchases credit protection through credit default swaps to hedge its own credit exposure to these underlying entities that arises from loans to these entities or derivative transactions with these entities   citi buys and sells credit default swaps as part of its marketmaking activity and purchases credit default swaps for credit protection with financial institutions that citi believes are of high quality the counterparty credit exposure that can arise from the purchase or sale of credit default swaps is usually covered by legally enforceable netting and margining agreements with a given counterparty so that the credit exposure to that counterparty is measured and managed in aggregate across all products covered by a given netting or margining agreement   the notional amount of credit protection purchased or sold on giips or french underlying single reference entities as of december 31 2011 is set forth in the table below the net notional contract amounts less marktomarket adjustments are included in “net current funded exposure” in the table under “giips and france” above and appear in either “net trading exposure” when part of a trading strategy or in “purchased credit protection” when purchased as a hedge against a credit exposure see note 1 to the table below 

  109 

  when citi purchases credit default swaps as a hedge against a credit exposure citi generally seeks to purchase products with a maturity date similar to the exposure against which the protection is purchased while certain exposures may have longer maturities that extend beyond the credit default swap tenors readily available in the market citi generally will purchase credit protection with a maximum tenor that is readily available in the market   the above table contains all net credit default swaps cdss purchased or sold on giips or french underlying entities whether part of a trading strategy or as purchased credit protection with respect to the 169 billion net purchased cds contracts on underlying giips reference entities approximately 89 has been purchased from nongiips counterparties with respect to the 104 billion net purchased cds contracts on underlying french reference entities approximately 72 has been purchased from nonfrench counterparties the net credit exposure to any counterparties arising from these transactions including any giips or french counterparties is managed and mitigated through legally enforceable netting and margining agreements when citi purchases credit default swaps as a hedge against a credit exposure it generally seeks to purchase products from counterparties that would not be correlated with the underlying credit exposure it is hedging 

secured financing transactions   as part of its banking activities with its clients citi enters into secured financing transactions such as repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements these transactions typically involve the lending of cash against which securities are taken as collateral the amount of cash loaned against the securities collateral is a function of the liquidity and quality of the collateral as well as the credit quality of the counterparty the collateral is typically marked to market daily and citi has the ability to call for additional collateral usually in the form of cash if the value of the securities falls below a predefined threshold   as of december 31 2011 citi had loaned 192 billion in cash through secured financing transactions with giips or french counterparties usually through reverse repurchase agreements as shown in the table below against those loans it held approximately 212 billion fair value of securities collateral as well as 11 billion in variation margin most of which was in cash   consistent with citi’s risk management systems secured financing transactions are included in the counterparty derivative marktomarket exposure at their net credit exposure value which is typically small or zero given the overcollateralized structure of these transactions 

    collateral taken in against secured financing transactions is generally high quality marketable securities consisting of government debt corporate debt or assetbacked securities 

  the table below sets forth the fair value of the securities collateral taken in by citi against secured financing transactions as of december 31 2011 

     secured financing transactions can be short term or can extend beyond one year in most cases citi has the right to call for additional margin daily and can terminate the transaction and liquidate the collateral if the counterparty fails to post the additional margin 

  the table below sets forth the remaining transaction tenor for these transactions as of december 31 2011

crossborder risk crossborder risk is the risk that actions taken by a nonus government may prevent the conversion of local currency into nonlocal currency andor the transfer of funds outside the country among other risks thereby impacting the ability of citigroup and its customers to transact business across borders examples of crossborder risk include actions taken by foreign governments such as exchange controls and restrictions on the remittance of funds these actions might restrict the transfer of funds or the ability of citigroup to obtain payment from customers on their contractual obligations management of crossborder risk at citi is performed through a formal review process that includes annual setting of crossborder limits and ongoing monitoring of crossborder exposures as well as monitoring of economic conditions globally through citi’s global country risk management see also “risk factors—market and economic risks” above   under federal financial institutions examination council ffiec regulatory guidelines total reported crossborder outstandings include crossborder claims on third parties as well as investments in and funding of local franchises crossborder claims on third parties trade and short medium and longterm claims include crossborder loans securities deposits with 

banks investments in affiliates and other monetary assets as well as net revaluation gains on foreign exchange and derivative products   ffiec crossborder risk measures exposure to the immediate obligors or counterparties domiciled in the given country or if applicable by the location of collateral or guarantors of the legally binding guarantees crossborder outstandings are reported based on the country of the obligor or guarantor outstandings backed by cash collateral are assigned to the country in which the collateral is held for securities received as collateral crossborder outstandings are reported in the domicile of the issuer of the securities crossborder resale agreements are presented based on the domicile of the counterparty   investments in and funding of local franchises represent the excess of local country assets over local country liabilities local country assets are claims on local residents recorded by branches and majorityowned subsidiaries of citigroup domiciled in the country adjusted for externally guaranteed claims and certain collateral local country liabilities are obligations of nonus branches and majorityowned subsidiaries of citigroup for which no crossborder guarantee has been issued by another citigroup office 

  the table below sets forth the countries where citigroup’s total crossborder outstandings as defined by ffiec guidelines exceeded 075 of total citigroup assets as of december 31 2011 and december 31 2010

differences between country and crossborder risk as described in more detail in the sections above there are significant differences between the reporting of country risk and crossborder risk a general summary of the more significant differences is as follows 

country risk is the risk that an event within a country will impair the value of citi’s franchise or adversely affect the ability of obligors within the country to honor their obligations to citi country risk reporting in citi’s internal risk management systems is based on the identification of the country where the client relationship taken as a whole is most directly exposed to the economic financial sociopolitical or legal risks generally country risk includes the benefit of margin received as well as offsetting exposures and hedge positions as such country risk which is reported based on citi’s internal risk management standards measures net exposure to a credit or market risk event crossborder risk as defined by the ffiec focuses on the potential exposure if foreign governments take actions such as enacting exchange controls that prevent the conversion of local currency to nonlocal currency or restrict the remittance of funds outside the country unlike country risk ffiec crossborder risk measures exposure to the immediate obligors or counterparties domiciled in the given country or if applicable by the location of collateral or guarantors of the legally binding guarantees generally without the benefit of margin received or hedge positions and recognizes offsetting exposures only for certain products 

  the differences between the presentation of country risk and crossborder risk can be substantial including the identification of the country of risk as described above in addition some of the more significant differences by product are described below 

for country risk net derivative receivables are generally reported based on fair value netting receivables and payables under the same legally binding netting agreement and recognizing the benefit of margin received and any hedge positions in place for crossborder risk these items are also reported based on fair value and allow for netting of receivables and payables if a legally binding netting agreement is in place but only with the same specific counterparty and do not recognize the benefit of margin received or hedges in place for country risk secured financing transactions such as repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements as well as securities loaned and borrowed are reported based on the net credit exposure arising from the transaction which is typically small or zero given the overcollateralized structure of these transactions for crossborder risk reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowed are reported based on notional amounts and do not include the value of any collateral received repurchase agreements and securities loaned are not included in crossborder risk reporting for country risk loans are reported net of hedges and collateral pledged under bankruptcyremote structures for crossborder risk loans are reported without taking hedges into account for country risk securities in afs and trading portfolios are reported on a net basis netting long positions against short positions for crossborder risk securities in afs and trading portfolios are not netted for country risk credit default swaps cdss are reported based on the net notional amount of cdss purchased and sold assuming zero recovery from the underlying entity and adjusted for any marktomarket receivable or payable position for crossborder risk cdss are included based on the gross notional amount sold and do not include any offsetting purchased cdss on the same underlying entity venezuelan operations in 2003 the venezuelan government enacted currency restrictions that have restricted citigroup’s ability to obtain us dollars in venezuela at the official foreign currency rate in may 2010 the government enacted new laws that have closed the parallel foreign exchange market and established a new foreign exchange market citigroup does not have access to us dollars in this new market citigroup uses the official rate to remeasure the foreign currency transactions in the financial statements of its venezuelan operations which have us dollar functional currencies into us dollars at december 31 2011 and 2010 citigroup had net monetary assets in its venezuelan operations denominated in bolivars of approximately 241 million and 200 million respectively 

fair value adjustments for derivatives and structured debt 

the following discussions relate to the derivative obligor information and the fair valuation for derivatives and structured debt see note 23 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on citi’s derivative activities 

fair valuation adjustments for derivatives the fair value adjustments applied by citigroup to its derivative carrying values consist of the following items 

liquidity adjustments are applied to items in level 2 or level 3 of the fairvalue hierarchy see note 25 to the consolidated financial statements for more details to ensure that the fair value reflects the price at which the entire position could be liquidated the liquidity reserve is based on the bidoffer spread for an instrument adjusted to take into account the size of the position credit valuation adjustments cva is applied to overthecounter derivative instruments in which the base valuation generally discounts expected cash flows using libor interest rate curves because not all counterparties have the same credit risk as that implied by the relevant libor curve a cva is necessary to incorporate the market view of both counterparty credit risk and citi’s own credit risk in the valuation   citigroup cva methodology comprises two steps first the exposure profile for each counterparty is determined using the terms of all individual derivative positions and a monte carlo simulation or other quantitative analysis to generate a series of expected cash flows at future points in time the calculation of this exposure profile considers the effect of credit risk mitigants including pledged cash or other collateral and any legal right of offset that exists with a counterparty through arrangements such as netting agreements individual derivative contracts that are subject to an enforceable master netting agreement with a counterparty are aggregated for this purpose since it is those aggregate net cash flows that are subject to nonperformance risk this process identifies specific pointintime future cash flows that are subject to nonperformance risk rather than using the current recognized net asset or liability as a basis to measure the cva   second marketbased views of default probabilities derived from observed credit spreads in the cds market are applied to the expected future cash flows determined in step one citi’s owncredit cva is determined using citispecific cds spreads for the relevant tenor generally counterparty cva is determined using cds spread indices for each credit rating and tenor for certain identified facilities where individual analysis is practicable for example exposures to monoline counterparties counterpartyspecific cds spreads are used   the cva adjustment is designed to incorporate a market view of the credit risk inherent in the derivative portfolio however most derivative instruments are negotiated bilateral contracts and are not commonly transferred to third parties derivative instruments are normally settled contractually or if terminated early are terminated at a value negotiated bilaterally between the counterparties therefore the cva both counterparty and owncredit may 

not be realized upon a settlement or termination in the normal course of business in addition all or a portion of the cva may be reversed or otherwise adjusted in future periods in the event of changes in the credit risk of citi or its counterparties or changes in the credit mitigants collateral and netting agreements associated with the derivative instruments   the table below summarizes the cva applied to the fair value of derivative instruments as of december 31 2011 and 2010 

  own dva for structured debt own debt valuation adjustments dva are recognized on citi’s debt liabilities for which the fair value option fvo has been elected using citi’s credit spreads observed in the bond market accordingly the fair value of debt liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected other than nonrecourse and similar liabilities is impacted by the narrowing or widening of citi’s credit spreads changes in fair value resulting from changes in citi’s instrumentspecific credit risk are estimated by incorporating citi’s current credit spreads observable in the bond market into the relevant valuation technique used to value each liability   the table below summarizes pretax gains losses related to changes in cva on derivative instruments net of hedges and dva on own fvo debt 

   the cva and dva amounts shown above do not include the effect of counterparty credit risk embedded in nonderivative instruments losses on nonderivative instruments such as bonds and loans related to counterparty credit risk are not included in the table above 

credit derivatives 

citigroup makes markets in and trades a range of credit derivatives both on behalf of clients as well as for its own account through these contracts citi either purchases or writes protection on either a singlename or portfolio basis citi primarily uses credit derivatives to help mitigate credit risk in its corporate loan portfolio and other cash positions and to facilitate client transactions   credit derivatives generally require that the seller of credit protection make payments to the buyer upon the occurrence of predefined events settlement triggers these settlement triggers which are defined by the form of the derivative and the referenced credit are generally limited to the market standard of failure to pay indebtedness and bankruptcy or comparable events of the reference credit and in a more limited range of transactions debt restructuring   credit derivative transactions referring to emerging market reference credits will also typically include additional settlement triggers to cover the acceleration of indebtedness and the risk of repudiation or a payment moratorium in certain transactions on a portfolio of referenced credits or assetbacked securities the seller of protection may not be required to make payment until a specified amount of losses has occurred with respect to the portfolio andor may only be required to pay for losses up to a specified amount   

the fair values shown below are prior to the application of any netting agreements cash collateral and market or credit valuation adjustments   citi actively participates in trading a variety of credit derivatives products as both an active twoway marketmaker for clients and to manage credit risk the majority of this activity was transacted with other financial intermediaries including both banks and brokerdealers citi generally has a mismatch between the total notional amounts of protection purchased and sold and it may hold the reference assets directly rather than entering into offsetting credit derivative contracts as and when desired the open risk exposures from credit derivative contracts are largely matched after certain cash positions in reference assets are considered and after notional amounts are adjusted either to a durationbased equivalent basis or to reflect the level of subordination in tranched structures   citi actively monitors its counterparty credit risk in credit derivative contracts approximately 96 and 89 of the gross receivables are from counterparties with which citi maintains collateral agreements as of december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 respectively a majority of citi’s top 15 counterparties by receivable balance owed to citi are banks financial institutions or other dealers contracts with these counterparties do not include ratingsbased termination events however counterparty ratings downgrades may have an incremental effect by lowering the threshold at which citi may call for additional collateral 

  the following tables summarize the key characteristics of citi’s credit derivatives portfolio by counterparty and derivative form as of december 31 2011 and december 31 2010

significant accounting policies and significant estimates 

note 1 to the consolidated financial statements contains a summary of citigroup’s significant accounting policies including a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements these policies as well as estimates made by management are integral to the presentation of citi’s results of operations and financial condition while all of these policies require a certain level of management judgment and estimates this section highlights and discusses the significant accounting policies that require management to make highly difficult complex or subjective judgments and estimates at times regarding matters that are inherently uncertain and susceptible to change management has discussed each of these significant accounting policies the related estimates and its judgments with the audit committee of the board of directors additional information about these policies can be found in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

valuations of financial instruments citigroup holds fixed income and equity securities derivatives retained interests in securitizations investments in private equity and other financial instruments in addition citi purchases securities under agreements to resell reverse repos and sells securities under agreements to repurchase repos citigroup holds its investments trading assets and liabilities and resale and repurchase agreements on the consolidated balance sheet to meet customer needs to manage liquidity needs and interest rate risks and for proprietary trading and private equity investing   substantially all of the assets and liabilities described in the preceding paragraph are reflected at fair value on citi’s consolidated balance sheet in addition certain loans shortterm borrowings longterm debt and deposits as well as certain securities borrowed and loaned positions that are collateralized with cash are carried at fair value approximately 388 and 373 of total assets and 157 and 166 of total liabilities were accounted for at fair value as of december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively   when available citi generally uses quoted market prices to determine fair value and classifies such items within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy established under asc 82010 fair value measurements and disclosures see note 25 to the consolidated financial statements if quoted market prices are not available fair value is based upon internally developed valuation models that use where possible current marketbased or independently sourced market parameters such as interest rates currency rates and option volatilities where a model is internally developed and used to price a significant product it is subject to validation and testing by independent personnel such models are often based on a discounted cash flow analysis in addition items valued using such internally generated valuation techniques are classified according to the lowest level input or value driver that is significant to the valuation thus an item may be classified in level 3 even though there may be some significant inputs that are readily observable 

  the credit crisis caused some markets to become illiquid thus reducing the availability of certain observable data used by citi’s valuation techniques this illiquidity in at least certain markets continued through 2011 when or if liquidity returns to these markets the valuations will revert to using the related observable inputs in verifying internally calculated values for additional information on citigroup’s fair value analysis see “managing global risk” 

recognition of changes in fair value changes in the valuation of the trading assets and liabilities as well as all other assets excluding availableforsale securities and derivatives in qualifying cash flow hedging relationships and liabilities carried at fair value are recorded in the consolidated statement of income changes in the valuation of availableforsale securities other than writeoffs and credit impairments and the effective portion of changes in the valuation of derivatives in qualifying cash flow hedging relationships generally are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss aoci which is a component of stockholders’ equity on the consolidated balance sheet a full description of citi’s policies and procedures relating to recognition of changes in fair value can be found in notes 1 25 26 and 27 to the consolidated financial statements 

evaluation of otherthantemporary impairment citi conducts and documents periodic reviews of all securities with unrealized losses to evaluate whether the impairment is otherthantemporary under the guidance for debt securities otherthantemporary impairment otti is recognized in earnings in the consolidated statement of income for debt securities that citi has an intent to sell or that citi believes it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell prior to recovery of the amortized cost basis for those securities that citi does not intend to sell or expect to be required to sell creditrelated impairment is recognized in earnings with the noncreditrelated impairment recorded in aoci   an unrealized loss exists when the current fair value of an individual security is less than its amortized cost basis unrealized losses that are determined to be temporary in nature are recorded net of tax in aoci for availableforsale securities while such losses related to heldtomaturity securities are not recorded as these investments are carried at their amortized cost less any otherthantemporary impairment for securities transferred to heldtomaturity from trading account assets  amortized cost is defined as the fair value amount of the securities at the date of transfer plus any accretion income and less any impairments recognized in earnings subsequent to transfer for securities transferred to heldtomaturity from availableforsale amortized cost is defined as the original purchase cost plus or minus any accretion or amortization of a purchase discount or premium less any impairment recognized in earnings 

regardless of the classification of the securities as availableforsale or heldtomaturity citi assesses each position with an unrealized loss for otti   management assesses equity method investments with fair value less than carrying value for otti as discussed in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for investments that management does not plan to sell prior to recovery of value or citi is not likely to be required to sell various factors are considered in assessing otti for investments that citi plans to sell prior to recovery of value or would likely be required to sell and there is no expectation that the fair value will recover prior to the expected sale date the full impairment would be recognized in the consolidated statement of income   at december 31 2011 citi had several equity method investments that had temporary impairment including its investments in akbank and the morgan stanley smith barney joint venture as of december 31 2011 management does not plan to sell those investments prior to recovery of value and it is not more likely than not that citi will be required to sell those investments for additional information on these equity method investments see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements evaluating investments for otherthantemporary impairments below 

cvadva methodology asc 82010 requires that citi’s own credit risk be considered in determining the market value of any citi liability carried at fair value these liabilities include derivative instruments as well as debt and other liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected the credit valuation adjustment cva is recognized on the balance sheet as a reduction or increase in the associated derivative asset or liability to arrive at the fair value carrying value of the derivative asset or liability the debt valuation adjustment dva is recognized on the balance sheet as a reduction or increase in the associated fair value option debt liability to arrive at the fair value of the liability for additional information see “fair value adjustments for derivatives and structured debt” above 

allowance for credit losses 

allowance for funded lending commitments management provides reserves for an estimate of probable losses inherent in the funded loan portfolio on the consolidated balance sheet in the form of an allowance for loan losses these reserves are established in accordance with citigroup’s credit reserve policies as approved by the audit committee of the board of directors citi’s chief risk officer and chief financial officer review the adequacy of the credit loss reserves each quarter with representatives from the risk management and finance staffs for each applicable business area applicable business areas include those having classifiably managed portfolios where internal creditrisk ratings are assigned primarily institutional clients group and global consumer banking  or modified consumer loans where concessions were granted due to the borrowers’ financial difficulties 

  the abovementioned representatives covering these respective business areas present recommended reserve balances for their funded and unfunded lending portfolios along with supporting quantitative and qualitative data the quantitative data include 

estimated probable losses for nonperforming nonhomogeneous exposures within a business line’s classifiably managed portfolio and impaired smallerbalance homogeneous loans whose terms have been modified due to the borrowers’ financial difficulties where it was determined that a concession was granted to the borrower consideration may be given to the following as appropriate when determining this estimate i the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s original effective rate ii the borrower’s overall financial condition resources and payment record and iii the prospects for support from financially responsible guarantors or the realizable value of any collateral when impairment is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows the entire change in present value is recorded in the provision for loan losses  statistically calculated losses inherent in the classifiably managed portfolio for performing and de minimis nonperforming exposures  the calculation is based upon i citigroup’s internal system of creditrisk ratings which are analogous to the risk ratings of the major credit rating agencies and ii historical default and loss data including rating agency information regarding default rates from 1983 to 2011 and internal data dating to the early 1970s on severity of losses in the event of default additional adjustments these include i statistically calculated estimates to cover the historical fluctuation of the default rates over the credit cycle the historical variability of loss severity among defaulted loans and the degree to which there are large obligor concentrations in the global portfolio and ii adjustments made for specifically known items such as current environmental factors and credit trends   in addition representatives from both the risk management and finance staffs that cover business areas with delinquencymanaged portfolios containing smaller homogeneous loans present their recommended reserve balances based upon leading credit indicators including loan delinquencies and changes in portfolio size as well as economic trends including housing prices unemployment and gdp this methodology is applied separately for each individual product within each different geographic region in which these portfolios exist 

  this evaluation process is subject to numerous estimates and judgments the frequency of default risk ratings loss recovery rates the size and diversity of individual large credits and the ability of borrowers with foreign currency obligations to obtain the foreign currency necessary for orderly debt servicing among other things are all taken into account during this review changes in these estimates could have a direct impact on citi’s credit costs in any quarter and could result in a change in the allowance changes to the allowance are recorded in the provision for loan losses 

allowance for unfunded lending commitments a similar approach to the allowance for loan losses is used for calculating a reserve for the expected losses related to unfunded loan commitments and standby letters of credit this reserve is classified on the consolidated balance sheet in other liabilities  changes to the allowance for unfunded lending commitments are recorded in the provision for unfunded lending commitments   for a further description of the loan loss reserve and related accounts see notes 1 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements 

securitizations citigroup securitizes a number of different asset classes as a means of strengthening its balance sheet and accessing competitive financing rates in the market under these securitization programs assets are transferred into a trust and used as collateral by the trust to obtain financing the cash flows from assets in the trust service the corresponding trust liabilities and equity interests if the structure of the trust meets certain accounting guidelines trust assets are treated as sold and are no longer reflected as assets of citi if these guidelines are not met the assets continue to be recorded as citi’s assets with the financing activity recorded as liabilities on citi’s consolidated balance sheet   citigroup also assists its clients in securitizing their financial assets and packages and securitizes financial assets purchased in the financial markets citi may also provide administrative asset management underwriting liquidity facilities andor other services to the resulting securitization entities and may continue to service some of these financial assets 

elimination of qualifying special purpose entities qspes and changes in the consolidation model for vies in june 2009 the fasb issued sfas no 166 accounting for transfers of financial assets an amendment of fasb statement no 140 sfas 166 now incorporated into asc topic 860 and sfas no 167 amendments to fasb interpretation no 46r sfas 167 now incorporated into asc topic 810 citigroup adopted both standards on january 1 2010 and elected to apply sfas 166 and sfas 167 prospectively accordingly prior periods have not been restated 

  sfas 166 eliminated the concept of qspes from us gaap and amends the guidance on accounting for transfers of financial assets sfas 167 details three key changes to the consolidation model first former qspes are now included in the scope of sfas 167 second the fasb has changed the method of analyzing which party to a variable interest entity vie should consolidate the vie known as the primary beneficiary to a qualitative determination of which party to the vie has “power” combined with potentially significant benefits or losses instead of the previous quantitative risks and rewards model the party that has “power” has the ability to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the vie’s economic performance third the new standard requires that the primary beneficiary analysis be reevaluated whenever circumstances change the previous rules required reconsideration of the primary beneficiary only when specified reconsideration events occurred   as a result of implementing these new accounting standards citigroup consolidated certain of the vies and former qspes with which it had involvement on january 1 2010 further certain asset transfers including transfers of portions of assets that would have been considered sales under sfas 140 are considered secured borrowings under the new standards citigroup consolidated all required vies and former qspes as of january 1 2010 at carrying values or unpaid principal amounts except for certain privatelabel residential mortgage and mutual fund deferred sales commissions vies for which the fair value option was elected   the incremental impact of these changes on gaap assets and resulting riskweighted assets for those vies and former qspes that were consolidated or deconsolidated for accounting purposes as of january 1 2010 was an increase in gaap assets of 1373 billion and 240 billion in riskweighted assets in addition the cumulative effect of adopting these new accounting standards as of january 1 2010 resulted in an aggregate aftertax charge to retained earnings of 84 billion reflecting the net effect of an overall pretax charge to retained earnings primarily relating to the establishment of loan loss reserves and the reversal of residual interests held of 134 billion and the recognition of related deferred tax assets amounting to 50 billion 

nonconsolidation of certain investment funds the fasb issued accounting standards update no 201010 consolidation topic 810 amendments for certain investment funds asu 201010 in the first quarter of 2010 asu 201010 provides a deferral of the requirements of sfas 167 for certain investment funds citigroup has determined that a majority of the investment vehicles managed by it are provided a deferral from the requirements of sfas 167 as they meet these criteria these vehicles continue to be evaluated under the requirements of fin 46r asc 81010 prior to the implementation of sfas 167 

  where citi has determined that certain investment vehicles are subject to the consolidation requirements of sfas 167 the consolidation conclusions reached upon initial application of sfas 167 are consistent with the consolidation conclusions reached under the requirements of asc 81010 prior to the implementation of sfas 167   for additional information see notes 1 and 22 to the consolidated financial statements 

goodwill citigroup has recorded goodwill of 254 billion 14 of assets and 262 billion 14 of assets on its consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 respectively no goodwill impairment was recorded during 2009 2010 and 2011   goodwill is allocated to citi’s reporting units at the date the goodwill is initially recorded once goodwill has been allocated to the reporting units it generally no longer retains its identification with a particular acquisition but instead becomes identified with the reporting unit as a whole as a result the full fair value of each reporting unit is available to support the value of goodwill allocated to the unit as of december 31 2011 citigroup operated in three core business segments as discussed above goodwill impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level one level below the business segment   the reporting unit structure in 2011 was consistent with the reporting units identified in the second quarter of 2009 as a result of the change in citi’s organizational structure during 2011 goodwill was allocated to disposals and tested for impairment under these reporting units the nine reporting units were north america regional consumer banking emea regional consumer banking asia regional consumer banking latin america regional consumer banking securities and banking transaction services brokerage and asset management local consumer lending—cards and local consumer lending—other   under asc 350 intangibles—goodwill and other the goodwill impairment analysis is done in two steps the first step requires a comparison of the fair value of the individual reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit is in excess of the carrying value the related goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no further analysis is necessary if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value there is an indication of potential impairment and a second step of testing is performed to measure the amount of impairment if any for that reporting unit   when required the second step of testing involves calculating the implied fair value of goodwill for each of the affected reporting units the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination which is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit determined in step one over the fair value of the net assets and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit were being acquired if the amount of the goodwill allocated to the reporting unit 

exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill in the pro forma purchase price allocation an impairment charge is recorded for the excess a recognized impairment charge cannot exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to a reporting unit and cannot subsequently be reversed even if the fair value of the reporting unit recovers   goodwill impairment testing involves management judgment requiring an assessment of whether the carrying value of the reporting unit can be supported by the fair value of the individual reporting unit using widely accepted valuation techniques such as the market approach earnings multiples andor transaction multiples andor the income approach discounted cash flow dcf method in applying these methodologies citi utilizes a number of factors including actual operating results future business plans economic projections and market data management may engage an independent valuation specialist to assist in citi’s valuation process   citigroup engaged the services of an independent valuation specialist in 2010 and 2011 to assist in citi’s valuation for most of the reporting units employing both the market approach and dcf method citi believes that the dcf method using management projections for the selected reporting units and an appropriate riskadjusted discount rate is most reflective of a market participant’s view of fair values given current market conditions for the reporting units where both methods were utilized in 2010 and 2011 the resulting fair values were relatively consistent and appropriate weighting was given to outputs from both methods   the dcf method used at the time of each impairment test used discount rates that citi believes adequately reflected the risk and uncertainty in the financial markets generally and specifically in the internally generated cash flow projections the dcf method employs a capital asset pricing model in estimating the discount rate citi continues to value the remaining reporting units where it believes the risk of impairment to be low using primarily the market approach   citi prepares a formal threeyear strategic plan for its businesses on an annual basis these projections incorporate certain external economic projections developed at the point in time the strategic plan is developed for the purpose of performing any impairment test the threeyear forecast is updated by citi to reflect current economic conditions as of the testing date citi used updated longrange financial forecasts as a basis for its annual goodwill impairment test performed as of july 1 2011   the results of the july 1 2011 test validated that the fair values exceeded the carrying values for the reporting units that had goodwill at the testing date citi is also required to test goodwill for impairment whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that impairment may have occurred such as a significant adverse change in the business climate a decision to sell or dispose of all or a significant portion of a reporting unit or a significant decline in citi’s stock price no interim goodwill impairment tests were performed during 2011 

  since none of the company’s reporting units are publicly traded individual reporting unit fair value determinations cannot be directly correlated to citigroup’s stock price the sum of the fair values of the reporting units at july 1 2011 exceeded the overall market capitalization of citi as of july 1 2011 however citi believes that it was not meaningful to reconcile the sum of the fair values of its reporting units to its market capitalization during the 2011 annual impairment test due to the fact that citi’s market capitalization reflects the execution risk in a transaction involving citigroup due to its size the individual reporting units’ fair values are not subject to the same level of execution risk or a business model that is perceived to be complex   see also note 18 to the consolidated financial statements 

income taxes citi is subject to the income tax laws of the us its states and local municipalities and the foreign jurisdictions in which citi operates these tax laws are complex and are subject to differing interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be subject to review and adjudication by the court systems of the various tax jurisdictions or may be settled with the taxing authority upon audit   in establishing a provision for income tax expense citi must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws citi must also make estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions both domestic and foreign deferred taxes are recorded for the future consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns based upon enacted tax laws and rates deferred tax assets dtas are recognized subject to management’s judgment that realization is more likely than not   at december 31 2011 citi had recorded net dtas of approximately 515 billion a decrease of 06 billion from 521 billion at december 31 2010   although realization is not assured citi believes that the realization of the recognized net dta of 515 billion at december 31 2011 is more likely than not based upon expectations as to future taxable income in the jurisdictions in which the dtas arise and based on available tax planning strategies as defined in asc 740 income taxes that would be implemented if necessary to prevent a carryforward from expiring   in general citi would need to generate approximately 111 billion of taxable income during the respective carryforward periods discussed below to fully realize its us federal state and local dtas citi’s net dtas will decline primarily as additional domestic gaap taxable income is generated 

  as of december 31 2011 citi was no longer in a threeyear cumulative loss position for purposes of evaluating its dtas while this removes a significant piece of negative evidence in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance citi will continue to weigh the evidence supporting its dtas citi has concluded that there are two pieces of positive evidence that support the full realizability of its dtas first citi forecasts sufficient taxable income in the carryforward period exclusive of tax planning strategies second citi has sufficient tax planning strategies including potential sales of assets in which it could realize the excess of appreciated value over the tax basis of its assets the amount of the dtas considered realizable however is necessarily subject to citi’s estimates of future taxable income in the jurisdictions in which it operates during the respective carryforward periods which is in turn subject to overall market and global economic conditions   the following table summarizes citi’s net dtas balance at december 31 2011 and 2010

  the us federal consolidated tax return nol carryforward component of the dtas of 38 billion at december 31 2010 was utilized in 2011 for the reasons discussed herein citi believes the us federal and new york state and city nol carryforward period of 20 years provides enough time to fully utilize the dtas pertaining to the existing nol carryforwards and any nol that would be created by the reversal of the future net deductions that have not yet been taken on a tax return   because the us federal consolidated tax return nol carryforward has been utilized citi can begin to utilize its foreign tax credit ftc and general business credit gbc carryforwards the us ftc carryforward period is 10 years utilization of foreign tax credits in any year is restricted to 35 of foreign source taxable income in that year however overall domestic losses that citi has incurred of approximately 56 billion as of december 31 2011 are allowed to be reclassified as foreign source income to the extent of 50 of domestic source income produced in subsequent years and such resulting foreign source income would in fact be sufficient to cover the foreign tax credits being carried forward as such citi believes the foreign source taxable income limitation will not be an impediment to the foreign tax credit carryforward usage as long as citi can generate sufficient domestic taxable income within the 10year carryforward period   regarding the estimate of future taxable income citi has projected its pretax earnings predominantly based upon the “core” businesses that citi intends to conduct going forward these “core” businesses have produced steady and strong earnings in the past citi believes that it will generate sufficient pretax earnings within the 10year carryforward period referenced above to be able to fully utilize the foreign tax credit carryforward in addition to any foreign tax credits produced in such period   as mentioned above citi has examined tax planning strategies available to it in accordance with asc 740 that would be employed if necessary to prevent a carryforward from expiring and to accelerate the usage of its carryforwards these strategies include repatriating lowtaxed foreign source earnings for which an assertion that the earnings have been indefinitely reinvested has not been made accelerating us taxable income into or deferring us tax deductions out of the latter years of the carryforward period eg selling appreciated intangible assets and electing straightline depreciation accelerating deductible temporary differences outside the us holding onto availableforsale debt securities with losses until they mature and selling certain assets that produce taxexempt income while purchasing assets that produce fully taxable income in addition the sale or restructuring of certain businesses can produce significant us taxable income within the relevant carryforward periods 

  as previously disclosed citi’s ability to utilize its dtas to offset future taxable income may be significantly limited if citi experiences an “ownership change” as defined in section 382 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended code generally an ownership change will occur if there is a cumulative change in citi’s ownership by “5percent shareholders” as defined in the code that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling threeyear period any limitation on citi’s ability to utilize its dtas arising from an ownership change under section 382 will depend on the value of citi’s stock at the time of the ownership change   see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for a further description of citi’s tax provision and related income tax assets and liabilities   approximately 11 billion of the net dtas was included in tier 1 common and tier 1 capital as of december 31 2011

accounting changes and future application of accounting standards see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of “accounting changes” and the “future application of accounting standards” 

disclosure controls and procedures

1 summary of significant accounting policies 

principles of consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of citigroup and its subsidiaries the company consolidates subsidiaries in which it holds directly or indirectly more than 50 of the voting rights or where it exercises control entities where the company holds 20 to 50 of the voting rights andor has the ability to exercise significant influence other than investments of designated venture capital subsidiaries or investments accounted for at fair value under the fair value option are accounted for under the equity method and the pro rata share of their income loss is included in other revenue  income from investments in less than 20owned companies is recognized when dividends are received as discussed below citigroup consolidates entities deemed to be variable interest entities when citigroup is determined to be the primary beneficiary gains and losses on the disposition of branches subsidiaries affiliates buildings and other investments are included in other revenue   throughout these notes “citigroup” “citi” and “the company” refer to citigroup inc and its consolidated subsidiaries   certain reclassifications have been made to the priorperiods’ financial statements and notes to conform to the current period’s presentation 

citibank na citibank na is a commercial bank and wholly owned subsidiary of citigroup inc citibank’s principal offerings include consumer finance mortgage lending and retail banking products and services investment banking commercial banking cash management trade finance and ecommerce products and services and private banking products and services 

variable interest entities an entity is referred to as a variable interest entity vie if it meets the criteria outlined in asc 810 consolidation formerly sfas no 167 amendments to fasb interpretation no 46r  sfas 167 which are 1 the entity has equity that is insufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties or 2 the entity has equity investors that cannot make significant decisions about the entity’s operations or that do not absorb their proportionate share of the entity’s expected losses or expected returns   prior to january 1 2010 the company consolidated a vie if it had a majority of the expected losses or a majority of the expected residual returns or both as of january 1 2010 when the company adopted sfas 167’s amendments to the vie consolidation guidance the company consolidates a vie when it has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the vie’s economic success and a right to receive benefits or absorb losses of the entity that could be potentially significant to the vie that is it is the primary beneficiary 

  along with the vies that are consolidated in accordance with these guidelines the company has variable interests in other vies that are not consolidated because the company is not the primary beneficiary these include multiseller finance companies certain collateralized debt obligations cdos many structured finance transactions and various investment funds   however these vies as well as all other unconsolidated vies are continually monitored by the company to determine if any events have occurred that could cause its primary beneficiary status to change these events include 

additional purchases or sales of variable interests by citigroup or an unrelated third party which cause citigroup’s overall variable interest ownership to change changes in contractual arrangements in a manner that reallocates expected losses and residual returns among the variable interest holders changes in the party that has power to direct activities of a vie that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and providing support to an entity that results in an implicit variable interest   all other entities not deemed to be vies with which the company has involvement are evaluated for consolidation under other subtopics of asc 810 formerly accounting research bulletin arb no 51 consolidated financial statements  sfas no 94 consolidation of all majorityowned subsidiaries  and eitf issue no 045 “determining whether a general partner or the general partners as a group controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights” 

foreign currency translation assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated from their respective functional currencies into us dollars using periodend spot foreignexchange rates the effects of those translation adjustments are reported in a separate component of stockholders’ equity along with related hedge and tax effects until realized upon sale or liquidation of the foreign operation revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated monthly from their respective functional currencies into us dollars at amounts that approximate weighted average exchange rates   for transactions whose terms are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency including transactions denominated in the local currencies of foreign operations with the us dollar as their functional currency the effects of changes in exchange rates are primarily included in principal transactions  along with the related hedge effects instruments used to hedge foreign currency exposures include foreign currency forward option and swap contracts and designated issues of nonus dollar debt foreign operations in countries with highly inflationary economies designate the us dollar as their functional currency with the effects of changes in exchange rates primarily included in other revenue  

investment securities investments include fixed income and equity securities fixed income instruments include bonds notes and redeemable preferred stocks as well as certain loanbacked and structured securities that are subject to prepayment risk equity securities include common and nonredeemable preferred stock   investment securities are classified and accounted for as follows 

fixed income securities classified as “heldtomaturity” represent securities that the company has both the ability and the intent to hold until maturity and are carried at amortized cost interest income on such securities is included in interest revenue  fixed income securities and marketable equity securities classified as “availableforsale” are carried at fair value with changes in fair value reported in a separate component of stockholders’ equity  net of applicable income taxes as described in more detail in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements creditrelated declines in fair value that are determined to be other–thantemporary are recorded in earnings immediately realized gains and losses on sales are included in income primarily on a specific identification cost basis interest and dividend income on such securities is included in interest revenue  venture capital investments held by citigroup’s private equity subsidiaries that are considered investment companies are carried at fair value with changes in fair value reported in other revenue  these subsidiaries include entities registered as small business investment companies and engage exclusively in venture capital activities certain investments in nonmarketable equity securities and certain investments that would otherwise have been accounted for using the equity method are carried at fair value since the company has elected to apply fair value accounting changes in fair value of such investments are recorded in earnings certain nonmarketable equity securities are carried at cost and periodically assessed for otherthantemporary impairment as set out in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements   for investments in fixed income securities classified as heldtomaturity or availableforsale accrual of interest income is suspended for investments that are in default or on which it is likely that future interest payments will not be made as scheduled   the company uses a number of valuation techniques for investments carried at fair value which are described in note 25 to the consolidated financial statements realized gains and losses on sales of investments are included in income 

trading account assets and liabilities trading account assets include debt and marketable equity securities derivatives in a receivable position residual interests in securitizations and physical commodities inventory in addition as described in note 26 to the consolidated financial statements certain assets that citigroup has elected to carry at fair value under the fair value option such as loans and purchased guarantees are also included in trading account assets  

  trading account liabilities include securities sold not yet purchased short positions and derivatives in a net payable position as well as certain liabilities that citigroup has elected to carry at fair value as described in note 26 to the consolidated financial statements   other than physical commodities inventory all trading account assets and liabilities are carried at fair value revenues generated from trading assets and trading liabilities are generally reported in principal transactions and include realized gains and losses as well as unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value of such instruments interest income on trading assets is recorded in interest revenue reduced by interest expense on trading liabilities   physical commodities inventory is carried at the lower of cost or market with related losses reported in principal transactions  realized gains and losses on sales of commodities inventory are included in principal transactions    derivatives used for trading purposes include interest rate currency equity credit and commodity swap agreements options caps and floors warrants and financial and commodity futures and forward contracts derivative asset and liability positions are presented net by counterparty on the consolidated balance sheet when a valid master netting agreement exists and the other conditions set out in asc 21020 balance sheet—offsetting are met   the company uses a number of techniques to determine the fair value of trading assets and liabilities which are described in note 25 to the consolidated financial statements 

securities borrowed and securities loaned securities borrowing and lending transactions generally do not constitute a sale of the underlying securities for accounting purposes and so are treated as collateralized financing transactions when the transaction involves the exchange of cash such transactions are recorded at the amount of cash advanced or received plus accrued interest as described in note 26 to the consolidated financial statements the company has elected to apply fair value accounting to a number of securities borrowing and lending transactions irrespective of whether the company has elected fair value accounting fees paid or received for all securities lending and borrowing transactions are recorded in interest expense or interest revenue at the contractually specified rate   with respect to securities borrowed or loaned the company monitors the market value of securities borrowed or loaned on a daily basis and obtains or posts additional collateral in order to maintain contractual margin protection   as described in note 25 to the consolidated financial statements the company uses a discounted cash flow technique to determine the fair value of securities lending and borrowing transactions 

repurchase and resale agreements securities sold under agreements to repurchase repos and securities purchased under agreements to resell reverse repos generally do not constitute a sale for accounting purposes of the underlying securities and so 

are treated as collateralized financing transactions as set out in note 26 to the consolidated financial statements the company has elected to apply fair value accounting to a majority of such transactions with changes in fair value reported in earnings any transactions for which fair value accounting has not been elected are recorded at the amount of cash advanced or received plus accrued interest irrespective of whether the company has elected fair value accounting interest paid or received on all repo and reverse repo transactions is recorded in interest expense or interest revenue at the contractually specified rate   where the conditions of asc 210204511 balance sheet—offsetting repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements  are met repos and reverse repos are presented net on the consolidated balance sheet   the company’s policy is to take possession of securities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements the company monitors the market value of securities subject to repurchase or resale on a daily basis and obtains or posts additional collateral in order to maintain contractual margin protection   as described in note 25 to the consolidated financial statements the company uses a discounted cash flow technique to determine the fair value of repo and reverse repo transactions see related discussion of the assessment of the effective control for repurchase agreements in “future application of accounting standards” below 

repurchase and resale agreements and securities lending and borrowing agreements accounted for as sales where certain conditions are met under asc 86010 transfers and servicing formerly fasb statement no 166 accounting for transfers of financial assets  the company accounts for certain repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements as sales the key distinction resulting in these agreements being accounted for as sales is a reduction in initial margin or restriction in daily maintenance margin at december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 a nominal amount of these transactions were accounted for as sales that reduced trading account assets  

loans loans are reported at their outstanding principal balances net of any unearned income and unamortized deferred fees and costs except that credit card receivable balances also include accrued interest and fees loan origination fees and certain direct origination costs are generally deferred and recognized as adjustments to income over the lives of the related loans   as described in note 26 to the consolidated financial statements citi has elected fair value accounting for certain loans such loans are carried at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings interest income on such loans is recorded in interest revenue at the contractually specified rate   loans for which the fair value option has not been elected are classified upon origination or acquisition as either heldforinvestment or heldforsale this classification is based on management’s initial intent and ability with regard to those loans 

  loans that are heldforinvestment are classified as loans net of unearned income on the consolidated balance sheet and the related cash flows are included within the cash flows from investing activities category in the consolidated statement of cash flows on the line change in loans  however when the initial intent for holding a loan has changed from heldforinvestment to heldforsale the loan is reclassified to heldforsale but the related cash flows continue to be reported in cash flows from investing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows on the line proceeds from sales and securitizations of loans  

consumer loans consumer loans represent loans and leases managed primarily by the global consumer banking and local consumer lending businesses 

nonaccrual and reaging policies as a general rule interest accrual ceases for installment and real estate both open and closedend loans when payments are 90 days contractually past due for credit cards and unsecured revolving loans however citi generally accrues interest until payments are 180 days past due loans that have been modified to grant a shortterm or longterm concession to a borrower who is in financial difficulty may not be accruing interest at the time of the modification the policy for returning such modified loans to accrual status varies by product andor region in most cases a minimum number of payments ranging from one to six are required while in other cases the loan is never returned to accrual status   for us consumer loans one of the conditions to qualify for modification is that a minimum number of payments typically ranging from one to three must be made upon modification the loan is reaged to current status however reaging practices for certain openended consumer loans such as credit cards are governed by federal financial institutions examination council ffiec guidelines for openended consumer loans subject to ffiec guidelines one of the conditions for the loan to be reaged to current status is that at least three consecutive minimum monthly payments or the equivalent amount must be received in addition under ffiec guidelines the number of times that such a loan can be reaged is subject to limitations generally once in twelve months and twice in five years furthermore federal housing administration fha and department of veterans affairs va loans are modified under those respective agencies’ guidelines and payments are not always required in order to reage a modified loan to current 

chargeoff policies citi’s chargeoff policies follow the general guidelines below

allowance for loan losses allowance for loan losses represents management’s best estimate of probable losses inherent in the portfolio as well as probable losses related to large individually evaluated impaired loans and troubled debt restructurings attribution of the allowance is made for analytical purposes only and the entire allowance is available to absorb probable loan losses inherent in the overall portfolio additions to the allowance are made through the provision for loan losses  loan losses are deducted from the allowance and subsequent recoveries are added assets received in exchange for loan claims in a restructuring are initially recorded at fair value with any gain or loss reflected as a recovery or chargeoff to the allowance 

corporate loans in the corporate portfolios the allowance for loan losses includes an assetspecific component and a statistically based component the assetspecific component is calculated under asc 3101035 receivables—subsequent measurement formerly sfas 114 on an individual basis for largerbalance nonhomogeneous loans which are considered impaired an assetspecific allowance is established when the discounted cash flows collateral value less disposal costs or observable market price of the impaired loan is lower than its carrying value this allowance considers the borrower’s overall financial condition resources and payment record the prospects for support from any financially responsible guarantors discussed further below and if appropriate the realizable value of any collateral the assetspecific component of the allowance for smaller balance impaired loans is calculated on a pool basis considering historical loss experience   the allowance for the remainder of the loan portfolio is calculated under asc 450 contingencies formerly sfas 5 using a statistical methodology supplemented by management judgment the statistical analysis considers the portfolio’s size remaining tenor and credit quality as measured by internal risk ratings assigned to individual credit facilities which reflect probability of default and loss given default the statistical analysis considers historical default rates and historical loss severity in the event of default including historical average levels and historical variability the result is an estimated range for inherent losses the best estimate within the range is then determined by management’s quantitative and qualitative assessment 

of current conditions including general economic conditions specific industry and geographic trends and internal factors including portfolio concentrations trends in internal credit quality indicators and current and past underwriting standards   for both the assetspecific and the statistically based components of the allowance for loan losses  management may incorporate guarantor support the financial wherewithal of the guarantor is evaluated as applicable based on net worth cash flow statements and personal or company financial statements which are updated and reviewed at least annually citi seeks performance on guarantee arrangements in the normal course of business seeking performance entails obtaining satisfactory cooperation from the guarantor or borrower to achieve citi’s strategy in the specific situation this regular cooperation is indicative of pursuit and successful enforcement of the guarantee the exposure is reduced without the expense and burden of pursuing a legal remedy enforcing a guarantee via legal action against the guarantor is not the primary means of resolving a troubled loan situation and rarely occurs a guarantor’s reputation and willingness to work with citigroup is evaluated based on the historical experience with the guarantor and the knowledge of the marketplace in the rare event that the guarantor is unwilling or unable to perform or facilitate borrower cooperation citi pursues a legal remedy if citi does not pursue a legal remedy it is because citi does not believe that the guarantor has the financial wherewithal to perform regardless of legal action or because there are legal limitations on simultaneously pursuing guarantors and foreclosure a guarantor’s reputation does not impact our decision or ability to seek performance under the guarantee   in cases where a guarantee is a factor in the assessment of loan losses it is included via adjustment to the loan’s internal risk rating which in turn is the basis for the adjustment to the statistically based component of the allowance for loan losses  to date it is only in rare circumstances that an impaired commercial or commercial real estate cre loan is carried at a value in excess of the appraised value due to a guarantee   when citi’s monitoring of the loan indicates that the guarantor’s wherewithal to pay is uncertain or has deteriorated there is either no change in the risk rating because the guarantor’s credit support was never initially factored in or the risk rating is adjusted to reflect that uncertainty or deterioration accordingly a guarantor’s ultimate failure to perform or a lack of legal enforcement of the guarantee does not materially impact the allowance for loan losses as there is typically no further significant adjustment of the loan’s risk rating at that time where citi is not seeking performance under the guarantee contract it provides for loans losses as if the loans were nonperforming and not guaranteed 

consumer loans for consumer loans each portfolio of nonmodified smallerbalance homogeneous loans is independently evaluated by product type eg residential mortgage credit card etc for impairment in accordance with asc 45020 the allowance for loan losses attributed to these loans is established via a process that estimates the probable losses inherent in the specific portfolio this process includes migration analysis in which 

historical delinquency and credit loss experience is applied to the current aging of the portfolio together with analyses that reflect current and anticipated economic conditions including changes in housing prices and unemployment trends citi’s allowance for loan losses under asc 45020 only considers contractual principal amounts due except for credit card loans where estimated loss amounts related to accrued interest receivable are also included   management also considers overall portfolio indicators including historical credit losses delinquent nonperforming and classified loans trends in volumes and terms of loans an evaluation of overall credit quality the credit process including lending policies and procedures and economic geographical product and other environmental factors   separate valuation allowances are determined for impaired smallerbalance homogeneous loans whose terms have been modified in a troubled debt restructuring tdr longterm modification programs as well as shortterm less than 12 months modifications originated from january 1 2011 that provide concessions such as interest rate reductions to borrowers in financial difficulty are reported as tdrs in addition loans included in the us treasury’s home affordable modification program hamp trial period at december 31 2011 are reported as tdrs the allowance for loan losses for tdrs is determined in accordance with asc 3101035 considering all available evidence including as appropriate the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s original contractual effective rate the secondary market value of the loan and the fair value of collateral less disposal costs these expected cash flows incorporate modification program default rate assumptions the original contractual effective rate for credit card loans is the premodification rate which may include interest rate increases under the original contractual agreement with the borrower   where shortterm concessions have been granted prior to january 1 2011 the allowance for loan losses is materially consistent with the requirements of asc 3101035   valuation allowances for commercial market loans which are classifiably managed consumer loans are determined in the same manner as for corporate loans and are described in more detail in the following section generally an assetspecific component is calculated under asc 3101035 on an individual basis for largerbalance nonhomogeneous loans that are considered impaired and the allowance for the remainder of the classifiably managed consumer loan portfolio is calculated under asc 450 using a statistical methodology supplemented by management adjustment 

reserve estimates and policies management provides reserves for an estimate of probable losses inherent in the funded loan portfolio on the balance sheet in the form of an allowance for loan losses these reserves are established in accordance with citigroup’s credit reserve policies as approved by the audit committee of the board of directors citi’s chief risk officer and chief financial officer review the adequacy of the credit loss reserves each quarter with representatives from the risk management and finance staffs for each applicable business area applicable business areas include those having classifiably managed 

portfolios where internal creditrisk ratings are assigned primarily institutional clients group and global consumer banking  or modified consumer loans where concessions were granted due to the borrowers’ financial difficulties   the abovementioned representatives covering these respective business areas present recommended reserve balances for their funded and unfunded lending portfolios along with supporting quantitative and qualitative data the quantitative data include 

estimated probable losses for nonperforming nonhomogeneous exposures within a business line’s classifiably managed portfolio and impaired smallerbalance homogeneous loans whose terms have been modified due to the borrowers’ financial difficulties and it was determined that a concession was granted to the borrower  consideration may be given to the following as appropriate when determining this estimate i the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s original effective rate ii the borrower’s overall financial condition resources and payment record and iii the prospects for support from financially responsible guarantors or the realizable value of any collateral in the determination of the allowance for loan losses for tdrs management considers a combination of historical redefault rates the current economic environment and the nature of the modification program when forecasting expected cash flows when impairment is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows the entire change in present value is recorded in the provision for loan losses  statistically calculated losses inherent in the classifiably managed portfolio for performing and de minimis nonperforming exposures  the calculation is based upon i citigroup’s internal system of creditrisk ratings which are analogous to the risk ratings of the major rating agencies and ii historical default and loss data including rating agency information regarding default rates from 1983 to 2010 and internal data dating to the early 1970s on severity of losses in the event of default additional adjustments include  i statistically calculated estimates to cover the historical fluctuation of the default rates over the credit cycle the historical variability of loss severity among defaulted loans and the degree to which there are large obligor concentrations in the global portfolio and ii adjustments made for specific known items such as current environmental factors and credit trends   in addition representatives from each of the risk management and finance staffs that cover business areas with delinquencymanaged portfolios containing smallerbalance homogeneous loans present their recommended reserve balances based upon leading credit indicators including loan delinquencies and changes in portfolio size as well as economic trends including housing prices unemployment and gdp this methodology is applied separately for each individual product within each geographic region in which these portfolios exist 

  this evaluation process is subject to numerous estimates and judgments the frequency of default risk ratings loss recovery rates the size and diversity of individual large credits and the ability of borrowers with foreign currency obligations to obtain the foreign currency necessary for orderly debt servicing among other things are all taken into account during this review changes in these estimates could have a direct impact on the credit costs in any period and could result in a change in the allowance changes to the allowance for loan losses are recorded in the provision for loan losses 

allowance for unfunded lending commitments a similar approach to the allowance for loan losses is used for calculating a reserve for the expected losses related to unfunded loan commitments and standby letters of credit this reserve is classified on the balance sheet in other liabilities  changes to the allowance for unfunded lending commitments are recorded in the provision for unfunded lending commitments  

mortgage servicing rights mortgage servicing rights msrs are recognized as intangible assets when purchased or when the company sells or securitizes loans acquired through purchase or origination and retains the right to service the loans mortgage servicing rights are accounted for at fair value with changes in value recorded in other revenue in the company’s consolidated statement of income   additional information on the company’s msrs can be found in note 22 to the consolidated financial statements 

consumer mortgage—representations and warranties the majority of citi’s exposure to representation and warranty claims relates to its us consumer mortgage business within citimortgage   when selling a loan citi makes various representations and warranties relating to among other things the following 

citi’s ownership of the loan the validity of the lien securing the loan the absence of delinquent taxes or liens against the property securing the loan the effectiveness of title insurance on the property securing the loan the process used in selecting the loans for inclusion in a transaction the loan’s compliance with any applicable loan criteria established by the buyer and the loan’s compliance with applicable local state and federal laws the specific representations and warranties made by citi depend on the nature of the transaction and the requirements of the buyer market conditions and credit rating agency requirements may also affect representations and warranties and the other provisions to which citi may agree in loan sales 

  in the event of a breach of these representations and warranties citi may be required to either repurchase the mortgage loans with the identified defects generally at unpaid principal balance plus accrued interest or indemnify “makewhole” the investors for their losses citi’s representations and warranties are generally not subject to stated limits in amount or time of coverage   in the case of a repurchase citi will bear any subsequent credit loss on the mortgage loan and the loan is typically considered a creditimpaired loan and accounted for under sop 033 “accounting for certain loans and debt securities acquired in a transfer” now incorporated into asc 31030 receivables—loans and debt securities acquired with deteriorated credit quality  sop 033 these repurchases have not had a material impact on citi’s nonperforming loan statistics because creditimpaired purchased sop 033 loans are not included in nonaccrual loans since they generally continue to accrue interest until writeoff citi’s repurchases have primarily been from the us government sponsored entities gses   citi has recorded a reserve for its exposure to losses from the obligation to repurchase previously sold loans referred to as the repurchase reserve that is included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet in estimating the repurchase reserve citi considers reimbursements estimated to be received from thirdparty correspondent lenders and indemnification agreements relating to previous acquisitions of mortgage servicing rights the estimated reimbursements are based on citi’s analysis of its most recent collection trends and the financial solvency of the correspondents   in the case of a repurchase of a creditimpaired sop 033 loan the difference between the loan’s fair value and unpaid principal balance at the time of the repurchase is recorded as a utilization of the repurchase reserve makewhole payments to the investor are also treated as utilizations and charged directly against the reserve the repurchase reserve is estimated when citi sells loans recorded as an adjustment to the gain on sale which is included in other revenue in the consolidated statement of income and is updated quarterly any change in estimate is recorded in other revenue    the repurchase reserve is calculated by individual sales vintage ie the year the loans were sold and is based on various assumptions these assumptions contain a level of uncertainty and risk that if different from actual results could have a material impact on the reserve amount the most significant assumptions used to calculate the reserve levels are as follows 

loan documentation requests repurchase claims as a percentage of loan documentation requests claims appeal success rate and estimated loss per repurchase or makewhole 

securities and banking sponsored legacy private label residential mortgage securitizations—representations and warranties legacy mortgage securitizations sponsored by citi’s sb business have represented a much smaller portion of citi’s mortgage business   the mortgages included in sb sponsored legacy securitizations were purchased from parties outside of sb  representations and warranties relating to the mortgage loans included in each trust issuing the securities were made either by citi by thirdparty sellers which were also often the originators of the loans or both these representations and warranties were generally made or assigned to the issuing trust and related to among other things the following 

the absence of fraud on the part of the borrower the seller or any appraiser broker or other party involved in the origination of the mortgage which was sometimes wholly or partially limited to the knowledge of the representation and warranty provider whether the mortgage property was occupied by the borrower as his or her principal residence the mortgage’s compliance with applicable federal state and local laws whether the mortgage was originated in conformity with the originator’s underwriting guidelines and detailed data concerning the mortgages that were included on the mortgage loan schedule   in the event of a breach of its representations and warranties citi may be required either to repurchase the mortgage with the identified defects generally at unpaid principal balance plus accrued interest or indemnify the investors for their losses through makewhole payments   to date citi has received actual claims for breaches of representations and warranties relating to only a small percentage of the mortgages included in these securitization transactions although the pace of claims remains volatile and has recently increased 

goodwill goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests whereby goodwill is allocated to the company’s reporting units and an impairment is deemed to exist if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value furthermore on any business dispositions goodwill is allocated to the business disposed of based on the ratio of the fair value of the business disposed of to the fair value of the reporting unit 

intangible assets intangible assets —including core deposit intangibles present value of future profits purchased credit card relationships other customer relationships and other intangible assets but excluding msrs—are amortized over their estimated useful lives intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives primarily certain asset management contracts 

  143 

and trade names are not amortized and are subject to annual impairment tests an impairment exists if the carrying value of the indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds its fair value for other intangible assets subject to amortization an impairment is recognized if the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds the fair value of the intangible asset 

other assets and other liabilities other assets include among other items loans heldforsale deferred tax assets equitymethod investments interest and fees receivable premises and equipment repossessed assets and other receivables other liabilities include among other items accrued expenses and other payables deferred tax liabilities and reserves for legal claims taxes unfunded lending commitments repositioning reserves and other matters 

other real estate owned and repossessed assets real estate or other assets received through foreclosure or repossession are generally reported in other assets  net of a valuation allowance for selling costs and net of subsequent declines in fair value 

securitizations the company primarily securitizes credit card receivables and mortgages other types of securitized assets include corporate debt instruments in cash and synthetic form and student loans   there are two key accounting determinations that must be made relating to securitizations citi first makes a determination as to whether the securitization entity would be consolidated second it determines whether the transfer of financial assets to the entity is considered a sale under gaap if the securitization entity is a vie the company consolidates the vie if it is the primary beneficiary   the company consolidates vies when it has both 1 power to direct activities of the vie that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and 2 an obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie   for all other securitization entities determined not to be vies in which citigroup participates a consolidation decision is based on who has voting control of the entity giving consideration to removal and liquidation rights in certain partnership structures only securitization entities controlled by citigroup are consolidated   interests in the securitized and sold assets may be retained in the form of subordinated or senior interestonly strips subordinated tranches spread accounts and servicing rights in credit card securitizations the company retains a seller’s interest in the credit card receivables transferred to the trusts which is not in securitized form in the case of consolidated securitization entities including the credit card trusts these retained interests are not reported on citi’s consolidated balance sheet rather the securitized loans remain on the balance sheet substantially all of the consumer loans sold or securitized through nonconsolidated trusts by citigroup are us prime residential mortgage loans retained interests in nonconsolidated mortgage securitization trusts are classified as trading account assets  except for msrs which are included in mortgage servicing rights on citigroup’s consolidated balance sheet 

debt shortterm borrowings and longterm debt are accounted for at amortized cost except where the company has elected to report the debt instruments including certain structured notes at fair value or the debt is in a fair value hedging relationship 

transfers of financial assets for a transfer of financial assets to be considered a sale the assets must have been isolated from the company even in bankruptcy or other receivership the purchaser must have the right to pledge or sell the assets transferred or if the purchaser is an entity whose sole purpose is to engage in securitization and assetbacked financing activities and that entity is constrained from pledging the assets it receives each beneficial interest holder must have the right to sell the beneficial interests and the company may not have an option or obligation to reacquire the assets if these sale requirements are met the assets are removed from the company’s consolidated balance sheet if the conditions for sale are not met the transfer is considered to be a secured borrowing the assets remain on the consolidated balance sheet and the sale proceeds are recognized as the company’s liability a legal opinion on a sale is generally obtained for complex transactions or where the company has continuing involvement with assets transferred or with the securitization entity for a transfer to be eligible for sale accounting those opinions must state that the asset transfer is considered a sale and that the assets transferred would not be consolidated with the company’s other assets in the event of the company’s insolvency   for a transfer of a portion of a financial asset to be considered a sale the portion transferred must meet the definition of a participating interest a participating interest must represent a pro rata ownership in an entire financial asset all cash flows must be divided proportionally with the same priority of payment no participating interest in the transferred asset may be subordinated to the interest of another participating interest holder and no party may have the right to pledge or exchange the entire financial asset unless all participating interest holders agree otherwise the transfer is accounted for as a secured borrowing   see note 22 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

risk management activities–derivatives used for hedging purposes the company manages its exposures to market rate movements outside its trading activities by modifying the asset and liability mix either directly or through the use of derivative financial products including interestrate swaps futures forwards and purchased options as well as foreignexchange contracts these enduser derivatives are carried at fair value in other assets other liabilities trading account assets and trading account liabilities    to qualify as an accounting hedge under the hedge accounting rules versus a management hedge where hedge accounting is not sought a derivative must be highly effective in offsetting the risk designated as being hedged the hedge relationship must be formally documented at inception detailing the particular risk management objective and strategy for the hedge which includes the item and risk that is being hedged and the 

  144 

derivative that is being used as well as how effectiveness will be assessed and ineffectiveness measured the effectiveness of these hedging relationships is evaluated on a retrospective and prospective basis typically using quantitative measures of correlation with hedge ineffectiveness measured and recorded in current earnings   if a hedge relationship is found to be ineffective it no longer qualifies as an accounting hedge and hedge accounting would not be applied any gains or losses attributable to the derivatives as well as subsequent changes in fair value are recognized in other revenue or principal transactions with no offset on the hedged item similar to trading derivatives   the foregoing criteria are applied on a decentralized basis consistent with the level at which market risk is managed but are subject to various limits and controls the underlying asset liability or forecasted transaction may be an individual item or a portfolio of similar items   for fair value hedges in which derivatives hedge the fair value of assets or liabilities changes in the fair value of derivatives are reflected in other revenue or principal transactions  together with changes in the fair value of the hedged item related to the hedged risk these are expected to and generally do offset each other any net amount representing hedge ineffectiveness is reflected in current earnings citigroup’s fair value hedges are primarily hedges of fixedrate longterm debt and availableforsale securities   for cash flow hedges in which derivatives hedge the variability of cash flows related to floating and fixedrate assets liabilities or forecasted transactions the accounting treatment depends on the effectiveness of the hedge to the extent these derivatives are effective in offsetting the variability of the hedged cash flows the effective portion of the changes in the derivatives’ fair values will not be included in current earnings but is reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  these changes in fair value will be included in earnings of future periods when the hedged cash flows impact earnings to the extent these derivatives are not effective changes in their fair values are immediately included in other revenue  citigroup’s cash flow hedges primarily include hedges of floatingrate debt as well as rollovers of shortterm fixedrate liabilities and floatingrate liabilities and forecasted debt issuances   for net investment hedges in which derivatives hedge the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation the accounting treatment will similarly depend on the effectiveness of the hedge the effective portion of the change in fair value of the derivative including any forward premium or discount is reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income loss as part of the foreign currency translation adjustment   enduser derivatives that are economic hedges rather than qualifying for hedge accounting are also carried at fair value with changes in value included in principal transactions or other revenue  citigroup often uses economic hedges when qualifying for hedge accounting would be too complex or operationally burdensome examples are hedges of the credit risk component of commercial loans and loan commitments citigroup periodically evaluates its hedging strategies in other areas and may designate 

either a qualifying hedge or an economic hedge after considering the relative cost and benefits economic hedges are also employed when the hedged item itself is marked to market through current earnings such as hedges of commitments to originate onetofourfamily mortgage loans to be held for sale and msrs   for those accounting hedge relationships that are terminated or when hedge designations are removed the hedge accounting treatment described in the paragraphs above is no longer applied instead the enduser derivative is terminated or transferred to the trading account for fair value hedges any changes in the fair value of the hedged item remain as part of the basis of the asset or liability and are ultimately reflected as an element of the yield for cash flow hedges any changes in fair value of the enduser derivative remain in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and are included in earnings of future periods when the hedged cash flows impact earnings however if it becomes probable that the hedged forecasted transaction will not occur any amounts that remain in accumulated other comprehensive income loss are immediately reflected in other revenue  

employee benefits expense employee benefits expense includes current service costs of pension and other postretirement benefit plans which are accrued on a current basis contributions and unrestricted awards under other employee plans the amortization of restricted stock awards and costs of other employee benefits 

stockbased compensation the company recognizes compensation expense related to stock and option awards over the requisite service period generally based on the instruments’ grant date fair value reduced by expected forfeitures compensation cost related to awards granted to employees who meet certain age plus yearsofservice requirements retirement eligible employees is accrued in the year prior to the grant date in the same manner as the accrual for cash incentive compensation certain stock awards with performance conditions or certain clawback provisions are subject to variable accounting pursuant to which the associated charges fluctuate with changes in citigroup’s stock price 

income taxes the company is subject to the income tax laws of the us its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which the company operates these tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities in establishing a provision for income tax expense the company must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws the company must also make estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions both domestic and foreign   disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be subject to reviewadjudication by the court systems of the various tax jurisdictions or may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit the company treats interest and penalties on income taxes as a component of income tax expense  

  deferred taxes are recorded for the future consequences of events that have been recognized for financial statements or tax returns based upon enacted tax laws and rates deferred tax assets are recognized subject to management’s judgment that realization is more likely than not fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes” fin 48 now incorporated into asc 740 income taxes sets out a consistent framework to determine the appropriate level of tax reserves to maintain for uncertain tax positions this interpretation uses a twostep approach wherein a tax benefit is recognized if a position is more likely than not to be sustained the amount of the benefit is then measured to be the highest tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely to be realized fin 48 also sets out disclosure requirements to enhance transparency of an entity’s tax reserves   see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for a further description of the company’s provision and related income tax assets and liabilities 

commissions underwriting and principal transactions commissions revenues are recognized in income generally when earned underwriting revenues are recognized in income typically at the closing of the transaction principal transactions revenues are recognized in income on a tradedate basis see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the company’s revenue recognition policies for commissions and fees 

earnings per share earnings per share eps is computed after deducting preferred stock dividends the company has granted restricted and deferred share awards with dividend rights that are considered to be participating securities which are akin to a second class of common stock accordingly a portion of citigroup’s earnings is allocated to those participating securities in the eps calculation   basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders after the allocation of dividends and undistributed earnings to the participating securities by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised it is computed after giving consideration to the weighted average dilutive effect of the company’s stock options and warrants convertible securities tdecs and the shares that could have been issued under the company’s management committee longterm incentive plan and after the allocation of earnings to the participating securities   all per share amounts and citigroup shares outstanding for all periods reflect citigroup’s 1for10 reverse stock split which was effective may 6 2011 

use of estimates management must make estimates and assumptions that affect the consolidated financial statements and the related footnote disclosures such estimates are used in connection with certain fair value measurements see note 25 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussions on estimates used in the determination of fair value the company also uses estimates in determining consolidation decisions for specialpurpose entities as discussed in note 22 moreover estimates are significant in determining the amounts of otherthantemporary impairments impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets provisions for probable losses that may arise from creditrelated exposures and probable and estimable losses related to litigation and regulatory proceedings and tax reserves while management makes its best judgment actual amounts or results could differ from those estimates current market conditions increase the risk and complexity of the judgments in these estimates 

cash flows cash equivalents are defined as those amounts included in cash and due from banks cash flows from risk management activities are classified in the same category as the related assets and liabilities 

related party transactions the company has related party transactions with certain of its subsidiaries and affiliates these transactions which are primarily shortterm in nature include cash accounts collateralized financing transactions margin accounts derivative trading charges for operational support and the borrowing and lending of funds and are entered into in the ordinary course of business 

accounting changes 

credit quality and allowance for credit losses disclosures in july 2010 the fasb issued asu no 201020 receivables topic 310 disclosures about credit quality of financing receivables and allowance for credit losses  the asu required a greater level of disaggregated information about the allowance for credit losses and the credit quality of financing receivables the periodend balance disclosure requirements for loans and the allowance for loan losses were effective for reporting periods ending on or after december 15 2010 and were included in the company’s 2010 annual report on form 10k while disclosures for activity during a reporting period in the loan and allowance for loan losses accounts were effective for reporting periods beginning on or after december 15 2010 and were included in the company’s forms 10q beginning with the first quarter of 2011 see notes 16 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements the troubled debt restructuring disclosure requirements that were part of this asu became effective in the third quarter of 2011 see below 

troubled debt restructurings tdrs in april 2011 the fasb issued asu no 201102 receivables topic 310 a creditor’s determination of whether a restructuring is a troubled debt restructuring  to clarify the guidance for accounting for troubled debt restructurings the asu clarified the guidance on a creditor’s evaluation of whether it has granted a concession and whether a debtor is experiencing financial difficulties such as 

any shortfall in contractual loan payments is considered a concession creditors cannot assume that debt extensions at or above a borrower’s original contractual rate do not constitute troubled debt restructurings because the new contractual rate could still be below the market rate if a borrower doesn’t have access to funds at a market rate for debt with characteristics similar to the restructured debt that may indicate that the creditor has granted a concession 

a borrower that is not currently in default may still be considered to be experiencing financial difficulty when payment default is considered “probable in the foreseeable future” effective in the third quarter of 2011 as a result of adopting asu 201102 certain loans modified under shortterm programs since january 1 2011 that were previously measured for impairment under asc 450 are now measured for impairment under asc 3101035 at the end of the first interim period of adoption september 30 2011 the recorded investment in receivables previously measured under asc 450 was 1170 million and the allowance for credit losses associated with those loans was 467 million the effect of adopting the asu was approximately 60 million 

change in accounting for embedded credit derivatives in march 2010 the fasb issued asu 201011 scope exception related to embedded credit derivatives  the asu clarifies that certain embedded derivatives such as those contained in certain securitizations cdos and structured notes should be considered embedded credit derivatives subject to potential bifurcation and separate fair value accounting the asu allows any beneficial interest issued by a securitization vehicle to be accounted for under the fair value option at transition on july 1 2010   the company has elected to account for certain beneficial interests issued by securitization vehicles under the fair value option that are included in the table below beneficial interests previously classified as heldtomaturity htm were reclassified to availableforsale afs on june 30 2010 because as of that reporting date the company did not have the intent to hold the beneficial interests until maturity   the following table also shows the gross gains and gross losses that make up the pretax cumulativeeffect adjustment to retained earnings for reclassified beneficial interests recorded on july 1 2010 

    147

elimination of qualifying special purpose entities qspes and changes in the consolidation model for vies in june 2009 the fasb issued sfas no 166 accounting for transfers of financial assets an amendment of fasb statement no 140 sfas 166 now incorporated into asc topic 860 and sfas no 167 amendments to fasb interpretation no 46r sfas 167 now incorporated into asc topic 810 citigroup adopted both standards on january 1 2010 citigroup has elected to apply sfas 166 and sfas 167 prospectively accordingly prior periods have not been restated   sfas 166 eliminates the concept of qspes from us gaap and amends the guidance on accounting for transfers of financial assets sfas 167 details three key changes to the consolidation model first former qspes are now included in the scope of sfas 167 second the fasb has changed the method of analyzing which party to a vie should consolidate the vie known as the primary beneficiary to a qualitative determination of which party to the vie has “power” combined with potentially significant benefits or losses instead of the previous quantitative risks and rewards model the party that has “power” has the ability to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the vie’s economic performance third the new standard requires that the primary beneficiary analysis be reevaluated whenever circumstances change the previous rules required reconsideration of the primary beneficiary only when specified reconsideration events occurred 

  as a result of implementing these new accounting standards citigroup consolidated certain of the vies and former qspes with which it had involvement on january 1 2010 further certain asset transfers including transfers of portions of assets that would have been considered sales under sfas 140 are considered secured borrowings under the new standards   in accordance with sfas 167 citigroup employed three approaches for newly consolidating certain vies and former qspes as of january 1 2010 the first approach requires initially measuring the assets liabilities and noncontrolling interests of the vies and former qspes at their carrying values the amounts at which the assets liabilities and noncontrolling interests would have been carried in the consolidated financial statements if citigroup had always consolidated these vies and former qspes the second approach measures assets at their unpaid principal amount and is applied when determining carrying values is not practicable the third approach is to elect the fair value option in which all of the financial assets and liabilities of certain designated vies and former qspes are recorded at fair value upon adoption of sfas 167 and continue to be marked to market thereafter with changes in fair value reported in earnings   citigroup consolidated all required vies and former qspes as of january 1 2010 at carrying values or unpaid principal amounts except for certain private label residential mortgage and mutual fund deferred sales commissions vies for which the fair value option was elected the following tables present the impact of adopting these new accounting standards applying these approaches 

  the incremental impact of these changes on gaap assets and resulting riskweighted assets for those vies and former qspes that were consolidated or deconsolidated for accounting purposes as of january 1 2010 was as follows 

 

  the following table reflects the incremental impact of adopting sfas 166167 on citigroup’s gaap assets liabilities and stockholders’ equity 

   the preceding tables reflect i the portion of the assets of former qspes to which citigroup acting as principal had transferred assets and received sales treatment prior to january 1 2010 totaling approximately 7120 billion and ii the assets of significant vies as of january 1 2010 with which citigroup was involved totaling approximately 2192 billion that were previously unconsolidated and are required to be consolidated under the new accounting standards due to the variety of transaction structures and the level of citigroup’s involvement in individual former qspes and vies only a portion of the former qspes and vies with which the company was involved were required to be consolidated   in addition the cumulative effect of adopting these new accounting standards as of january 1 2010 resulted in an aggregate aftertax charge to retained earnings of 84 billion reflecting the net effect of an overall pretax charge to retained earnings primarily relating to the establishment of loan loss reserves and the reversal of residual interests held of 134 billion and the recognition of related deferred tax assets amounting to 50 billion

a valuation technique that uses quoted prices for similar liabilities or an identical liability when traded as assets or another valuation technique that is consistent with the principles of asc 820   this asu also clarifies that both a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability at the measurement date and the quoted price for the identical liability when traded as an asset in an active market when no adjustments to the quoted price of the asset are required are level 1 fair value measurements this asu did not have a material impact on the company’s fair value measurements

  continuous employment within citigroup is generally required to vest in cap and other stock award programs typical exceptions include vesting for participants whose employment is terminated involuntarily during the vesting period for a reason other than “gross misconduct” who meet specified age and service requirements before leaving employment retirementeligible participants or who die or become disabled during the vesting period postemployment vesting by retirementeligible participants is generally conditioned upon their refraining from competition with citigroup during the remaining vesting period   in a change from prior years incentive awards in january 2012 to individual employees who have influence over the company’s material risks covered employees were delivered as a mix of immediate cash bonuses deferred stock awards under cap and deferred cash awards previously annual incentives were traditionally awarded as a combination of cash bonus and cap for covered employees the minimum percentage of incentive pay required to be deferred was raised from 25 to 40 with a maximum deferral of 60 for the most highly paid employees for incentive awards made to covered employees in january 2012 in respect of 2011 performance only 50 of the deferred portion was delivered as a cap award the other 50 was delivered in the form of a deferred cash award the 2012 deferred cash award is subject to a performancebased vesting condition that results in cancellation of unvested amounts on a formulaic basis if a participant’s business has losses in any year of the vesting period the 2012 deferred cash award also earns notional interest at an annual rate of 355 compounded annually   cap awards made in january 2012 and january 2011 to “identified staff” in the european union eu have several features that differ from the generally applicable cap provisions described above “identified staff” are those citigroup employees whose compensation is subject to various banking regulations on sound incentive compensation policies in the eu cap awards to these employees are scheduled to vest over three years of service but vested shares are subject to a sixmonth sale restriction and awards are subject to cancellation in the sole discretion of the committee if a there is reasonable evidence a participant engaged in misconduct or committed material error in connection with his or her employment or b the company or the employee’s business unit suffers a material downturn in its financial performance or a material failure of risk management the eu clawback for these cap awards the eu clawback is in addition to the clawback provision described below cap awards containing the eu clawback provision are subject to variable accounting 

  a portion of the immediately vested cash incentive compensation awarded in january 2011 to selected highly compensated employees and in january 2012 to such employees in the eu was delivered in immediatelyvested stock payments in the eu the shares awarded were subject to a sixmonth sale restriction   annual incentive awards made in january 2011 january 2010 and december 2009 to certain executive officers and highly compensated employees were made in the form of longterm restricted stock ltrs with terms prescribed by the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 as amended see eesarelated stock compensation below for additional information   the annual incentive awards made in january 2011 to executive officers have a performancebased vesting condition if citigroup has pretax net losses during any of the years of the deferral period the committee may exercise its discretion to eliminate or reduce the number of shares that vest for that year this performancebased vesting condition applies to cap and ltrs awards made in january 2011 to executive officers these awards are subject to variable accounting compensation expense was accrued based on citigroup’s stock price at year end and the estimated outcome of meeting the performance conditions   all cap awards made in january 2011 and 2012 and all ltrs awards made in january 2011 provide for a clawback that applies to specified cases including in the case of employee misconduct or where the awards were based on earnings that were misstated some of these awards are subject to variable accounting   generally in order to reduce the use of shares under citigroup’s stockholderapproved stock incentive plan the percentages of total annual incentives awarded pursuant to cap in january 2010 and january 2009 were reduced and were instead awarded as deferred cash awards primarily in the us and the uk the deferred cash awards are subject to twoyear and fouryear vesting schedules but the other terms and conditions are the same as cap awards made in those years the deferred cash awards earn a return during the vesting period based on libor in 2010 only a portion of the deferred cash award was denominated as a stock unit the value of which will fluctuate based on the price of citi common stock in both cases only cash will be delivered at vesting   in january 2009 members of the management executive committee except the ceo and cfo received 30 of their incentive awards for 2008 as performance vestingequity awards these awards vest 50 if the price of citigroup common stock meets a price target of 10610 and 50 for a price target of 17850 in each case on or prior to january 14 2013 the price target will be met only if the nyse closing price equals or exceeds the applicable price target for at least 20 nyse trading days within any period of 30 consecutive nyse trading days ending on or before january 14 2013 any shares that have not vested by such date will vest according to a fraction the numerator of which is the share price on the delivery date and the denominator of which is the price target of the unvested shares no dividend 

equivalents are paid on unvested awards the fair value of the awards is recognized as compensation expense ratably over the vesting period this fair value was determined using the following assumptions 

   from 2003 to 2007 citigroup granted annual stock awards under its citigroup ownership program cop to a broad base of employees who were not eligible for cap the cop awards of restricted or deferred stock vest after three years but otherwise have terms similar to cap amortization of restricted and deferred stock awards shown in the table above for 2010 and 2009 includes expense associated with these awards 

eesarelated stock compensation incentive compensation in respect of 2009 performance for the senior executive officers and the next 95 most highly compensated employees 2009 top 100 was administered in accordance with the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 as amended eesa pursuant to structures approved by the special master for tarp executive compensation special master pursuant to such structures the affected employees did not participate in cap and instead received equity compensation in the form of fully vested stock payments ltrs and other restricted and deferred stock awards subject to vesting requirements and sale restrictions the other restricted and deferred stock awards to the 2009 top 100 vest ratably over three years pursuant to terms similar to cap awards but vested shares are subject to sale restrictions until the later of the first anniversary of the regularly scheduled vesting date or january 20 2013 pursuant to eesaprescribed structures incentive compensation in respect of 2010 performance was delivered to the senior executive officers and next 20 most highly compensated employees for 2010 2010 top 25 in the form of ltrs awards the ltrs awards to the 2009 top 100 and 2010 top 25 vest in full after three years of service and there are no provisions for early vesting in the event of retirement involuntary termination of employment or change in control but early vesting will occur upon death or disability   in 2009 and january 2010 the 2009 top 100 received salary stock payments that become transferrable in monthly installments over periods of either one year or three years beginning in january 2010 in september 2010 salary stock payments were made to the 2010 top 25 other than the ceo in a manner consistent with the salary stock payments made in 2009 pursuant to rulings issued by the special master the salary stock paid for 2010 net of tax withholdings is transferable over a 12month period beginning in january 2011 there are no provisions for early release of the transfer restrictions on salary stock in the event of retirement involuntary termination of employment change in control or any other reason 

  in connection with its agreement to repay 20 billion of its tarp obligations to the us treasury department in december 2009 citigroup announced that 17 billion of incentive compensation that would have otherwise been awarded in cash to employees in respect of 2009 performance would instead be awarded as “common stock equivalent” awards denominated in us dollars or in local currency that were settled by stock payments in april 2010 the awards were generally accrued as compensation expense in the year 2009 and were recorded as a liability from the january 2010 grant date until the settlement date in april 2010 the recorded liability was reclassified to equity when newly issued shares were delivered to participating employees on the settlement date 

signon and longterm awards from time to time restricted or deferred stock awards andor stock option grants are made outside of the annual incentive program to induce talented employees to join citigroup or as special retention awards to key employees vesting periods vary but are generally two to four years generally recipients must remain employed through the vesting dates to vest in the awards except in cases of death disability or involuntary termination other than for “gross misconduct” unlike cap these awards do not usually provide for postemployment vesting by retirementeligible participants   on may 17 2011 the committee approved a deferred stock retention award to ceo vikram pandit the award vests in three equal installments on december 31 2013 december 31 2014 and december 31 2015 if the committee determines that he has satisfied discretionary performance criteria dealing with regulatory compliance citi culture and talent management and mr pandit remains employed through the vesting date any vested shares from the december 31 2013 and december 31 2014 vestings will be salerestricted until december 31 2015 this award is subject to variable accounting   on july 17 2007 the committee approved the management committee longterm incentive plan mc ltip pursuant to the terms of the shareholderapproved 1999 stock incentive plan under which participants received an equity award that could be earned based on citigroup’s performance against various metrics relative to peer companies and publicly stated return on equity roe targets measured at the end of each calendar year beginning with 2007 the final expense for each of the three consecutive calendar years was adjusted based on the results of the roe tests no awards were earned for 2009 2008 or 2007 and no shares were issued because performance targets were not met no new awards were made under the mc ltip since the initial award in july 2007

other incentive compensation citigroup may at times issue cash in lieu of equity awards which are deferred cash awards given to new hires in replacement of prior employer’s awards or other forfeited compensation the vesting schedules and terms and conditions of these deferred cash awards are generally structured to match the terms of awards or other compensation from a prior employer that was forfeited to accept employment with the company expense taken in 2011 for these awards was 172 million   additionally certain subsidiaries or business units of the company operate and may from time to time introduce other incentive plans for certain employees that have an incentivebased award component these awards are not considered material to citigroup’s operations 

9 retirement benefits 

pension and postretirement plans the company has several noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering certain us employees and has various defined benefit pension and termination indemnity plans covering employees outside the united states the us qualified defined benefit plan was frozen effective january 1 2008 for most employees accordingly no additional compensationbased contributions were credited to the cash balance portion of the plan for existing plan participants after 2007 however certain employees covered under the prior final pay plan formula continue to accrue benefits the company also offers postretirement health care and life insurance benefits to certain eligible us retired employees as well as to certain eligible employees outside the united states   the following table summarizes the components of net benefit expense recognized in the consolidated statement of income for the company’s us qualified and nonqualified pension plans postretirement plans and plans outside the united states the company uses a december 31 measurement date for its us and nonus plans 

contributions citigroup’s funding policy for us and nonus pension plans is generally to fund to minimum funding requirements in accordance with applicable local laws and regulations the company may increase its contributions above the minimum required contribution if appropriate for the us pension plans at december 31 2011 and 2010 there were no minimum required cash contributions during 2010 a discretionary cash contribution of 995 million was made to the plan for the us nonqualified pension plans the company contributed 51 million in benefits paid directly during 2011 51 million during 2010 and 55 million during 2009 no contributions are expected for the us qualified pension plan for 2012 and 53 million of direct payments are expected for the us nonqualified plans for 2012   for the nonus pension plans the company reported 389 million in employer contributions during 2011 which includes 47 million in benefits paid directly by the company for the nonus pension plans discretionary cash contributions for 2012 are anticipated to be approximately 211 million in addition the company expects to contribute 43 million of benefits to be paid directly by the company for its nonus pension plans for the us postretirement benefit plans there are no expected or required contributions for 2012 other than 55 million of benefit payments expected to be paid directly by the company   for the nonus postretirement benefit plans the company reported 75 million in employer contributions during 2011 which includes 5 million in benefits paid directly by the company during the year for the nonus postretirement benefit plans expected cash contributions for 2012 are 83 million including 4 million of benefits to be paid directly by the company   these estimates are subject to change since contribution decisions are affected by various factors such as market performance and regulatory requirements in addition management has the ability to change funding policy

plan assumptions citigroup utilizes a number of assumptions to determine plan obligations and expense changes in one or a combination of these assumptions will have an impact on the company’s pension and postretirement pbo funded status and benefit expense changes in the plans’ funded status resulting from changes in the pbo and fair value of plan assets will have a corresponding impact on accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a discussion of certain assumptions follows 

discount rate the discount rates for the us pension and postretirement plans were selected by reference to a citigroupspecific analysis using each plan’s specific cash flows and compared with high quality corporate bond indices for reasonableness citigroup’s policy is to round to the nearest five hundredths of a percent accordingly at december 31 2011 the discount rate was set at 470 for the pension plans and 430 for the postretirement plans at december 31 2010 the discount rate was set at 545 for the pension plans and 510 for the postretirement plans referencing a citigroupspecific cash flow analysis   the discount rates for the nonus pension and postretirement plans are selected by reference to high quality corporate bond rates in countries that have developed corporate bond markets however where developed corporate bond markets do not exist the discount rates are selected by reference to local government bond rates with a premium added to reflect the additional risk for corporate bonds 

  the discount rate and future rate of compensation assumptions used in determining pension and postretirement benefit obligations and net benefit expense for the company’s plans are shown in the following table 

 

a onepercentagepoint change in the discount rates would have the following effects on pension expense

 expected rate of return citigroup determines its assumptions for the expected rate of return on plan assets for its us pension and postretirement plans using a “building block” approach which focuses on ranges of anticipated rates of return for each asset class a weighted range of nominal rates is then determined based on target allocations to each asset class market performance over a number of earlier years is evaluated covering a wide range of economic conditions to determine whether there are sound reasons for projecting any past trends   citigroup considers the expected rate of return to be a longterm assessment of return expectations and does not anticipate changing this assumption annually unless there are significant changes in investment strategy or economic conditions this contrasts with the selection of the discount rate future compensation increase rate and certain other assumptions which are reconsidered annually in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 

  the expected rate of return for the us pension and postretirement plans was 750 at december 31 2011 750 at december 31 2010 and 775 at december 31 2009 reflecting a change in investment allocations during 2010 actual returns in 2011 and 2010 were greater than the expected returns while actual returns in 2009 were less than the expected returns this expected amount reflects the expected annual appreciation of the plan assets and reduces the annual pension expense of citigroup it is deducted from the sum of service cost interest and other components of pension expense to arrive at the net pension benefit expense net pension benefit expense for the us pension plans for 2011 2010 and 2009 reflects deductions of 890 million 874 million and 912 million of expected returns respectively   the following table shows the expected versus actual rate of return on plan assets for 2011 2010 and 2009 for the us pension and postretirement plans 

    for the nonus plans pension expense for 2011 was reduced by the expected return of 422 million compared with the actual return of 526 million pension expense for 2010 and 2009 was reduced by expected returns of 378 million and 336 million respectively actual returns were higher in 2011 2010 and 2009 than the expected returns in those years   the expected longterm rates of return on assets used in determining the company’s pension expense are shown below

  investment strategy citigroup’s global pension and postretirement funds’ investment strategies are to invest in a prudent manner for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits to participants the investment strategies are targeted to produce a total return that when combined with citigroup’s contributions to the funds will maintain the funds’ ability to meet all required benefit obligations risk is controlled through diversification of asset types and investments in domestic and international equities fixedincome securities and cash and shortterm investments the target asset allocation in most locations outside the us is to have the majority of the assets in equity and debt securities these allocations may vary by geographic region and country depending on the nature of applicable obligations and various other regional considerations the wide variation in the actual range of plan asset allocations for the funded nonus plans is a result of differing local statutory requirements and economic conditions for example in certain countries local law requires that all pension plan assets must be invested in fixedincome investments government funds or localcountry securities 

significant concentrations of risk in plan assets the assets of citigroup’s pension plans are diversified to limit the impact of any individual investment the us pension plan is diversified across multiple asset classes with publicly traded fixed income hedge funds and private equity representing the most significant asset allocations investments in these three asset classes are further diversified across funds managers strategies vintages sectors and geographies depending on the specific characteristics of each asset class the pension assets for citigroup’s largest nonus plans are primarily invested in publicly traded fixed income and publicly traded equity securities 

oversight and risk management practices the framework for citigroup’s pensions oversight process includes monitoring of retirement plans by plan fiduciaries andor management at the global regional or country level as appropriate independent risk management contributes to the risk oversight and monitoring for citigroup’s us pension plans and largest nonus pension plans although the specific components of the oversight process are tailored to the requirements of each region country and plan the following elements are common to citigroup’s monitoring and risk management process 

periodic assetliability management studies and strategic asset allocation reviews periodic monitoring of funding levels and funding ratios periodic monitoring of compliance with asset allocation guidelines periodic monitoring of asset class andor investment manager performance against benchmarks periodic risk capital analysis and stress testing

actuarially equivalent to medicare part d the benefits provided to certain participants are at least actuarially equivalent to medicare part d and accordingly the company is entitled to a subsidy   the expected subsidy reduced the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation apbo by approximately 96 million and 139 million as of december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively and the postretirement expense by approximately 10 million and 9 million for 2011 and 2010 respectively 

the following table shows the estimated future benefit payments without the effect of the subsidy and the amounts of the expected subsidy in future years 

   the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 collectively the act of 2010 were signed into law in the us in march 2010 one provision that impacted citigroup was the elimination of the tax deductibility for benefits paid that are related to the medicare part d subsidy starting in 2013 citigroup was required to recognize the full accounting impact in 2010 the period in which the act of 2010 was signed as a result there was a 45 million reduction in deferred tax assets with a corresponding charge to earnings from continuing operations the other provisions of the act of 2010 are not expected to have a significant impact on citigroup’s pension and postretirement plans 

defined contribution plans citigroup administers defined contribution plans in the us and in certain nonus locations all of which are administered in accordance with local laws the most significant plan of these plans is the citigroup 401k plan in the us   under the citigroup 401k plan eligible us employees received matching contributions of up to 6 of their compensation for 2011 and up to 4 for 2010 subject to statutory limits the matching contribution is invested according to participants’ individual elections additionally for eligible employees whose compensation is 100000 or less a fixed contribution of up to 2 of compensation is provided the matching 

and fixed contributions are invested according to participants’ individual elections the pretax expense associated with this plan amounted to approximately 383 million 301 million and 442 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively the change in expense yearoveryear reflects the fluctuations of the matching contribution rate 

postemployment plans citigroup sponsors us postemployment plans that provide income continuation and health and welfare benefits to certain eligible us employees on long term disability for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 the plans’ funded status recognized in the company’s consolidated balance sheet was 469 million and 436 million respectively the net expense recognized in the consolidated statement of income during 2011 2010 and 2009 were 67 million 69 million and 57 million respectively the estimated net actuarial loss and prior service cost that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income loss into net expense in 2012 are approximately 169 million and 19 million respectively 

10 income taxes 

 

  the reconciliation of the federal statutory income tax rate to the company’s effective income tax rate applicable to income from continuing operations before noncontrolling interests and the cumulative effect of accounting changes for the years ended december 31 was as follows 

  deferred income taxes at december 31 related to the following 

 

the following is a rollforward of the company’s unrecognized tax benefits 

 

  total amount of unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 that if recognized would affect the effective tax rate are 22 billion 21 billion and 22 billion respectively the remainder of the uncertain tax positions have offsetting amounts in other jurisdictions or are temporary differences except for 09 billion at december 31 2011 which would be booked directly to retained earnings 

interest and penalties not included in “unrecognized tax benefits” above are a component of the provision for income taxes  

    the company is currently under audit by the internal revenue service and other major taxing jurisdictions around the world it is thus reasonably possible that significant changes in the gross balance of unrecognized tax benefits may occur within the next 12 months but the company does not expect such audits to result in amounts that would cause a significant change to its effective tax rate other than the following items   the company expects to conclude the irs audit of its us federal consolidated income tax returns for the years 20062008 and may resolve certain issues with irs appeals for the years 20032005 within the next 12 months the gross uncertain tax positions at december 31 2011 for the items that may be resolved for 20032008 are as much as 1510 million plus gross interest of 70 million because of the number of issues remaining to be resolved the potential tax benefit to continuing operations could be anywhere in a range between 0 and 1200 million in addition the company expects to conclude a new york city audit for 20062008 in the first quarter of 2012 that will result in a reduction of approximately 82 million in gross uncertain tax positions and a reduction in gross interest of approximately 13 million and which could result in a tax benefit to continuing operations of approximately 56 million   the following are the major tax jurisdictions in which the company and its affiliates operate and the earliest tax year subject to examination 

 

  foreign pretax earnings approximated 131 billion in 2011 123 billion in 2010 and 61 billion in 2009 of which 02 billion profit 01 billion profit and 06 billion loss respectively are in discontinued operations as a us corporation citigroup and its us subsidiaries are currently subject to us taxation on all foreign pretax earnings earned by a foreign branch pretax earnings of a foreign subsidiary or affiliate are subject to us taxation when effectively repatriated the company provides income taxes on the undistributed earnings of nonus subsidiaries except to the extent that such earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the united states at december 31 2011 359 billion of accumulated undistributed earnings of nonus subsidiaries were indefinitely invested at the existing us federal income tax rate additional taxes net of us foreign tax credits of 95 billion would have to be provided if such earnings were remitted currently the current year’s effect on the income tax expense from continuing operations is included in the “foreign income tax rate differential” line in the reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the company’s effective income tax rate in the table above   income taxes are not provided for the company’s “savings bank base year bad debt reserves” that arose before 1988 because under current us tax rules such taxes will become payable only to the extent such amounts are distributed in excess of limits prescribed by federal law at december 31 2011 the amount of the base year reserves totaled approximately 358 million subject to a tax of 125 million 

  the company has no valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets dtas at december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 

 

  the following table summarizes the amounts of tax carryforwards and their expiration dates as of december 31 2011 

 

  although realization is not assured the company believes that the realization of the recognized net dta of 515 billion at december 31 2011 is more likely than not based upon expectations as to future taxable income in the jurisdictions in which the dtas arise and available tax planning strategies as defined in asc 740 income taxes formerly sfas 109 that would be implemented if necessary to prevent a carryforward from expiring   in general citi would need to generate approximately 111 billion of taxable income during the respective carryforward periods to fully realize its us federal state and local dtas citi’s net dtas will decline primarily as additional domestic gaap taxable income is generated   as of december 31 2011 citi was no longer in a threeyear cumulative loss position for purposes of evaluating its dtas while this removes a significant piece of negative evidence in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance citi will continue to weigh the evidence supporting its dtas citi has concluded that there are two pieces of positive evidence which support the full realizability of its dtas first citi forecasts sufficient taxable income in the carryforward period exclusive of tax planning strategies second citi has sufficient tax planning strategies including potential sales of assets in which it could realize the excess of appreciated value over the tax basis of its assets the amount of the dtas considered realizable however is necessarily subject to citi’s estimates of future taxable income in the jurisdictions in which it operates during the respective carryforward periods which is in turn subject to overall market and global economic conditions   the us federal consolidated tax return nol carryforward component of the dtas of 38 billion at december 31 2010 was utilized in 2011 based upon the foregoing discussion as well as tax planning opportunities and other factors discussed below citi believes the us federal and new york state and city nol carryforward period of 20 years provides enough time to fully utilize the dtas pertaining to the existing nol carryforwards and any nol that would be created by the reversal of the future net deductions that have not yet been taken on a tax return   because the us federal consolidated tax return nol carryforward has been utilized citi can begin to utilize its foreign tax credit ftc and general business credit gbc carryforwards the us ftc carryforward period is 10 years utilization of foreign tax credits in any year is restricted to 35 of foreign source taxable income in that year however overall domestic losses that the company has incurred of approximately 56 billion as of december 31 2011 are allowed to be reclassified as foreign source income to the extent of 50 of domestic source income produced in subsequent years and such resulting foreign source income would in fact be sufficient to cover the foreign tax credits being carried forward as such citi believes the foreign source taxable income limitation will not be an impediment to the foreign tax credit carryforward usage as long as citi can generate sufficient domestic taxable income within the 10year carryforward period 

  regarding the estimate of future taxable income citi has projected its pretax earnings predominantly based upon the “core” businesses that citi intends to conduct going forward these “core” businesses have produced steady and strong earnings in the past citi believes that it will generate sufficient pretax earnings within the 10year carryforward period referenced above to be able to fully utilize the foreign tax credit carryforward in addition to any foreign tax credits produced in such period   as mentioned above citi has also examined tax planning strategies available to it in accordance with asc 740 that would be employed if necessary to prevent a carryforward from expiring and to accelerate the usage of its carryforwards these strategies include repatriating low taxed foreign source earnings for which an assertion that the earnings have been indefinitely reinvested has not been made accelerating us taxable income into or deferring us tax deductions out of the latter years of the carryforward period eg selling appreciated intangible assets and electing straightline depreciation accelerating deductible temporary differences outside the us holding onto availableforsale debt securities with losses until they mature and selling certain assets that produce tax exempt income while purchasing assets that produce fully taxable income in addition the sale or restructuring of certain businesses can produce significant us taxable income within the relevant carryforward periods   as previously disclosed citi’s ability to utilize its dtas to offset future taxable income may be significantly limited if citi experiences an “ownership change” as defined in section 382 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code generally an ownership change will occur if there is a cumulative change in citi’s ownership by “5 shareholders” as defined in the code that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling threeyear period any limitation on citi’s ability to utilize its dtas arising from an ownership change under section 382 will depend on the value of citi’s stock at the time of the ownership change 

11 earnings per share 

the following is a reconciliation of the income and share data used in the basic and diluted earnings per share eps computations for the years ended december 31 

    during 2011 2010 and 2009 weightedaverage options to purchase 241 million 386 million and 166 million shares of common stock respectively were outstanding but not included in the computation of earnings per share because the weightedaverage exercise prices of 12347 10289 and 31565 respectively were greater than the average market price of the company’s common stock   warrants issued to the us treasury as part of tarp and the losssharing agreement all of which were subsequently sold to the public in january 2011 with exercise prices of 17850 and 10610 for approximately 210 million and 255 million shares of common stock respectively were not included in the computation of earnings per share in 2010 and 2009 because they were antidilutive 

  equity awards granted under the management committee longterm incentive plan mc ltip were not included in the 2009 computation of earnings per share because the performance targets under the terms of the awards were not met and as a result the awards expired in the first quarter of 2010   the final tranche of equity units held by the abu dhabi investment authority adia converted into 59 million shares of citigroup common stock during the third quarter of 2011 equity units of approximately 118 million shares and 235 million shares of citigroup common stock held by adia were not included in the computation of earnings per share in 2010 and 2009 respectively because the exercise price of 31830 was greater than the average market price of the company’s common stock

federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell at their respective carrying values consisted of the following at december 31 

    federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase at their respective carrying values consisted of the following at december 31 

    the resale and repurchase agreements represent collateralized financing transactions the company executes these transactions through its brokerdealer subsidiaries to facilitate customer matchedbook activity and to efficiently fund a portion of the company’s trading inventory transactions executed by the company’s bank subsidiaries primarily facilitate customer financing activity   it is the company’s policy to take possession of the underlying collateral monitor its market value relative to the amounts due under the agreements and when necessary require prompt transfer of additional collateral in order to maintain contractual margin protection collateral typically consists of government and governmentagency securities corporate and municipal bonds and mortgagebacked and other assetbacked securities in the event of counterparty default the financing agreement provides the company with the right to liquidate the collateral held   the majority of the resale and repurchase agreements are recorded at fair value the remaining portion is carried at the amount of cash initially advanced or received plus accrued interest as specified in the respective agreements 

  a majority of securities borrowing and lending agreements are recorded at the amount of cash advanced or received and are collateralized principally by government and governmentagency securities and corporate debt and equity securities the remaining portion is recorded at fair value as the company elected the fair value option for certain securities borrowed and loaned portfolios with respect to securities loaned the company receives cash collateral in an amount generally in excess of the market value of the securities loaned the company monitors the market value of securities borrowed and securities loaned on a daily basis and obtains or posts additional collateral in order to maintain contractual margin protection

overview 

  securities availableforsale the amortized cost and fair value of securities availableforsale afs at december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 were as follows 

     at december 31 2011 the amortized cost of approximately 4000 investments in equity and fixedincome securities exceeded their fair value by 3377 billion of the 3377 billion the gross unrealized loss on equity securities was 195 million of the remainder 362 million represents fixedincome investments that have been in a grossunrealizedloss position for less than a year and of these 99 are rated investment grade 2820 billion represents fixedincome investments that have been in a grossunrealizedloss position for a year or more and of these 95 are rated investment grade   the afs mortgagebacked securities portfolio fair value balance of 51025 billion consists of 45781 billion of governmentsponsored agency securities and 5244 billion of privately sponsored securities of which the majority is backed by mortgages that are not alta or subprime 

  as discussed in more detail below the company conducts and documents periodic reviews of all securities with unrealized losses to evaluate whether the impairment is other than temporary any creditrelated impairment related to debt securities the company does not plan to sell and is not likely to be required to sell is recognized in the consolidated statement of income with the noncreditrelated impairment recognized in aoci for other impaired debt securities the entire impairment is recognized in the consolidated statement of income 

  the table below shows the fair value of afs securities that have been in an unrealized loss position for less than 12 months or for 12 months or longer as of december 31 2011 and december 31 2010

  the following table presents the amortized cost and fair value of afs debt securities by contractual maturity dates as of december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 

  the following table presents interest and dividends on investments 

 the following table presents realized gains and losses on all investments the gross realized investment losses exclude losses from otherthantemporary impairment 



during 2010 and 2011 the company sold several corporate debt securities and various mortgagebacked and assetbacked securities that were classified as heldtomaturity these sales were in response to a significant deterioration in the creditworthiness of the issuers or securities the corporate debt securities sold during 2010 had a carrying value of 413 million and the company recorded a realized loss of 49 million the mortgagebacked and assetbacked securities sold during 2011 had a carrying value of 1612 million and the company recorded a realized loss of 299 million 

debt securities heldtomaturity the carrying value and fair value of debt securities heldtomaturity htm at december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 were as follows 

    the company has the positive intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity absent any unforeseen further significant changes in circumstances including deterioration in credit or with regard to regulatory capital requirements   the net unrealized losses classified in aoci relate to debt securities reclassified from afs investments to htm investments in a prior year additionally for htm securities that have suffered credit impairment declines in fair value for reasons other than credit losses are recorded in aoci the aoci balance was 23 billion as of december 31 2011 compared 

to 50 billion as of december 31 2010 the aoci balance for htm securities is amortized over the remaining life of the related securities as an adjustment of yield in a manner consistent with the accretion of discount on the same debt securities this will have no impact on the company’s net income because the amortization of the unrealized holding loss reported in equity will offset the effect on interest income of the accretion of the discount on these securities   for any creditrelated impairment on htm securities the credit loss component is recognized in earnings 

  during the first quarter of 2011 the company determined that it no longer had the intent to hold 127 billion of htm securities to maturity as a result the company reclassified 100 billion carrying value of mortgagebacked other assetbacked state and municipal and corporate debt securities from investments heldtomaturity to trading account assets  the company also sold an additional 27 billion of such htm securities recognizing a corresponding receivable from the unsettled sales as of march 31 2011 as a result of these actions a net pretax loss of 709 million 427 million after tax was recognized in the consolidated statement of income for the three months ended march 31 2011 composed of gross unrealized gains of 311 million included in other revenue  gross unrealized losses of 1387 million included in otherthantemporaryimpairment losses on investments  and net realized gains of 367 million included in realized gains losses on sales of investments  prior to the reclassification unrealized losses totalling 1656 million pretax 1012 million after tax had been reflected in aoci see table below and have now been reflected in the consolidated statement of income as detailed above 

  citigroup reclassified and sold the securities as part of its overall efforts to mitigate its riskweighted assets rwa in order to comply with significant new regulatory capital requirements which although not yet implemented or formally adopted are nonetheless currently being used to assess the forecasted capital adequacy of the company and other large us banking organizations these regulatory capital changes which were largely unforeseen when the company initially reclassified the debt securities from trading account assets and investments availableforsale to investments heldtomaturity in the fourth quarter of 2008 see note 1 to the table below include i the us basel ii credit and operational risk capital standards ii the basel committee’s agreedupon and the usproposed revisions to the market risk capital rules which significantly increased the risk weightings for certain trading book positions iii the basel committee’s substantial issuance of basel iii which raised the quantity and quality of required regulatory capital and materially increased rwa for securitization exposures and iv certain regulatory capitalrelated provisions in the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 

through december 31 2011 the company has sold substantially all of the 127 billion of htm securities that were reclassified to trading account assets in the first quarter of 2011 the carrying value and fair value of debt securities at the date of reclassification or sale were as follows 

  188 

  the table below shows the fair value of debt securities in htm that have been in an unrecognized loss position for less than 12 months or for 12 months or longer as of december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 

   excluded from the gross unrecognized losses presented in the above table are the 23 billion and 50 billion of gross unrealized losses recorded in aoci as of december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 respectively mainly related to the htm securities that were reclassified from afs investments 

virtually all of these unrecognized losses relate to securities that have been in a loss position for 12 months or longer at both december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 

the following table presents the carrying value and fair value of htm debt securities by contractual maturity dates as of december 31 2011 and december 31 2010

evaluating investments for otherthantemporary impairments the company conducts and documents periodic reviews of all securities with unrealized losses to evaluate whether the impairment is other than temporary   under the guidance for debt securities otherthantemporary impairment otti is recognized in earnings for debt securities that the company has an intent to sell or that the company believes it is morelikelythannot that it will be required to sell prior to recovery of the amortized cost basis for those securities that the company does not intend to sell or expect to be required to sell creditrelated impairment is recognized in earnings with the noncreditrelated impairment recorded in aoci   an unrealized loss exists when the current fair value of an individual security is less than its amortized cost basis unrealized losses that are determined to be temporary in nature are recorded net of tax in aoci for afs securities while such losses related to htm securities are not recorded as these investments are carried at their amortized cost for securities transferred to htm from trading account assets amortized cost is defined as the fair value of the securities at the date of transfer plus any accretion income and less any impairment recognized in earnings subsequent to transfer for securities transferred to htm from afs amortized cost is defined as the original purchase cost plus or minus any accretion or amortization of a purchase discount or premium less any impairment recognized in earnings   regardless of the classification of the securities as afs or htm the company has assessed each position with an unrealized loss for otti factors considered in determining whether a loss is temporary include 

the length of time and the extent to which fair value has been below cost the severity of the impairment the cause of the impairment and the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the issuer activity in the market of the issuer that may indicate adverse credit conditions and the company’s ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery   the company’s review for impairment generally entails   identification and evaluation of investments that have indications of possible impairment analysis of individual investments that have fair values less than amortized cost including consideration of the length of time the investment has been in an unrealized loss position and the expected recovery period discussion of evidential matter including an evaluation of factors or triggers that could cause individual investments to qualify as having otherthantemporary impairment and those that would not support otherthantemporary impairment and documentation of the results of these analyses as required under business policies 

  for equity securities management considers the various factors described above including its intent and ability to hold the equity security for a period of time sufficient for recovery to cost or whether it is morelikelythannot that the company will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its cost basis where management lacks that intent or ability the security’s decline in fair value is deemed to be otherthantemporary and is recorded in earnings afs equity securities deemed otherthantemporarily impaired are written down to fair value with the full difference between fair value and cost recognized in earnings   management assesses equity method investments with fair value less than carrying value for otti fair value is measured as price multiplied by quantity if the investee has publicly listed securities if the investee is not publicly listed other methods are used see note 25 to the consolidated financial statements   for impaired equity method investments that citi plans to sell prior to recovery of value or would likely be required to sell and there is no expectation that the fair value will recover prior to the expected sale date the full impairment is recognized in the consolidated statement of income as otti regardless of severity and duration the measurement of the otti does not include partial projected recoveries subsequent to the balance sheet date   for impaired equity method investments that management does not plan to sell prior to recovery of value and is not likely to be required to sell the evaluation of whether an impairment is other than temporary is based on i whether and when an equity method investment will recover in value and ii whether the investor has the intent and ability to hold that investment for a period of time sufficient to recover the value the determination of whether the impairment is considered otherthantemporary is based on all of the following indicators regardless of the time and extent of impairment 

cause of the impairment and the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the issuer including any specific events that may influence the operations of the issuer intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the carrying value   at december 31 2011 citi had several equity method investments that had temporary impairment including its investments in akbank and the morgan stanley smith barney joint venture mssb each as discussed further below as of december 31 2011 management does not plan to sell those investments prior to recovery of value and it is not more likely than not that citi will be required to sell those investments prior to recovery in value   excluding the impact of foreign currency translation and related hedges the fair value of citi’s equity method investment in akbank had exceeded its carrying value during the fourth quarter of 2011 however the fair value of citi’s equity method investment in akbank declined resulting in a temporary impairment during 2012 to date akbank’s share price has recovered significantly and as of february 23 2012 the temporary impairment was approximately 02 billion as of 

december 31 2011 and february 23 2012 foreign currency translation and related hedges on this equity method investment totaled an additional cumulative pretax loss of approximately 09 billion   regarding citi’s equity method investment in mssb citi has evaluated this investment for otti based on the qualitative and quantitative measures discussed herein see also note 25 to the consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2011 citi’s carrying value of this equity method investment was approximately 10 billion based on the midpoint of the current range of estimated values analysis indicates that a temporary impairment may exist however based on this analysis the potential temporary impairment was not material for debt securities that are not deemed to be credit impaired management assesses whether it intends to sell or whether it is morelikelythannot that it would be required to sell the investment before the expected recovery of the amortized cost basis in most cases management has asserted that it has no intent to sell and that it believes it is not likely to be required to sell the investment before recovery of its amortized cost basis where such an assertion cannot be made the security’s decline in fair value is deemed to be other than temporary and is recorded in earnings   for debt securities a critical component of the evaluation for otti is the identification of credit impaired securities where management does not expect to receive cash flows sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security for securities purchased and classified as afs with the expectation of receiving full principal and interest cash flows as of the date of purchase this analysis considers the likelihood of receiving all contractual principal and interest for securities reclassified out of the trading category in the fourth quarter of 2008 the analysis considers the likelihood of receiving the expected principal and interest cash flows anticipated as of the date of reclassification in the fourth quarter of 2008 the extent of the company’s analysis regarding credit quality and the stress on assumptions used in the analysis have been refined for securities where the current fair value or other characteristics of the security warrant the paragraphs below describe the company’s process for identifying creditrelated impairments in security types with the most significant unrealized losses as of december 31 2011 

mortgagebacked securities for us mortgagebacked securities and in particular for alta and other mortgagebacked securities that have significant unrealized losses as a percentage of amortized cost credit impairment is assessed using a cash flow model that estimates the cash flows on the underlying mortgages using the securityspecific collateral and transaction structure the model estimates cash flows from the underlying mortgage loans and distributes those cash flows to various tranches of securities considering the transaction structure and any subordination and credit enhancements that exist in that structure the cash flow model incorporates actual cash flows on the mortgagebacked securities through the current period and then projects the remaining cash flows using a number of assumptions including default rates prepayment rates and recovery rates on foreclosed properties   management develops specific assumptions using as much market data as possible and includes internal estimates as well as estimates published 

by rating agencies and other thirdparty sources default rates are projected by considering current underlying mortgage loan performance generally assuming the default of 1 10 of current loans 2 25 of 30–59 day delinquent loans 3 70 of 60–90 day delinquent loans and 4 100 of 91 day delinquent loans these estimates are extrapolated along a default timing curve to estimate the total lifetime pool default rate other assumptions used contemplate the actual collateral attributes including geographic concentrations rating agency loss projections rating actions and current market prices   the key assumptions for mortgagebacked securities as of december 31 2011 are in the table below 

    the valuation as of december 31 2011 assumes that us housing prices will decrease 4 in 2012 decrease 1 in 2013 remain flat in 2014 and increase 3 per year from 2015 onwards while unemployment is 89 for 2012   in addition cash flow projections are developed using more stressful parameters management assesses the results of those stress tests including the severity of any cash shortfall indicated and the likelihood of the stress scenarios actually occurring based on the underlying pool’s characteristics and performance to assess whether management expects to recover the amortized cost basis of the security if cash flow projections indicate that the company does not expect to recover its amortized cost basis the company recognizes the estimated credit loss in earnings 

state and municipal securities citigroup’s afs state and municipal bonds consist mainly of bonds that are financed through tender option bond programs or were previously financed in this program the process for identifying credit impairments for these bonds is largely based on thirdparty credit ratings individual bond positions are required to meet minimum ratings requirements which vary based on the sector of the bond issuer   citigroup monitors the bond issuer and insurer ratings on a daily basis the average portfolio rating ignoring any insurance is aa3aa in the event of a downgrade of the bond below aa3aa the subject bond is specifically reviewed for potential shortfall in contractual principal and interest the remainder of citigroup’s afs and htm state and municipal bonds are specifically reviewed for credit impairment based on instrumentspecific estimates of cash flows probability of default and loss given default   for impaired afs state and municipal bonds that citi plans to sell or would likely be required to sell and there is no expectation that the fair value will recover prior to the expected sale date the full impairment is recognized in earnings 

recognition and measurement of otti the following table presents the total otti recognized in earnings for the year ended december 31 2011 

 the following is a 12 month rollforward of the creditrelated impairments recognized in earnings for afs and htm debt securities held as of december 31 2011 that the company does not intend to sell nor will likely be required to sell

investments in alternative investment funds that calculate net asset value per share the company holds investments in certain alternative investment funds that calculate net asset value nav per share including hedge funds private equity funds funds of funds and real estate funds the company’s investments include coinvestments in funds that are managed by the 

company and investments in funds that are managed by third parties investments in funds are generally classified as nonmarketable equity securities carried at fair value   the fair values of these investments are estimated using the nav per share of the company’s ownership interest in the funds where it is not probable that the company will sell an investment at a price other than nav 

    under the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 doddfrank act the company will be required to limit its investments in and arrangements with “private equity funds” and “hedge funds” as defined under the statute and impending regulations citi does not believe the implementation of the fund provisions of the doddfrank act will have a material negative impact on its overall results of operations

    during the year ended december 31 2011 the company sold andor reclassified to heldforsale 21 billion of consumer loans the company did not have significant purchases of consumer loans during the 12 months ended december 31 2011   citigroup has a comprehensive risk management process to monitor evaluate and manage the principal risks associated with its consumer loan portfolio included in the loan table above are lending products whose terms may give rise to additional credit issues credit cards with belowmarket introductory interest rates and interestonly loans are examples of such products however these products are closely managed using appropriate credit techniques that mitigate their additional inherent risk   credit quality indicators that are actively monitored include delinquency status consumer credit scores fico and loan to value ltv ratios each as discussed in more detail below 

delinquency status delinquency status is carefully monitored and considered a key indicator of credit quality substantially all of the us residential first mortgage loans use the mba method of reporting delinquencies which considers a loan delinquent if a monthly payment has not been received by the end of the day immediately preceding the loan’s next due date all other loans use the ots method of reporting delinquencies which considers a loan delinquent if a monthly payment has not been received by the close of business on the loan’s next due date as a general rule residential first mortgages home equity loans and installment loans are classified as nonaccrual when loan payments are 90 days contractually past due credit cards and unsecured revolving loans generally accrue interest until payments are 180 days past due commercial market loans are placed on a cash nonaccrual basis when it is determined based on actual experience and a forwardlooking assessment of the collectability of the loan in full that the payment of interest or principal is doubtful or when interest or principal is 90 days past due   the policy for reaging modified us consumer loans to current status varies by product generally one of the conditions to qualify for these modifications is that a minimum number of payments typically ranging from one to three be made upon modification the loan is reaged to current status however reaging practices for certain openended consumer loans such as credit cards are governed by federal financial institutions examination council ffiec guidelines for openended consumer loans subject to ffiec guidelines one of the conditions for the loan to be reaged to current status is that at least three consecutive minimum monthly payments or the equivalent amount must be received in addition under ffiec guidelines the number of times that such a loan can be reaged is subject to limitations generally once in 12 months and twice in five years furthermore federal housing administration fha and department of veterans affairs va loans are modified under those respective agencies’ guidelines and payments are not always required in order to reage a modified loan to current

consumer credit scores fico in the us independent credit agencies rate an individual’s risk for assuming debt based on the individual’s credit history and assign every consumer a credit score these scores are often called “fico scores” because most credit bureau scores used in the us are produced from software developed by fair isaac corporation scores range from a high of 900 which indicates high credit quality to 300 these scores are continually updated by the agencies based upon an individual’s credit actions eg taking out a loan or missed or late payments   the following table provides details on the fico scores attributable to citi’s us consumer loan portfolio as of december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 commercial market loans are not included in the table since they are businessbased and fico scores are not a primary driver in their credit evaluation fico scores are updated monthly for substantially all of the portfolio or otherwise on a quarterly basis   during the first quarter of 2011 the cards businesses citibranded and retail partner cards in the us began using a more updated fico model version to score customer accounts for substantially all of their loans the change was made to incorporate a more recent version of fico in order to improve the predictive strength of the score and to enhance citi’s ability to manage risk in the first quarter this change resulted in an increase in the percentage of balances with fico scores equal to or greater than 660 and conversely lowered the percentage of balances with fico scores lower than 620 

  

  loan to value ratios ltv loan to value ltv ratios loan balance divided by appraised value are calculated at origination and updated by applying market price data   the following tables provide details on the ltv ratios attributable to citi’s us consumer mortgage portfolios as of december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 ltv ratios are updated monthly using the most recent core logic hpi data available for substantially all of the portfolio applied at the metropolitan statistical area level if available otherwise at the state level the remainder of the portfolio is updated in a similar manner using the office of federal housing enterprise oversight indices 

   

impaired consumer loans impaired loans are those for which citigroup believes it is probable that it will not collect all amounts due according to the original contractual terms of the loan impaired consumer loans include nonaccrual commercial market loans as well as smallerbalance homogeneous loans whose terms have been modified due to the borrower’s financial difficulties and citigroup has granted a concession to the borrower these modifications may include interest rate reductions andor principal forgiveness impaired consumer loans exclude smallerbalance homogeneous loans that have not been modified and are carried on a nonaccrual basis in addition impaired consumer loans exclude substantially all loans modified pursuant to citi’s shortterm modification programs ie for periods of 12 months or less that were modified prior to january 1 2011 at december 31 2011 loans included in these shortterm programs amounted to approximately 3 billion 

effective in the third quarter of 2011 as a result of adopting asu 201102 certain loans modified under shortterm programs since january 1 2011 that were previously measured for impairment under asc 450 are now measured for impairment under asc 3101035 at the end of the first interim period of adoption september 30 2011 the recorded investment in receivables previously measured under asc 450 was 1170 million and the allowance for credit losses associated with those loans was 467 million see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of this change

    citigroup has established a risk management process to monitor evaluate and manage the principal risks associated with its corporate loan portfolio as part of its risk management process citi assigns numeric risk ratings to its corporate loan facilities based on quantitative and qualitative assessments of the obligor and facility these risk ratings are reviewed at least annually or more often if material events related to the obligor or facility warrant factors considered in assigning the risk ratings include financial condition of the obligor qualitative assessment of management and strategy amount and sources of repayment amount and type of collateral and guarantee arrangements amount and type of any contingencies associated with the obligor and the obligor’s industry and geography 

  the obligor risk ratings are defined by ranges of default probabilities the facility risk ratings are defined by ranges of loss norms which are the product of the probability of default and the loss given default the investment grade rating categories are similar to the category bbbbaa3 and above as defined by sp and moody’s loans classified according to the bank regulatory definitions as special mention substandard and doubtful will have risk ratings within the noninvestment grade categories

purchased distressed loans included in the corporate and consumer loan outstanding tables above are purchased distressed loans which are loans that have evidenced significant credit deterioration subsequent to origination but prior to acquisition by citigroup in accordance with sop 033 codified as asc 31030 the difference between the total expected cash flows for these loans and the initial recorded investment is recognized in income over the life of the loans using a level yield accordingly these loans have been excluded from the impaired loan table information presented above in addition per sop 033 subsequent decreases in the expected cash flows for a purchased distressed loan require a build of an allowance so the loan retains its level yield however increases in the expected cash flows are first recognized as a reduction of any previously established allowance and then recognized as income prospectively over the remaining life of the loan by increasing the loan’s level yield where the expected cash flows cannot be reliably estimated the purchased distressed loan is accounted for under the cost recovery method 

  the carrying amount of the company’s purchased distressed loan portfolio at december 31 2011 was 443 million net of an allowance of 68 million as of december 31 2011

18 goodwill and intangible assets 

goodwill the changes in goodwill during 2011 and 2010 were as follows 

 the changes in goodwill by segment during 2011 and 2010 were as follows 

    goodwill impairment testing is performed at a level below the business segments referred to as a reporting unit the reporting unit structure in 2011 is consistent with those reporting units identified in the second quarter of 2009 as a result of the change in organizational structure during 2011 goodwill was allocated to disposals and tested for impairment for each of the reporting units the company performed goodwill impairment testing for all reporting units as of july 1 2011 no goodwill was written off due to impairment in 2009 2010 and 2011 

  the following table shows reporting units with goodwill balances as of december 31 2011 and the excess of fair value as a percentage over allocated book value as of the annual impairment test 

    citigroup engaged the services of an independent valuation specialist to assist in the valuation of the reporting units at july 1 2011 using a combination of the market approach andor income approach consistent with the valuation model used in the past   under the market approach for valuing each reporting unit the key assumption is the selected price multiples the selection of the multiples considers the operating performance and financial condition of the reporting unit operations as compared with those of a group of selected publicly traded guideline companies and a group of selected acquired companies among other factors the level and expected growth in return on tangible equity relative to those of the guideline companies and guideline transactions is considered since the guideline company prices used are on a minority interest basis the selection of the multiple considers the recent acquisition prices which reflect control rights and privileges in arriving at a multiple that reflects an appropriate control premium   for the valuation under the income approach the assumptions used as the basis for the model include cash flows for the forecasted period the assumptions embedded in arriving at an estimation of the terminal value and the discount rate the cash flows for the forecasted period are estimated based on management’s most recent projections available as of the testing date giving consideration to targeted equity capital requirements based on selected public guideline companies for the reporting unit in arriving at the terminal value for each reporting unit using 2014 as the terminal year the assumptions used include a longterm growth rate and a pricetotangible book multiple based on selected public guideline companies for the reporting unit the discount rate is based on the reporting unit’s estimated cost of equity capital computed under the capital asset pricing model 

  embedded in the key assumptions underlying the valuation model described above is the inherent uncertainty regarding the possibility that economic conditions that affect credit risk and behavior may vary or other events will occur that will impact the business model deterioration in the assumptions used in the valuations in particular the discountrate and growthrate assumptions used in the net income projections could affect citigroup’s impairment evaluation and hence the company’s net income while there is inherent uncertainty embedded in the assumptions used in developing management’s forecasts the assumptions used reflect management’s best estimates as of the testing date   if the future were to differ adversely from management’s best estimate of key economic assumptions and associated cash flows were to significantly decrease citi could potentially experience future impairment charges with respect to goodwill any such charges by themselves would not negatively affect citi’s tier 1 and total capital regulatory ratios tier 1 common ratio its tangible common equity or citi’s liquidity position 

intangible assets the components of intangible assets were as follows 

    intangible assets amortization expense was 898 million 976 million and 1179 million for 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively intangible assets amortization expense is estimated to be 826 million in 2012 822 million in 2013 734 million in 2014 700 million in 2015 and 807 million in 2016 

the changes in intangible assets during 2011 were as follows

19 debt 

shortterm borrowings shortterm borrowings consist of commercial paper and other borrowings with weighted average interest rates at december 31 as follows 

    borrowings under bank lines of credit may be at interest rates based on libor cd rates the prime rate or bids submitted by the banks citigroup pays commitment fees for its lines of credit   some of citigroup’s nonbank subsidiaries have credit facilities with citigroup’s subsidiary depository institutions including citibank na borrowings under these facilities must be secured in accordance with section 23a of the federal reserve act   citigroup global markets holdings inc cgmhi has substantial borrowing agreements consisting of facilities that cgmhi has been advised are available but where no contractual lending obligation exists these arrangements are reviewed on an ongoing basis to ensure flexibility in meeting cgmhi’s shortterm requirements 

longterm debt 

 

  cgmhi has committed longterm financing facilities with unaffiliated banks at december 31 2011 cgmhi had drawn down the full 700 million available under these facilities of which 150 million is guaranteed by citigroup generally a bank can terminate these facilities by giving cgmhi oneyear prior notice   the company issues both fixed and variable rate debt in a range of currencies it uses derivative contracts primarily interest rate swaps to effectively convert a portion of its fixed rate debt to variable rate debt and 

variable rate debt to fixed rate debt the maturity structure of the derivatives generally corresponds to the maturity structure of the debt being hedged in addition the company uses other derivative contracts to manage the foreign exchange impact of certain debt issuances at december 31 2011 the company’s overall weighted average interest rate for longterm debt was 362 on a contractual basis and 329 including the effects of derivative contracts 

aggregate annual maturities of longterm debt obligations based on final maturity dates including trust preferred securities are as follows 

   longterm debt includes junior subordinated debt with a balance sheet carrying value of 16057 million and 18131 million at december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 respectively the company formed statutory business trusts under the laws of the state of delaware the trusts exist for the exclusive purposes of i issuing trust securities representing undivided beneficial interests in the assets of the trust ii investing the gross proceeds of the trust securities in junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures subordinated debentures of its parent and iii engaging in only those activities necessary or incidental thereto upon approval from the federal reserve board citigroup has the right to redeem these securities 

the following table summarizes the financial structure of each of the company’s subsidiary trusts at december 31 2011 

    in each case the coupon rate on the debentures is the same as that on the trust securities distributions on the trust securities and interest on the debentures are payable quarterly except for citigroup capital iii citigroup capital xviii and citigroup capital xxi on which distributions are payable semiannually 

  in connection with the fourth and final remarketing of trust securities held by adia during the second quarter of 2011 citigroup exchanged the junior subordinated debentures owned by citigroup capital trust xxxii for 1875 billion of senior notes with a coupon of 3953 payable semiannually the senior notes mature on june 15 2016 

20 regulatory capital 

citigroup is subject to riskbased capital and leverage guidelines issued by the board of governors of the federal reserve system frb its us insured depository institution subsidiaries including citibank na are subject to similar guidelines issued by their respective primary federal bank regulatory agencies these guidelines are used to evaluate capital adequacy and include the required minimums shown in the following table   the regulatory agencies are required by law to take specific prompt actions with respect to institutions that do not meet minimum capital standards as of december 31 2011 and 2010 all of citigroup’s us insured subsidiary depository institutions were “well capitalized”   at december 31 2011 regulatory capital as set forth in guidelines issued by the us federal bank regulators is as follows 

  

banking subsidiaries–constraints on dividends there are various legal limitations on the ability of citigroup’s subsidiary depository institutions to extend credit pay dividends or otherwise supply funds to citigroup and its nonbank subsidiaries the approval of the office of the comptroller of the currency is required if total dividends declared in any calendar year exceed amounts specified by the applicable agency’s regulations statechartered depository institutions are subject to dividend limitations imposed by applicable state law   in determining the dividends each depository institution must also consider its effect on applicable riskbased capital and leverage ratio requirements as well as policy statements of the federal regulatory agencies that indicate that banking organizations should generally pay dividends out of current operating earnings citigroup received 109 billion in dividends from citibank na in 2011 

nonbanking subsidiaries citigroup also receives dividends from its nonbank subsidiaries these nonbank subsidiaries are generally not subject to regulatory restrictions on dividends   the ability of cgmhi to declare dividends can be restricted by capital considerations of its brokerdealer subsidiaries

22 securitizations and variable interest entities 

uses of spes a special purpose entity spe is an entity designed to fulfill a specific limited need of the company that organized it the principal uses of spes are to obtain liquidity and favorable capital treatment by securitizing certain of citigroup’s financial assets to assist clients in securitizing their financial assets and to create investment products for clients spes may be organized in many legal forms including trusts partnerships or corporations in a securitization the company transferring assets to an spe converts all or a portion of those assets into cash before they would have been realized in the normal course of business through the spe’s issuance of debt and equity instruments certificates commercial paper and other notes of indebtedness which are recorded on the balance sheet of the spe and not reflected in the transferring company’s balance sheet assuming applicable accounting requirements are satisfied   investors usually have recourse to the assets in the spe and often benefit from other credit enhancements such as a collateral account or overcollateralization in the form of excess assets in the spe a line of credit or from a liquidity facility such as a liquidity put option or asset purchase agreement the spe can typically obtain a more favorable credit rating from rating agencies than the transferor could obtain for its own debt issuances resulting in less expensive financing costs than unsecured debt the spe may also enter into derivative contracts in order to convert the yield or currency of the underlying assets to match the needs of the spe investors or to limit or change the credit risk of the spe citigroup may be the provider of certain credit enhancements as well as the counterparty to any related derivative contracts   most of citigroup’s spes are now vies as described below 

variable interest entities vies are entities that have either a total equity investment that is insufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or whose equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest ie ability to make significant decisions through voting rights and right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity or obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity investors that finance the vie through debt or equity interests or other counterparties that provide other forms of support such as guarantees subordinated fee arrangements or certain types of derivative contracts are variable interest holders in the entity   the variable interest holder if any that has a controlling financial interest in a vie is deemed to be the primary beneficiary and must consolidate the vie citigroup would be deemed to have a controlling financial interest and be the primary beneficiary if it has both of the following characteristics 

power to direct activities of a vie that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie or right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie   the company must evaluate its involvement in each vie and understand the purpose and design of the entity the role the company had in the entity’s design and its involvement in the vie’s ongoing activities the company then must evaluate which activities most significantly impact the economic performance of the vie and who has the power to direct such activities   for those vies where the company determines that it has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the vie’s economic performance the company then must evaluate its economic interests if any and determine whether it could absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the vie when evaluating whether the company has an obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant it considers the maximum exposure to such loss without consideration of probability such obligations could be in various forms including but not limited to debt and equity investments guarantees liquidity agreements and certain derivative contracts   in various other transactions the company may act as a derivative counterparty for example interest rate swap crosscurrency swap or purchaser of credit protection under a credit default swap or total return swap where the company pays the total return on certain assets to the spe may act as underwriter or placement agent may provide administrative trustee or other services or may make a market in debt securities or other instruments issued by vies the company generally considers such involvement by itself not to be variable interests and thus not an indicator of power or potentially significant benefits or losses 

  citigroup’s involvement with consolidated and unconsolidated vies with which the company holds significant variable interests or has continuing involvement through servicing a majority of the assets in a vie as of december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 is presented below

the previous tables do not include 

certain venture capital investments made by some of the company’s private equity subsidiaries as the company accounts for these investments in accordance with the investment company audit guide certain limited partnerships that are investment funds that qualify for the deferral from the requirements of asc 810 where the company is the general partner and the limited partners have the right to replace the general partner or liquidate the funds certain investment funds for which the company provides investment management services and personal estate trusts for which the company provides administrative trustee andor investment management services vies structured by third parties where the company holds securities in inventory these investments are made on arm’slength terms certain positions in mortgagebacked and assetbacked securities held by the company which are classified as trading account assets or investments  where the company has no other involvement with the related securitization entity deemed to be significant for more information on these positions see notes 14 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements certain representations and warranties exposures in legacy securities and banking mortgagebacked and assetbacked securitizations where the company has no variable interest or continuing involvement as servicer the outstanding balance of the loans securitized was approximately 22 billion at december 31 2011 related to legacy transactions sponsored by securities and banking during the period 2005 to 2008 and certain representations and warranties exposures in consumer mortgage securitizations where the original mortgage loan balances are no longer outstanding 

  the asset balances for consolidated vies represent the carrying amounts of the assets consolidated by the company the carrying amount may represent the amortized cost or the current fair value of the assets depending on the legal form of the asset eg security or loan and the company’s standard accounting policies for the asset type and line of business   the asset balances for unconsolidated vies where the company has significant involvement represent the most current information available to the company in most cases the asset balances represent an amortized cost basis without regard to impairments in fair value unless fair value information is readily available to the company for vies that obtain asset exposures synthetically through derivative instruments for example synthetic cdos the tables generally include the full original notional amount of the derivative as an asset   the maximum funded exposure represents the balance sheet carrying amount of the company’s investment in the vie it reflects the initial amount of cash invested in the vie plus any accrued interest and is adjusted for any impairments in value recognized in earnings and any cash principal payments received the maximum exposure of unfunded positions represents the remaining undrawn committed amount including liquidity and credit facilities provided by the company or the notional amount of a derivative instrument considered to be a variable interest adjusted for any declines in fair value recognized in earnings in certain transactions the company has entered into derivative instruments or other arrangements that are not considered variable interests in the vie eg interest rate swaps crosscurrency swaps or where the company is the purchaser of credit protection under a credit default swap or total return swap where the company pays the total return on certain assets to the spe receivables under such arrangements are not included in the maximum exposure amounts 

funding commitments for significant unconsolidated vies—liquidity facilities and loan commitments the following table presents the notional amount of liquidity facilities and loan commitments that are classified as funding commitments in the vie tables above as of december 31 2011 

 citicorp and citi holdings consolidated vies the company engages in onbalancesheet securitizations which are securitizations that do not qualify for sales treatment thus the assets remain on the company’s balance sheet the consolidated vies included in the tables below represent hundreds of separate entities with which the company is involved in general the thirdparty investors in the obligations of consolidated vies have legal recourse only to the assets of the vies and do not have such recourse to the company except where the company has provided a guarantee to the investors or is the counterparty to certain derivative transactions involving the vie in addition the assets are generally restricted only to pay such liabilities 

  thus the company’s maximum legal exposure to loss related to consolidated vies is significantly less than the carrying value of the consolidated vie assets due to outstanding thirdparty financing intercompany assets and liabilities are excluded from the table all assets are restricted from being sold or pledged as collateral the cash flows from these assets are the only source used to pay down the associated liabilities which are nonrecourse to the company’s general assets   the following table presents the carrying amounts and classifications of consolidated assets that are collateral for consolidated vie and spe obligations

 credit card securitizations 

the company securitizes credit card receivables through trusts that are established to purchase the receivables citigroup transfers receivables into the trusts on a nonrecourse basis credit card securitizations are revolving securitizations that is as customers pay their credit card balances the cash proceeds are used to purchase new receivables and replenish the receivables in the trust since the adoption of sfas 167 on january 1 2010 the trusts are treated as consolidated entities because as servicer citigroup has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the trusts and also holds a seller’s interest and certain securities issued by the trusts and provides liquidity 

facilities to the trusts which could result in potentially significant losses or benefits from the trusts accordingly the transferred credit card receivables are required to remain on the consolidated balance sheet with no gain or loss recognized the debt issued by the trusts to third parties is included in the consolidated balance sheet   the company relies on securitizations to fund a significant portion of its credit card businesses in north america  the following table reflects amounts related to the company’s securitized credit card receivables

 managed loans after securitization of credit card receivables the company continues to maintain credit card customer account relationships and provides servicing for receivables transferred to the trusts as a result the company considers the securitized credit card receivables to be part of the business it manages as citigroup consolidates the credit card trusts all managed securitized card receivables are onbalance sheet 

funding liquidity facilities and subordinated interests citigroup securitizes credit card receivables through two securitization trusts—citibank credit card master trust master trust which is part of citicorp and the citibank omni master trust omni trust which is part of citi holdings as of december 31 2011 the liabilities of the trusts are included in the consolidated balance sheet excluding those retained by citigroup   master trust issues fixed and floatingrate term notes some of the term notes are issued to multiseller commercial paper conduits the weighted average maturity of the term notes issued by the master trust was 31 years as of december 31 2011 and 34 years as of december 31 2010 

master trust liabilities at par value 

   the omni trust issues fixed and floatingrate term notes some of which are purchased by multiseller commercial paper conduits   the weighted average maturity of the thirdparty term notes issued by the omni trust was 15 years as of december 31 2011 and 18 years as of december 31 2010 

omni trust liabilities at par value 

 mortgage securitizations the company provides a wide range of mortgage loan products to a diverse customer base   once originated the company often securitizes these loans through the use of spes these spes are funded through the issuance of trust certificates backed solely by the transferred assets these certificates have the same average life as the transferred assets in addition to providing a source of liquidity and less expensive funding securitizing these assets also reduces the company’s credit exposure to the borrowers these mortgage loan securitizations are primarily nonrecourse thereby effectively transferring the risk of future credit losses to the purchasers of the securities issued by the trust however the company’s consumer business generally retains the servicing rights and in certain instances retains investment securities interestonly strips and residual interests in future cash flows from the trusts and also provides servicing for a limited number of securities and banking securitizations securities and banking and special asset pool do not retain servicing for their mortgage securitizations 

  the company securitizes mortgage loans generally through either a governmentsponsored agency such as ginnie mae fnma or freddie mac us agencysponsored mortgages or private label nonagencysponsored mortgages securitization the company is not the primary beneficiary of its us agencysponsored mortgage securitizations because citigroup does not have the power to direct the activities of the spe that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance therefore citi does not consolidate these us agencysponsored mortgage securitizations 

  the company does not consolidate certain nonagencysponsored mortgage securitizations because citi is either not the servicer with the power to direct the significant activities of the entity or citi is the servicer but the servicing relationship is deemed to be a fiduciary relationship and therefore citi is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the entity   in certain instances the company has 1 the power to direct the activities and 2 the obligation to either absorb losses or right to receive benefits that could be potentially significant to its nonagencysponsored mortgage securitizations and therefore is the primary beneficiary and consolidates the spe 

mortgage securitizations—citicorp the following tables summarize selected cash flow information related to mortgage securitizations for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 

   gains losses recognized on the securitization of us agencysponsored mortgages during 2011 were 8 million for the year ended december 31 2011 gains losses recognized on the securitization of nonagencysponsored mortgages were 1 million 

  agency and nonagency mortgage securitization gains losses for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 were 5 million and 18 million respectively 

  key assumptions used in measuring the fair value of retained interests at the date of sale or securitization of mortgage receivables for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 are as follows

mortgage servicing rights in connection with the securitization of mortgage loans the company’s us consumer mortgage business retains the servicing rights which entitle the company to a future stream of cash flows based on the outstanding principal balances of the loans and the contractual servicing fee failure to service the loans in accordance with contractual requirements may lead to a termination of the servicing rights and the loss of future servicing fees 

  the fair value of capitalized mortgage servicing rights msrs was 26 billion and 46 billion at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively the msrs correspond to principal loan balances of 401 billion and 455 billion as of december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively the following table summarizes the changes in capitalized msrs for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 

 

  the market for msrs is not sufficiently liquid to provide participants with quoted market prices therefore the company uses an optionadjusted spread valuation approach to determine the fair value of msrs this approach consists of projecting servicing cash flows under multiple interest rate scenarios and discounting these cash flows using riskadjusted discount rates the key assumptions used in the valuation of msrs include mortgage prepayment speeds and discount rates the model assumptions and the msrs’ fair value estimates are compared to observable trades of similar msr portfolios and interestonly security portfolios as available as well as to msr broker valuations and industry surveys the cash flow model and underlying prepayment and interest rate models used to value these msrs are subject to validation in accordance with the company’s model validation policies   the fair value of the msrs is primarily affected by changes in prepayments that result from shifts in mortgage interest rates in managing this risk the company economically hedges a significant portion of the value of its msrs through the use of interest rate derivative contracts forward purchase commitments of mortgagebacked securities and purchased securities classified as trading   the company receives fees during the course of servicing previously securitized mortgages the amounts of these fees for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 were as follows 

   these fees are classified in the consolidated statement of income as other revenue  

resecuritizations the company engages in resecuritization transactions in which debt securities are transferred to a vie in exchange for new beneficial interests during the 12 months ended december 31 2011 citi transferred nonagency private label securities with an original par value of approximately 303 million to resecuritization entities these securities are backed by either residential or commercial mortgages and are often structured on behalf of clients as of december 31 2011 the fair value of citiretained interests in privatelabel resecuritization transactions structured by citi totaled approximately 340 million 39 million of which relates to resecuritization transactions executed in 2011 and are recorded in trading assets of this amount approximately 17 million and 323 million related to senior and subordinated beneficial interests respectively the original par value of private label resecuritization transactions in which citi holds a retained interest as of december 31 2011 was approximately 72 billion   the company also resecuritizes us governmentagency guaranteed mortgagebacked agency securities during the 12 months ended december 31 2011 citi transferred agency securities with a fair value of approximately 377 billion to resecuritization entities as of december 31 2011 the fair value of citiretained interests in agency resecuritization transactions structured by citi totaled approximately 23 billion 21 billion of which related to resecuritization transactions executed in 2011 and are recorded in trading assets the original fair value of agency resecuritization transactions in which citi holds a retained interest as of december 31 2011 was approximately 506 billion   as of december 31 2011 the company did not consolidate any privatelabel or agency resecuritization entities 

citiadministered assetbacked commercial paper conduits the company is active in the assetbacked commercial paper conduit business as administrator of several multiseller commercial paper conduits and also as a service provider to singleseller and other commercial paper conduits sponsored by third parties   citi’s multiseller commercial paper conduits are designed to provide the company’s clients access to lowcost funding in the commercial paper markets the conduits purchase assets from or provide financing facilities to clients and are funded by issuing commercial paper to thirdparty investors the conduits generally do not purchase assets originated by the company the funding of the conduits is facilitated by the liquidity support and credit enhancements provided by the company   as administrator to citi’s conduits the company is generally responsible for selecting and structuring assets purchased or financed by the conduits making decisions regarding the funding of the conduits including determining the tenor and other features of the commercial paper issued monitoring the quality and performance of the conduits’ assets and facilitating the operations and cash flows of the conduits in return the company earns structuring fees from customers for individual transactions and earns an administration fee from the conduit which is equal to the income from the client program and liquidity fees of the conduit after payment of conduit expenses this administration fee is fairly stable since most risks and rewards of the underlying assets are passed back to the clients and once the asset pricing is negotiated most ongoing income costs and fees are relatively stable as a percentage of the conduit’s size   the conduits administered by the company do not generally invest in liquid securities that are formally rated by third parties the assets are privately negotiated and structured transactions that are designed to be held by the conduit rather than actively traded and sold the yield earned by the conduit on each asset is generally tied to the rate on the commercial paper issued by the conduit thus passing interest rate risk to the client each asset purchased by the conduit is structured with transactionspecific credit enhancement features provided by the thirdparty client seller including over collateralization cash and excess spread collateral accounts direct recourse or thirdparty guarantees these credit enhancements are sized with the objective of approximating a credit rating of a or above based on the company’s internal risk ratings 

  substantially all of the funding of the conduits is in the form of shortterm commercial paper with a weighted average life generally ranging from 25 to 60 days as of december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 the weighted average lives of the commercial paper issued by consolidated and unconsolidated conduits were approximately 37 and 41 days respectively at each period end   the primary credit enhancement provided to the conduit investors is in the form of transactionspecific credit enhancement described above in addition each consolidated conduit has obtained a letter of credit from the company which needs to be sized to be at least 8–10 of the conduit’s assets with a floor of 200 million the letters of credit provided by the company to the consolidated conduits total approximately 20 billion the net result across all multiseller conduits administered by the company is that in the event defaulted assets exceed the transactionspecific credit enhancements described above any losses in each conduit are allocated first to the company and then the commercial paper investors   the company also provides the conduits with two forms of liquidity agreements that are used to provide funding to the conduits in the event of a market disruption among other events each asset of the conduits is supported by a transactionspecific liquidity facility in the form of an asset purchase agreement apa under the apa the company has generally agreed to purchase nondefaulted eligible receivables from the conduit at par the apa is not generally designed to provide credit support to the conduit as it generally does not permit the purchase of defaulted or impaired assets any funding under the apa will likely subject the underlying borrower to the conduits to increased interest costs in addition the company provides the conduits with programwide liquidity in the form of shortterm lending commitments under these commitments the company has agreed to lend to the conduits in the event of a shortterm disruption in the commercial paper market subject to specified conditions the company receives fees for providing both types of liquidity agreements and considers these fees to be on fair market terms 

  finally the company is one of several named dealers in the commercial paper issued by the conduits and earns a marketbased fee for providing such services along with thirdparty dealers the company makes a market in the commercial paper and may from time to time fund commercial paper pending sale to a third party on specific dates with less liquidity in the market the company may hold in inventory commercial paper issued by conduits administered by the company as well as conduits administered by third parties the amount of commercial paper issued by its administered conduits held in inventory fluctuates based on market conditions and activity as of december 31 2011 the company owned 144 million of the commercial paper issued by its unconsolidated administered conduit   with the exception of the governmentguaranteed loan conduit described below the assetbacked commercial paper conduits are consolidated by the company the company determined that through its role as administrator it had the power to direct the activities that most significantly impacted the entities’ economic performance these powers included its ability to structure and approve the assets purchased by the conduits its ongoing surveillance and credit mitigation activities and its liability management in addition as a result of all the company’s involvement described above it was concluded that the company had an economic interest that could potentially be significant however the assets and liabilities of the conduits are separate and apart from those of citigroup no assets of any conduit are available to satisfy the creditors of citigroup or any of its other subsidiaries   the company administers one conduit that originates loans to thirdparty borrowers and those obligations are fully guaranteed primarily by aaarated government agencies that support export and development financing programs the economic performance of this governmentguaranteed loan conduit is most significantly impacted by the performance of its underlying assets the guarantors must approve each loan held by the entity and the guarantors have the ability through establishment of the servicing terms to direct default mitigation and to purchase defaulted loans to manage the conduit’s loans that become delinquent to improve the economic performance of the conduit because the company does not have the power to direct the activities of this governmentguaranteed loan conduit that most significantly impact the economic performance of the entity it was concluded that the company should not consolidate the entity the total notional exposure under the programwide liquidity agreement for the company’s unconsolidated administered conduit as of december 31 2011 is 06 billion the programwide liquidity agreement along with each asset apa is considered in the company’s maximum exposure to loss to the unconsolidated administered conduit   as of december 31 2011 this unconsolidated governmentguaranteed loan conduit held assets of approximately 130 billion 

thirdparty commercial paper conduits the company also provides liquidity facilities to single and multiseller conduits sponsored by third parties these conduits are independently owned and managed and invest in a variety of asset classes depending on the nature of the conduit the facilities provided by the company typically represent a small portion of the total liquidity facilities obtained by each conduit and are collateralized by the assets of each conduit as of december 31 2011 the notional amount of these facilities was approximately 746 million of which 448 million was funded under these facilities the company is not the party that has the power to direct the activities of these conduits that most significantly impact their economic performance and thus does not consolidate them 

collateralized debt and loan obligations a securitized collateralized debt obligation cdo is an spe that purchases a pool of assets consisting of assetbacked securities and synthetic exposures through derivatives on assetbacked securities and issues multiple tranches of equity and notes to investors   a cash cdo or arbitrage cdo is a cdo designed to take advantage of the difference between the yield on a portfolio of selected assets typically residential mortgagebacked securities and the cost of funding the cdo through the sale of notes to investors “cash flow” cdos are entities in which the cdo passes on cash flows from a pool of assets while “market value” cdos pay to investors the market value of the pool of assets owned by the cdo at maturity in these transactions all of the equity and notes issued by the cdo are funded as the cash is needed to purchase the debt securities   a synthetic cdo is similar to a cash cdo except that the cdo obtains exposure to all or a portion of the referenced assets synthetically through derivative instruments such as credit default swaps because the cdo does not need to raise cash sufficient to purchase the entire referenced portfolio a substantial portion of the senior tranches of risk is typically passed on to cdo investors in the form of unfunded liabilities or derivative instruments thus the cdo writes credit protection on select referenced debt securities to the company or third parties and the risk is then passed on to the cdo investors in the form of funded notes or purchased credit protection through derivative instruments any cash raised from investors is invested in a portfolio of collateral securities or investment contracts the collateral is then used to support the obligations of the cdo on the credit default swaps written to counterparties   a securitized collateralized loan obligation clo is substantially similar to the cdo transactions described above except that the assets owned by the spe either cash instruments or synthetic exposures through derivative instruments are corporate loans and to a lesser extent corporate bonds rather than assetbacked debt securities 

  a thirdparty asset manager is typically retained by the cdoclo to select the pool of assets and manage those assets over the term of the spe the company is the manager for a limited number of clo transactions   the company earns fees for warehousing assets prior to the creation of a “cash flow” or “market value” cdoclo structuring cdosclos and placing debt securities with investors in addition the company has retained interests in many of the cdosclos it has structured and makes a market in the issued notes   the company’s continuing involvement in synthetic cdosclos generally includes purchasing credit protection through credit default swaps with the cdoclo owning a portion of the capital structure of the cdoclo in the form of both unfunded derivative positions primarily supersenior exposures discussed below and funded notes entering into interestrate swap and totalreturn swap transactions with the cdoclo lending to the cdoclo and making a market in the funded notes   where a cdoclo entity issues preferred shares or subordinated notes that are the equivalent form the preferred shares generally represent an insufficient amount of equity less than 10 and create the presumption that preferred shares are insufficient to finance the entity’s activities without subordinated financial support in addition although the preferred shareholders generally have full exposure to expected losses on the collateral and uncapped potential to receive expected residual returns they generally do not have the ability to make decisions about the entity that have a significant effect on the entity’s financial results because of their limited role in making daytoday decisions and their limited ability to remove the asset manager because one or both of the above conditions will generally be met the company has concluded that even where a cdoclo entity issued preferred shares the entity should be classified as a vie   in general the asset manager through its ability to purchase and sell assets or—where the reinvestment period of a cdoclo has expired—the ability to sell assets will have the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the economic performance of the cdo clo however where a cdoclo has experienced an event of default or an optional redemption period has gone into effect the activities of the asset manager may be curtailed andor certain additional rights will generally be provided to the investors in a cdoclo entity including the right to direct the liquidation of the cdoclo entity   the company has retained significant portions of the “supersenior” positions issued by certain cdos these positions are referred to as “supersenior” because they represent the most senior positions in the cdo and at the time of structuring were senior to tranches rated aaa by independent rating agencies the positions have included facilities structured in the form of shortterm commercial paper where the company wrote put options “liquidity puts” to certain cdos under the terms of the liquidity puts if the cdo was unable to issue commercial paper at a rate below a specified maximum generally libor  35 bps to libor  40 bps the company was obligated to fund the senior tranche of the cdo at a specified interest rate as of december 31 2011 the company no longer had exposure to this commercial paper as all of the underlying cdos had been liquidated 

the company does not generally have the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impacts the economic performance of the cdosclos as this power is generally held by a thirdparty asset manager of the cdoclo as such those cdosclos are not consolidated the company may consolidate the cdoclo when i the company is the asset manager and no other single investor has the unilateral ability to remove the company or unilaterally cause the liquidation of the cdoclo or the company is not the asset manager but has a unilateral right to remove the thirdparty asset manager or unilaterally liquidate the cdoclo and receive the underlying assets and ii the company has economic exposure to the entity that could be potentially significant to the entity   the company continues to monitor its involvement in unconsolidated cdosclos to assess future consolidation risk for example if the company were to acquire additional interests in these entities and obtain the right due to an event of default trigger being met to unilaterally liquidate or direct the activities of a cdoclo the company may be required to consolidate the asset entity for cash cdosclos the net result of such consolidation would be to gross up the company’s balance sheet by the current fair value of the securities held by third parties and assets held by the cdoclo which amounts are not considered material for synthetic cdosclos the net result of such consolidation may reduce the company’s balance sheet because intercompany derivative receivables and payables would be eliminated in consolidation and other assets held by the cdoclo and the securities held by third parties would be recognized at their current fair values 

key assumptions and retained interests—citi holdings the key assumptions used for the securitization of cdos and clos during the year ended december 31 2011 in measuring the fair value of retained interests at the date of sale or securitization are as follows 

   the effect of two negative changes in discount rates used to determine the fair value of retained interests is disclosed below 

   the cash flows received on retained interests and other net cash flows from citi’s clos for the year ended december 31 2011 were 93 million 

assetbased financing the company provides loans and other forms of financing to vies that hold assets those loans are subject to the same credit approvals as all other loans originated or purchased by the company financings in the form of debt securities or derivatives are in most circumstances reported in trading account assets and accounted for at fair value through earnings the company generally does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact these vies’ economic performance and thus it does not consolidate them

 municipal securities tender option bond tob trusts tob trusts hold fixed and floatingrate taxable and taxexempt securities issued by state and local governments and municipalities the trusts are typically singleissuer trusts whose assets are purchased from the company or from other investors in the municipal securities market the tob trusts fund the purchase of their assets by issuing longterm putable floating rate certificates floaters and residual certificates residuals the trusts are referred to as tender option bond trusts because the floater holders have the ability to tender their interests periodically back to the issuing trust as described further below the floaters and residuals evidence beneficial ownership interests in and are collateralized by the underlying assets of the trust the floaters are held by thirdparty investors typically taxexempt money market funds the residuals are typically held by the original owner of the municipal securities being financed   the floaters and the residuals have a tenor that is equal to or shorter than the tenor of the underlying municipal bonds the residuals entitle their holders to the residual cash flows from the issuing trust the interest income generated by the underlying municipal securities net of interest paid on the floaters and trust expenses the residuals are rated based on the longterm rating of the underlying municipal bond the floaters bear variable interest rates that are reset periodically to a new market rate based on a spread to a high grade shortterm taxexempt index the floaters have a longterm rating based on the longterm rating of the underlying municipal bond and a shortterm rating based on that of the liquidity provider to the trust   there are two kinds of tob trusts customer tob trusts and noncustomer tob trusts customer tob trusts are trusts through which customers finance their investments in municipal securities the residuals are held by customers and the floaters by thirdparty investors typically taxexempt money market funds noncustomer tob trusts are trusts through which the company finances its own investments in municipal securities in such trusts the company holds the residuals and thirdparty investors typically taxexempt money market funds hold the floaters 

  the company serves as remarketing agent to the trusts placing the floaters with thirdparty investors at inception facilitating the periodic reset of the variable rate of interest on the floaters and remarketing any tendered floaters if floaters are tendered and the company in its role as remarketing agent is unable to find a new investor within a specified period of time it can declare a failed remarketing in which case the trust is unwound the company may but is not obligated to buy the floaters into its own inventory the level of the company’s inventory of floaters fluctuates over time as of december 31 2011 the company held 120 million of floaters related to both customer and noncustomer tob trusts   for certain noncustomer trusts the company also provides credit enhancement approximately 240 million of the municipal bonds owned by tob trusts have a credit guarantee provided by the company   the company provides liquidity to many of the outstanding trusts if a trust is unwound early due to an event other than a credit event on the underlying municipal bond the underlying municipal bonds are sold in the market if there is a shortfall in the trust’s cash flows between the redemption price of the tendered floaters and the proceeds from the sale of the underlying municipal bonds the trust draws on a liquidity agreement in an amount equal to the shortfall for customer tobs where the residual is less than 25 of the trust’s capital structure the company has a reimbursement agreement with the residual holder under which the residual holder reimburses the company for any payment made under the liquidity arrangement through this reimbursement agreement the residual holder remains economically exposed to fluctuations in value of the underlying municipal bonds these reimbursement agreements are generally subject to daily margining based on changes in value of the underlying municipal bond in cases where a third party provides liquidity to a noncustomer tob trust a similar reimbursement arrangement is made whereby the company or a consolidated subsidiary of the company as residual holder absorbs any losses incurred by the liquidity provider   as of december 31 2011 liquidity agreements provided with respect to customer tob trusts totaled 54 billion of which 40 billion was offset by reimbursement agreements the remaining exposure related to tob transactions where the residual owned by the customer was at least 25 of the bond value at the inception of the transaction and no reimbursement agreement was executed the company also provides other liquidity agreements or letters of credit to customersponsored municipal investment funds that are not variable interest entities and municipalityrelated issuers that totaled 117 billion as of december 31 2011 these liquidity agreements and letters of credit are offset by reimbursement agreements with various termout provisions in addition as of december 31 2011 the company has provided liquidity arrangements with a notional amount of 20 million for other nonconsolidated noncustomer tob trusts described below 

  the company considers the customer and noncustomer tob trusts to be vies customer tob trusts are not consolidated by the company the company has concluded that the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the customer tob trusts is primarily held by the customer residual holder who may unilaterally cause the sale of the trust’s bonds   noncustomer tob trusts generally are consolidated similar to customer tob trusts the company has concluded that the power over the noncustomer tob trusts is primarily held by the residual holder which may unilaterally cause the sale of the trust’s bonds because the company holds the residual interest and thus has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the trust’s economic performance it consolidates the noncustomer tob trusts   total assets in noncustomer tob trusts also include 22 million of assets where the residuals are held by hedge funds that are consolidated and managed by the company the assets and the associated liabilities of these tob trusts are not consolidated by the hedge funds and thus are not consolidated by the company under the application of asc 946 financial services—investment companies  which precludes consolidation of owned investments the company consolidates the hedge funds because the company holds controlling financial interests in the hedge funds certain of the company’s equity investments in the hedge funds are hedged with derivatives transactions executed by the company with third parties referencing the returns of the hedge fund 

municipal investments municipal investment transactions include debt and equity interests in partnerships that finance the construction and rehabilitation of lowincome housing facilitate lending in new or underserved markets or finance the construction or operation of renewable municipal energy facilities the company generally invests in these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits and grants earned from the investments made by the partnership the company may also provide construction loans or permanent loans to the development or continuation of real estate properties held by partnerships these entities are generally considered vies the power to direct the activities of these entities is typically held by the general partner accordingly these entities are not consolidated by the company 

client intermediation client intermediation transactions represent a range of transactions designed to provide investors with specified returns based on the returns of an underlying security referenced asset or index these transactions include creditlinked notes and equitylinked notes in these transactions the vie typically obtains exposure to the underlying security referenced asset or index through a derivative instrument such as a totalreturn swap or a creditdefault swap in turn the vie issues notes to investors that pay a return based on the specified underlying security referenced asset or index the vie invests the proceeds in a financial asset or a guaranteed insurance contract gic that serves as collateral for the derivative contract over the term of the transaction the company’s involvement in these transactions includes being the counterparty to the vie’s derivative instruments and investing in a portion of the notes issued by the vie in certain transactions the investor’s maximum risk of loss is limited and the company absorbs risk of loss above a specified level the company does not have the power to direct the activities of the vies that most significantly impact their economic performance and thus it does not consolidate them   the company’s maximum risk of loss in these transactions is defined as the amount invested in notes issued by the vie and the notional amount of any risk of loss absorbed by the company through a separate instrument issued by the vie the derivative instrument held by the company may generate a receivable from the vie for example where the company purchases credit protection from the vie in connection with the vie’s issuance of a creditlinked note which is collateralized by the assets owned by the vie these derivative instruments are not considered variable interests and any associated receivables are not included in the calculation of maximum exposure to the vie 

investment funds the company is the investment manager for certain investment funds that invest in various asset classes including private equity hedge funds real estate fixed income and infrastructure the company earns a management fee which is a percentage of capital under management and may earn performance fees in addition for some of these funds the company has an ownership interest in the investment funds the company has also established a number of investment funds as opportunities for qualified employees to invest in private equity investments the company acts as investment manager to these funds and may provide employees with financing on both recourse and nonrecourse bases for a portion of the employees’ investment commitments

futures and forward contracts which are commitments to buy or sell at a future date a financial instrument commodity or currency at a contracted price and may be settled in cash or through delivery swap contracts which are commitments to settle in cash at a future date or dates that may range from a few days to a number of years based on differentials between specified financial indices as applied to a notional principal amount option contracts which give the purchaser for a premium the right but not the obligation to buy or sell within a specified time a financial instrument commodity or currency at a contracted price that may also be settled in cash based on differentials between specified indices or prices   citigroup enters into these derivative contracts relating to interest rate foreign currency commodity and other marketcredit risks for the following reasons 

trading purposes—customer needs citigroup offers its customers derivatives in connection with their riskmanagement actions to transfer modify or reduce their interest rate foreign exchange and other marketcredit risks or for their own trading purposes as part of this process citigroup considers the customers’ suitability for the risk involved and the business purpose for the transaction citigroup also manages its derivative risk positions through offsetting trade activities controls focused on price verification and daily reporting of positions to senior managers trading purposes—own account citigroup trades derivatives for its own account and as an active market maker trading limits and price verification controls are key aspects of this activity hedging— citigroup uses derivatives in connection with its risk management activities to hedge certain risks or reposition the risk profile of the company for example citigroup issues fixedrate longterm debt and then enters into a receivefixed payvariablerate interest rate swap with the same tenor and notional amount to convert the interest payments to a net variablerate basis this strategy is the most common form of an interest rate hedge as it minimizes interest cost in certain yield curve environments derivatives are also used to manage risks inherent in specific groups of onbalancesheet assets and liabilities including afs securities and deposit liabilities as well as other interestsensitive assets and liabilities in addition foreignexchange contracts are used to hedge nonusdollardenominated debt foreigncurrencydenominated availableforsale securities and net investment exposures

accounting for derivative hedging citigroup accounts for its hedging activities in accordance with asc 815 derivatives and hedging formerly sfas 133 as a general rule hedge accounting is permitted where the company is exposed to a particular risk such as interestrate or foreignexchange risk that causes changes in the fair value of an asset or liability or variability in the expected future cash flows of an existing asset liability or a forecasted transaction that may affect earnings   derivative contracts hedging the risks associated with the changes in fair value are referred to as fair value hedges while contracts hedging the risks affecting the expected future cash flows are called cash flow hedges hedges that utilize derivatives or debt instruments to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with equity investments in nonusdollarfunctionalcurrency foreign subsidiaries net investment in a foreign operation are called net investment hedges   if certain hedging criteria specified in asc 815 are met including testing for hedge effectiveness special hedge accounting may be applied the hedge effectiveness assessment methodologies for similar hedges are performed in a similar manner and are used consistently throughout the hedging relationships for fair value hedges the changes in value of the hedging derivative as well as the changes in value of the related hedged item due to the risk being hedged are reflected in current earnings for cash flow hedges and net investment hedges the changes in value of the hedging derivative are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in citigroup’s stockholders’ equity to the extent the hedge is effective hedge ineffectiveness in either case is reflected in current earnings 

  for assetliability management hedging the fixedrate longterm debt would be recorded at amortized cost under current us gaap however by electing to use asc 815 sfas 133 fair value hedge accounting the carrying value of the debt is adjusted for changes in the benchmark interest rate with any such changes in value recorded in current earnings the related interestrate swap is also recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with any changes in fair value reflected in earnings thus any ineffectiveness resulting from the hedging relationship is recorded in current earnings alternatively a management hedge which does not meet the asc 815 hedging criteria would involve recording only the derivative at fair value on the balance sheet with its associated changes in fair value recorded in earnings the debt would continue to be carried at amortized cost and therefore current earnings would be impacted only by the interest rate shifts and other factors that cause the change in the swap’s value and may change the underlying yield of the debt this type of hedge is undertaken when hedging requirements cannot be achieved or management decides not to apply asc 815 hedge accounting another alternative for the company would be to elect to carry the debt at fair value under the fair value option once the irrevocable election is made upon issuance of the debt the full change in fair value of the debt would be reported in earnings the related interest rate swap with changes in fair value would also be reflected in earnings and provides a natural offset to the debt’s fair value change to the extent the two offsets are not exactly equal the difference would be reflected in current earnings   key aspects of achieving asc 815 hedge accounting are documentation of hedging strategy and hedge effectiveness at the hedge inception and substantiating hedge effectiveness on an ongoing basis a derivative must be highly effective in accomplishing the hedge objective of offsetting either changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item for the risk being hedged any ineffectiveness in the hedge relationship is recognized in current earnings the assessment of effectiveness excludes changes in the value of the hedged item that are unrelated to the risks being hedged similarly the assessment of effectiveness may exclude changes in the fair value of a derivative related to time value that if excluded are recognized in current earnings 

fair value hedges 

hedging of benchmark interest rate risk citigroup hedges exposure to changes in the fair value of outstanding fixedrate issued debt and certificates of deposit the fixed cash flows from those financing transactions are converted to benchmark variablerate cash flows by entering into receivefixed payvariable interest rate swaps some of these fair value hedge relationships use dollaroffset ratio analysis to determine whether the hedging relationships are highly effective at inception and on an ongoing basis while others use regression   citigroup also hedges exposure to changes in the fair value of fixedrate assets including availableforsale debt securities and loans the hedging instruments used are receivevariable payfixed interest rate swaps some of these fair value hedging relationships use dollaroffset ratio analysis to determine whether the hedging relationships are highly effective at inception and on an ongoing basis while others use regression analysis 

hedging of foreign exchange risk citigroup hedges the change in fair value attributable to foreignexchange rate movements in availableforsale securities that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity holding the securities which may be within or outside the us the hedging instrument employed is a forward foreignexchange contract in this type of hedge the change in fair value of the hedged availableforsale security attributable to the portion of foreign exchange risk hedged is reported in earnings and not accumulated other comprehensive income —a process that serves to offset substantially the change in fair value of the forward contract that is also reflected in earnings citigroup considers the premium associated with forward contracts differential between spot and contractual forward rates as the cost of hedging this is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and reflected directly in earnings the dollaroffset method is used to assess hedge effectiveness since that assessment is based on changes in fair value attributable to changes in spot rates on both the availableforsale securities and the forward contracts for the portion of the relationship hedged the amount of hedge ineffectiveness is not significant 

the following table summarizes the gains losses on the company’s fair value hedges for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 

  cash flow hedges 

hedging of benchmark interest rate risk citigroup hedges variable cash flows resulting from floatingrate liabilities and rollover reissuance of shortterm liabilities variable cash flows from those liabilities are converted to fixedrate cash flows by entering into receivevariable payfixed interest rate swaps and receivevariable payfixed forwardstarting interest rate swaps these cashflow hedging relationships use either regression analysis or dollaroffset ratio analysis to assess whether the hedging relationships are highly effective at inception and on an ongoing basis when certain interest rates do not qualify as a benchmark interest rate citigroup designates the risk being hedged as the risk of overall changes in the hedged cash flows since efforts are made to match the terms of the derivatives to those of the hedged forecasted cash flows as closely as possible the amount of hedge ineffectiveness is not significant 

hedging of foreign exchange risk citigroup locks in the functional currency equivalent cash flows of longterm debt and shortterm borrowings that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the issuing entity depending on the risk management objectives these types of hedges are designated as either cash flow hedges of only foreign exchange risk or cash flow hedges of both foreign exchange and interest rate risk and the hedging instruments used are foreign exchange crosscurrency swaps and forward contracts these cash flow hedge relationships use dollaroffset ratio analysis to determine whether the hedging relationships are highly effective at inception and on an ongoing basis 

hedging total return citigroup generally manages the risk associated with highly leveraged financing it has entered into by seeking to sell a majority of its exposures to the market prior to or shortly after funding the portion of the highly leveraged financing that is retained by citigroup is generally hedged with a total return swap   the amount of hedge ineffectiveness on the cash flow hedges recognized in earnings for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 is not significant 

the pretax change in accumulated other comprehensive income loss from cash flow hedges for is presented below 

    for cash flow hedges any changes in the fair value of the enduser derivative remaining in accumulated other comprehensive income loss on the consolidated balance sheet will be included in earnings of future periods to offset the variability of the hedged cash flows when such cash flows affect earnings the net loss associated with cash flow hedges expected to be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income loss within 12 months of december 31 2011 is approximately 11 billion the maximum length of time over which forecasted cash flows are hedged is 10 years   the aftertax impact of cash flow hedges on aoci is shown in note 21 to the consolidated financial statement 

net investment hedges consistent with asc 83020 foreign currency matters—foreign currency transactions  formerly sfas 52 foreign currency translation  asc 815 allows hedging of the foreign currency risk of a net investment in a foreign operation citigroup uses foreign currency forwards options swaps and foreigncurrencydenominated debt instruments to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with citigroup’s equity investments in several nonus dollar functional currency foreign subsidiaries citigroup records the change in the carrying amount of these investments in the foreign currency translation adjustment account within accumulated other comprehensive income loss  simultaneously the effective portion of the hedge of this exposure is also recorded in the foreign currency translation adjustment account and the ineffective portion if any is immediately recorded in earnings   for derivatives used in net investment hedges citigroup follows the forwardrate method from fasb derivative implementation group issue h8 now asc 815353516 through 3526 “foreign currency hedges measuring the amount of ineffectiveness in a net investment hedge” according to that method all changes in fair value including changes related to the forwardrate component of the foreign currency forward contracts and the time value of foreign currency options are recorded in the foreign currency translation adjustment account within accumulated other comprehensive income loss  

  for foreigncurrencydenominated debt instruments that are designated as hedges of net investments the translation gain or loss that is recorded in the foreign currency translation adjustment account is based on the spot exchange rate between the functional currency of the respective subsidiary and the us dollar which is the functional currency of citigroup to the extent the notional amount of the hedging instrument exactly matches the hedged net investment and the underlying exchange rate of the derivative hedging instrument relates to the exchange rate between the functional currency of the net investment and citigroup’s functional currency or in the case of a nonderivative debt instrument such instrument is denominated in the functional currency of the net investment no ineffectiveness is recorded in earnings   the pretax gain loss recorded in the foreign currency translation adjustment account within accumulated other comprehensive income loss  related to the effective portion of the net investment hedges is 904 million 3620 million and 4727 million for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

credit derivatives a credit derivative is a bilateral contract between a buyer and a seller under which the seller agrees to provide protection to the buyer against the credit risk of a particular entity “reference entity” or “reference credit” credit derivatives generally require that the seller of credit protection make payments to the buyer upon the occurrence of predefined credit events commonly referred to as “settlement triggers” these settlement triggers are defined by the form of the derivative and the reference credit and are generally limited to the market standard of failure to pay on indebtedness and bankruptcy of the reference credit and in a more limited range of transactions debt restructuring credit derivative transactions referring to emerging market reference credits will also typically include additional settlement triggers to cover the acceleration of indebtedness and the risk of repudiation or a payment moratorium in certain transactions protection may be provided on a portfolio of referenced credits or assetbacked securities the seller of such protection may not be required to make payment until a specified amount of losses has occurred with respect to the portfolio andor may only be required to pay for losses up to a specified amount 

  the company makes markets in and trades a range of credit derivatives both on behalf of clients as well as for its own account through these contracts the company either purchases or writes protection on either a single name or a portfolio of reference credits the company uses credit derivatives to help mitigate credit risk in its corporate and consumer loan portfolios and other cash positions to take proprietary trading positions and to facilitate client transactions   the range of credit derivatives sold includes credit default swaps total return swaps credit options and creditlinked notes   a credit default swap is a contract in which for a fee a protection seller agrees to reimburse a protection buyer for any losses that occur due to a credit event on a reference entity if there is no credit default event or settlement trigger as defined by the specific derivative contract then the protection seller makes no payments to the protection buyer and receives only the contractually specified fee however if a credit event occurs as defined in the specific derivative contract sold the protection seller will be required to make a payment to the protection buyer   a total return swap transfers the total economic performance of a reference asset which includes all associated cash flows as well as capital appreciation or depreciation the protection buyer receives a floating rate of interest and any depreciation on the reference asset from the protection seller and in return the protection seller receives the cash flows associated with the reference asset plus any appreciation thus according to the total return swap agreement the protection seller will be obligated to make a payment any time the floating interest rate payment and any depreciation of the reference asset exceed the cash flows associated with the underlying asset a total return swap may terminate upon a default of the reference asset subject to the provisions of the related total return swap agreement between the protection seller and the protection buyer   a credit option is a credit derivative that allows investors to trade or hedge changes in the credit quality of the reference asset for example in a credit spread option the option writer assumes the obligation to purchase or sell the reference asset at a specified “strike” spread level the option purchaser buys the right to sell the reference asset to or purchase it from the option writer at the strike spread level the payments on credit spread options depend either on a particular credit spread or the price of the underlying creditsensitive asset the options usually terminate if the underlying assets default   a creditlinked note is a form of credit derivative structured as a debt security with an embedded credit default swap the purchaser of the note writes credit protection to the issuer and receives a return which will be negatively affected by credit events on the underlying reference credit if the reference entity defaults the purchaser of the creditlinked note may assume the long position in the debt security and any future cash flows from it but will lose the amount paid to the issuer of the creditlinked note thus the maximum amount of the exposure is the carrying amount of the creditlinked note as of december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 the amount of creditlinked notes held by the company in trading inventory was immaterial 

  the following tables summarize the key characteristics of the company’s credit derivative portfolio as protection seller as of december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 

    

  citigroup evaluates the paymentperformance risk of the credit derivatives for which it stands as a protection seller based on the credit rating assigned to the underlying referenced credit where external ratings by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations such as moody’s and sp are used investment grade ratings are considered to be baabbb or above while anything below is considered noninvestment grade the citigroup internal ratings are in line with the related external credit rating system on certain underlying reference credits mainly related to overthecounter credit derivatives ratings are not available and these are included in the notrated category credit derivatives written on an underlying noninvestment grade reference credit represent greater payment risk to the company the noninvestment grade category in the table above primarily includes credit derivatives where the underlying referenced entity has been downgraded subsequent to the inception of the derivative   the maximum potential amount of future payments under credit derivative contracts presented in the table above is based on the notional value of the derivatives the company believes that the maximum potential amount of future payments for credit protection sold is not representative of the actual loss exposure based on historical experience this amount has not been reduced by the company’s rights to the underlying assets and the related cash flows in accordance with most credit derivative contracts should a credit event or settlement trigger occur the company is usually liable for the difference between the protection sold and the recourse it holds in the value of the underlying assets thus if the reference entity defaults citi will generally have a right to collect on the underlying reference credit and any related cash flows while being liable for the full notional amount of credit protection sold to the buyer furthermore this maximum potential amount of future payments for credit protection sold has not been reduced for any cash collateral paid to a given counterparty as such payments would be calculated after netting all derivative exposures including any credit derivatives with that counterparty in accordance with a related master netting agreement due to such netting processes determining the amount of collateral that corresponds to credit derivative exposures alone is not possible the company actively monitors open credit risk exposures and manages this exposure by using a variety of strategies including purchased credit derivatives cash collateral or direct holdings of the referenced assets this risk mitigation activity is not captured in the table above 

creditriskrelated contingent features in derivatives certain derivative instruments contain provisions that require the company to either post additional collateral or immediately settle any outstanding liability balances upon the occurrence of a specified creditriskrelated event these events which are defined by the existing derivative contracts are primarily downgrades in the credit ratings of the company and its affiliates the fair value excluding cva of all derivative instruments with creditriskrelated contingent features that are in a liability position at december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 is 26 billion and 23 billion respectively the company has posted 21 billion and 18 billion as collateral for this exposure in the normal course of business as of december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 respectively each downgrade would trigger additional collateral requirements for the company and its affiliates in the event that each legal entity was downgraded a single notch as of december 31 2011 the company would be required to post additional collateral of 31 billion 

24 concentrations of credit risk 

concentrations of credit risk exist when changes in economic industry or geographic factors similarly affect groups of counterparties whose aggregate credit exposure is material in relation to citigroup’s total credit exposure although citigroup’s portfolio of financial instruments is broadly diversified along industry product and geographic lines material transactions are completed with other financial institutions particularly in the securities trading derivatives and foreign exchange businesses   in connection with the company’s efforts to maintain a diversified portfolio the company limits its exposure to any one geographic region country or individual creditor and monitors this exposure on a continuous basis at december 31 2011 citigroup’s most significant concentration of credit risk was with the us government and its agencies the company’s exposure which primarily results from trading assets and investments issued by the us government and its agencies amounted to 1779 billion and 1764 billion at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively the japanese and mexican governments and their agencies which are rated investment grade by both moody’s and sp were the next largest exposures the company’s exposure to japan amounted to 332 billion and 392 billion at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively and was composed of investment securities loans and trading assets the company’s exposure to mexico amounted to 295 billion and 442 billion at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively and was composed of investment securities loans and trading assets   the company’s exposure to state and municipalities amounted to 395 billion and 347 billion at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively and was composed of trading assets investment securities derivatives and lending activities 

25 fair value measurement 

asc 82010 formerly sfas 157 defines fair value establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure requirements about fair value measurements fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date among other things the standard requires the company to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value in addition the use of block discounts is precluded when measuring the fair value of instruments traded in an active market it also requires recognition of tradedate gains related to certain derivative transactions whose fair values have been determined using unobservable market inputs   under asc 82010 the probability of default of a counterparty is factored into the valuation of derivative positions and includes the impact of citigroup’s own credit risk on derivatives and other liabilities measured at fair value 

fair value hierarchy asc 82010 fair value measurement  specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources while unobservable inputs reflect the company’s market assumptions these two types of inputs have created the following fair value hierarchy 

level 1 quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets level 2 quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and modelderived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets level 3 valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable   this hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available the company considers relevant and observable market prices in its valuations where possible the frequency of transactions the size of the bidask spread and the amount of adjustment necessary when comparing similar transactions are all factors in determining the liquidity of markets and the relevance of observed prices in those markets   the company’s policy with respect to transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy is to recognize transfers into and out of each level as of the end of the reporting period 

determination of fair value for assets and liabilities carried at fair value the company measures such value using the procedures set out below irrespective of whether these assets and liabilities are carried at fair value as a result of an election or whether they were previously carried at fair value   when available the company generally uses quoted market prices to determine fair value and classifies such items as level 1 in some cases where a market price is available the company will make use of acceptable practical expedients such as matrix pricing to calculate fair value in which case the items are classified as level 2   if quoted market prices are not available fair value is based upon internally developed valuation techniques that use where possible current marketbased or independently sourced market parameters such as interest rates currency rates option volatilities etc items valued using such internally generated valuation techniques are classified according to the lowest level input or value driver that is significant to the valuation thus an item may be classified in level 3 even though there may be some significant inputs that are readily observable   where available the company may also make use of quoted prices for recent trading activity in positions with the same or similar characteristics to that being valued the frequency and size of transactions and the amount of the bidask spread are among the factors considered in determining the liquidity of markets and the relevance of observed prices from those markets if relevant and observable prices are available those valuations would be classified as level 2 if prices are not available other valuation techniques would be used and the item would be classified as level 3   fair value estimates from internal valuation techniques are verified where possible to prices obtained from independent vendors or brokers vendors and brokers’ valuations may be based on a variety of inputs ranging from observed prices to proprietary valuation models   the following section describes the valuation methodologies used by the company to measure various financial instruments at fair value including an indication of the level in the fair value hierarchy in which each instrument is generally classified where appropriate the description includes details of the valuation models the key inputs to those models and any significant assumptions 

securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under agreements to repurchase no quoted prices exist for such instruments and so fair value is determined using a discounted cashflow technique cash flows are estimated based on the terms of the contract taking into account any embedded derivative or other features expected cash flows are discounted using market rates appropriate to the maturity of the instrument as well as the nature and amount of collateral taken or received generally when such instruments are held at fair value they are classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as the inputs used in the valuation are readily observable 

trading account assets and liabilities—trading securities and trading loans when available the company uses quoted market prices to determine the fair value of trading securities such items are classified as level 1 of the fair value hierarchy examples include some government securities and exchangetraded equity securities   for bonds and secondary market loans traded over the counter the company generally determines fair value utilizing internal valuation techniques fair value estimates from internal valuation techniques are verified where possible to prices obtained from independent vendors vendors compile prices from various sources and may apply matrix pricing for similar bonds or loans where no price is observable if available the company may also use quoted prices for recent trading activity of assets with similar characteristics to the bond or loan being valued trading securities and loans priced using such methods are generally classified as level 2 however when less liquidity exists for a security or loan a quoted price is stale or prices from independent sources vary a loan or security is generally classified as level 3   where the company’s principal market for a portfolio of loans is the securitization market the company uses the securitization price to determine the fair value of the portfolio the securitization price is determined from the assumed proceeds of a hypothetical securitization in the current market adjusted for transformation costs ie direct costs other than transaction costs and securitization uncertainties such as market conditions and liquidity as a result of the severe reduction in the level of activity in certain securitization markets since the second half of 2007 observable securitization prices for certain directly comparable portfolios of loans have not been readily available therefore such portfolios of loans are generally classified as level 3 of the fair value hierarchy however for other loan securitization markets such as commercial real estate loans pricing verification of the hypothetical securitizations has been possible since these markets have remained active accordingly this loan portfolio is classified as level 2 in the fair value hierarchy 

trading account assets and liabilities—derivatives exchangetraded derivatives are generally fair valued using quoted market ie exchange prices and so are classified as level 1 of the fair value hierarchy   the majority of derivatives entered into by the company are executed over the counter and so are valued using internal valuation techniques as no quoted market prices exist for such instruments the valuation techniques and inputs depend on the type of derivative and the nature of the underlying instrument the principal techniques used to value these instruments are discounted cash flows blackscholes and monte carlo simulation the fair values of derivative contracts reflect cash the company has paid or received for example option premiums paid and received   the key inputs depend upon the type of derivative and the nature of the underlying instrument and include interest rate yield curves foreignexchange rates the spot price of the underlying volatility and correlation the item is placed in either level 2 or level 3 depending on the observability of the significant inputs to the model correlation and items with longer tenors are generally less observable   in the fourth quarter of 2011 the company began incorporating overnight indexed swap “ois” curves as fair value measurement inputs for the valuation of certain collateralized interestrate related derivatives the ois curves reflect the interest rates paid on cash collateral provided against the fair value of these derivatives the company believes using relevant ois curves as inputs to determine fair value measurements provides a more representative reflection of the fair value of these collateralized interestrate related derivatives previously the company used the relevant benchmark curve for the currency of the derivative eg the london interbank offered rate for us dollar derivatives as the discount rate for these collateralized interestrate related derivatives the company recognized a pretax gain of approximately 167 million upon the change in this fair value measurement input for further information on derivative instruments and hedging activities see note 23 

subprimerelated direct exposures in cdos the valuation of highgrade and mezzanine assetbacked security abs cdo positions uses trader prices based on the underlying assets of each highgrade and mezzanine abs cdo the highgrade and mezzanine positions are now largely hedged through the abx and bond short positions which are trader priced this results in closer symmetry in the way these long and short positions are valued by the company citigroup uses trader marks to value this portion of the portfolio and will do so as long as it remains largely hedged   for most of the lending and structuring direct subprime exposures fair value is determined utilizing observable transactions where available other market data for similar assets in markets that are not active and other internal valuation techniques 

investments the investments category includes availableforsale debt and marketable equity securities whose fair value is determined using the same procedures described for trading securities above or in some cases using vendor prices as the primary source   also included in investments are nonpublic investments in private equity and real estate entities held by the sb business determining the fair value of nonpublic securities involves a significant degree of management resources and judgment as no quoted prices exist and such securities are generally very thinly traded in addition there may be transfer restrictions on private equity securities the company uses an established process for determining the fair value of such securities using commonly accepted valuation techniques including the use of earnings multiples based on comparable public securities industryspecific nonearningsbased multiples and discounted cash flow models in determining the fair value of nonpublic securities the company also considers events such as a proposed sale of the investee company initial public offerings equity issuances or other observable transactions as discussed in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements the company uses nav to value certain of these entities   private equity securities are generally classified as level 3 of the fair value hierarchy 

shortterm borrowings and longterm debt where fair value accounting has been elected the fair values of nonstructured liabilities are determined by discounting expected cash flows using the appropriate discount rate for the applicable maturity such instruments are generally classified as level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as all inputs are readily observable   the company determines the fair values of structured liabilities where performance is linked to structured interest rates inflation or currency risks and hybrid financial instruments performance linked to risks other than interest rates inflation or currency risks using the appropriate derivative valuation methodology described above given the nature of the embedded risk profile such instruments are classified as level 2 or level 3 depending on the observability of significant inputs to the model 

market valuation adjustments liquidity adjustments are applied to items in level 2 and level 3 of the fair value hierarchy to ensure that the fair value reflects the price at which the entire position could be liquidated in an orderly manner the liquidity reserve is based on the bidoffer spread for an instrument adjusted to take into account the size of the position consistent with what citi believes a market participant would consider   counterparty creditrisk adjustments are applied to derivatives such as overthecounter derivatives where the base valuation uses market parameters based on the libor interest rate curves not all counterparties have the same credit risk as that implied by the relevant libor curve so it is necessary to consider the market view of the credit risk of a counterparty in order to estimate the fair value of such an item   bilateral or “own” creditrisk adjustments are applied to reflect the company’s own credit risk when valuing derivatives and liabilities measured at fair value counterparty and own credit adjustments consider the expected future cash flows between citi and its counterparties under the terms of the instrument and the effect of credit risk on the valuation of those cash flows rather than a pointintime assessment of the current recognized net asset or liability furthermore the creditrisk adjustments take into account the effect of creditrisk mitigants such as pledged collateral and any legal right of offset to the extent such offset exists with a counterparty through arrangements such as netting agreements 

auction rate securities auction rate securities ars are longterm municipal bonds corporate bonds securitizations and preferred stocks with interest rates or dividend yields that are reset through periodic auctions the coupon paid in the current period is based on the rate determined by the prior auction in the event of an auction failure ars holders receive a “fail rate” coupon which is specified in the original issue documentation of each ars   where insufficient orders to purchase all of the ars issue to be sold in an auction were received the primary dealer or auction agent would traditionally have purchased any residual unsold inventory without a contractual obligation to do so this residual inventory would then be repaid through subsequent auctions typically in a short time due to this auction mechanism and generally liquid market ars have historically traded and were valued as shortterm instruments 

  citigroup acted in the capacity of primary dealer for approximately 72 billion of ars and continued to purchase residual unsold inventory in support of the auction mechanism until midfebruary 2008 after this date liquidity in the ars market deteriorated significantly auctions failed due to a lack of bids from thirdparty investors and citigroup ceased to purchase unsold inventory following a number of ars refinancings at december 31 2011 citigroup continued to act in the capacity of primary dealer for approximately 15 billion of outstanding ars   the company classifies its ars as trading and availableforsale securities trading ars include primarily securitization positions and are classified as assetbacked securities within trading securities in the table below availableforsale ars include primarily preferred instruments interests in closedend mutual funds and are classified as equity securities within investments   prior to the company’s first auction failing in the first quarter of 2008 citigroup valued ars based on observation of auction market prices because the auctions had a short maturity period 7 28 or 35 days this generally resulted in valuations at par once the auctions failed ars could no longer be valued using observation of auction market prices accordingly the fair values of ars are currently estimated using internally developed discounted cash flow valuation techniques specific to the nature of the assets underlying each ars   for ars with student loans as underlying assets future cash flows are estimated based on the terms of the loans underlying each individual ars discounted at an appropriate rate in order to estimate the current fair value the key assumptions that impact the ars valuations are the expected weighted average life of the structure estimated fail rate coupons the amount of leverage in each structure and the discount rate used to calculate the present value of projected cash flows the discount rate used for each ars is based on rates observed for basic securitizations with similar maturities to the loans underlying each ars being valued in order to arrive at the appropriate discount rate these observed rates were adjusted upward to factor in the specifics of the ars structure being valued such as callability and the illiquidity in the ars market   the majority of ars continue to be classified as level 3 

alta mortgage securities the company classifies its alta mortgage securities as heldtomaturity availableforsale and trading investments the securities classified as trading and availableforsale are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value reported in current earnings and aoci respectively for these purposes citi defines alta mortgage securities as nonagency residential mortgagebacked securities rmbs where 1 the underlying collateral has weighted average fico scores between 680 and 720 or 2 for instances where fico scores are greater than 720 rmbs have 30 or less of the underlying collateral composed of full documentation loans   similar to the valuation methodologies used for other trading securities and trading loans the company generally determines the fair values of alta mortgage securities utilizing internal valuation techniques fair value estimates from internal valuation techniques are verified where possible to prices obtained from independent vendors vendors compile prices from various sources where available the company may also make use of quoted prices for recent trading activity in securities with the same or similar characteristics to the security being valued   the internal valuation techniques used for alta mortgage securities as with other mortgage exposures consider estimated housing price changes unemployment rates interest rates and borrower attributes they also consider prepayment rates as well as other market indicators   alta mortgage securities that are valued using these methods are generally classified as level 2 however alta mortgage securities backed by alta mortgages of lower quality or more recent vintages are mostly classified as level 3 due to the reduced liquidity that exists for such positions which reduces the reliability of prices available from independent sources 

commercial real estate exposure citigroup reports a number of different exposures linked to commercial real estate at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings including securities loans and investments in entities that hold commercial real estate loans or commercial real estate directly the company also reports securities backed by commercial real estate as availableforsale investments which are carried at fair value with changes in fair value reported in aoci   similar to the valuation methodologies used for other trading securities and trading loans the company generally determines the fair value of securities and loans linked to commercial real estate utilizing internal valuation techniques fair value estimates from internal valuation techniques are verified where possible to prices obtained from independent vendors vendors compile prices from various sources where available the company may also make use of quoted prices for recent trading activity in securities or loans with the same or similar characteristics to that being valued securities and loans linked to commercial real estate valued using these methodologies are generally classified as level 3 as a result of the current reduced liquidity in the market for such exposures   the fair value of investments in entities that hold commercial real estate loans or commercial real estate directly is determined using a similar methodology to that used for other nonpublic investments in real estate held by the sb business the company uses an established process for determining the fair value of such securities using commonly accepted valuation techniques including the use of earnings multiples based on comparable public securities industryspecific nonearningsbased multiples and discounted cash flow models in determining the fair value of such investments the company also considers events such as a proposed sale of the investee company initial public offerings equity issuances or other observable transactions such investments are generally classified as level 3 of the fair value hierarchy 

items measured at fair value on a recurring basis the following tables present for each of the fair value hierarchy levels the company’s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis at december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 the company’s hedging of positions that have been classified in the level 3 category is not limited to other financial 

instruments that have been classified as level 3 but also instruments classified as level 1 or level 2 of the fair value hierarchy the effects of these hedges are presented gross in the following table

changes in level 3 fair value category the following tables present the changes in the level 3 fair value category for the twelve months ended december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 the company classifies financial instruments in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy when there is reliance on at least one significant unobservable input to the valuation model in addition to these unobservable inputs the valuation models for level 3 financial instruments typically also rely on a number of inputs that are readily observable either directly or indirectly thus the gains and losses presented below include changes in the fair value related to both observable and unobservable inputs 

  the company often hedges positions with offsetting positions that are classified in a different level for example the gains and losses for assets and liabilities in the level 3 category presented in the tables below do not reflect the effect of offsetting losses and gains on hedging instruments that have been classified by the company in the level 1 and level 2 categories in addition the company hedges items classified in the level 3 category with instruments also classified in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy the effects of these hedges are presented gross in the following tables

the change in expected maturities in structured reverse repo transactions is the embedded call option feature that enables the investor the company to elect to terminate the trade early during 2010 the decrease in interest rates caused the estimated maturity dates of certain structured reverse repos to lengthen to more than five years resulting in the transfer from level 2 to level 3

that it is probable the counterparty held the underlying instrument at the inception of the contract also are excluded from the disclosure above   in instances where the company’s maximum potential future payment is unlimited the notional amount of the contract is disclosed 

loans sold with recourse loans sold with recourse represent the company’s obligations to reimburse the buyers for loan losses under certain circumstances recourse refers to the clause in a sales agreement under which a lender will fully reimburse the buyerinvestor for any losses resulting from the purchased loans this may be accomplished by the seller’s taking back any loans that become delinquent   in addition to the amounts shown in the table above the repurchase reserve for consumer mortgages representations and warranties was 1188 million and 969 million at december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 respectively and these amounts are included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet   the repurchase reserve estimation process is subject to numerous estimates and judgments the assumptions used to calculate the repurchase reserve contain a level of uncertainty and risk that if different from actual results could have a material impact on the reserve amounts the key assumptions are 

loan documentation requests repurchase claims as a percentage of loan documentation requests claims appeal success rate and estimated loss per repurchase or makewhole   citi estimates that if there were a simultaneous 10 adverse change in each of the significant assumptions the repurchase reserve would increase by approximately 620 million as of december 31 2011 this potential change is hypothetical and intended to indicate the sensitivity of the repurchase reserve to changes in the key assumptions actual changes in the key assumptions may not occur at the same time or to the same degree ie an adverse change in one assumption may be offset by an improvement in another citi does not believe it has sufficient information to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss as defined under asc 450 relating to its consumer representations and warranties 

securities lending indemnifications owners of securities frequently lend those securities for a fee to other parties who may sell them short or deliver them to another party to satisfy some other obligation banks may administer such securities lending programs for their clients securities lending indemnifications are issued by the bank to guarantee that a securities lending customer will be made whole in the event that the security borrower does not return the security subject to the lending agreement and collateral held is insufficient to cover the market value of the security 

credit card merchant processing credit card merchant processing guarantees represent the company’s indirect obligations in connection with the processing of private label and bank card transactions on behalf of merchants   citigroup’s primary credit card business is the issuance of credit cards to individuals in addition the company a provides transaction processing services to various merchants with respect to its privatelabel cards and b has potential liability for bank card transaction processing services the nature of the liability in either case arises as a result of a billing dispute between a merchant and a cardholder that is ultimately resolved in the cardholder’s favor the merchant is liable to refund the amount to the cardholder in general if the credit card processing company is unable to collect this amount from the merchant the credit card processing company bears the loss for the amount of the credit or refund paid to the cardholder   with regard to a above the company continues to have the primary contingent liability with respect to its portfolio of privatelabel merchants the risk of loss is mitigated as the cash flows between the company and the merchant are settled on a net basis and the company has the right to offset any payments with cash flows otherwise due to the merchant to further mitigate this risk the company may delay settlement require a merchant to make an escrow deposit include event triggers to provide the company with more financial and operational control in the event of the financial deterioration of the merchant or require various credit enhancements including letters of credit and bank guarantees in the unlikely event that a privatelabel merchant is unable to deliver products services or a refund to its privatelabel cardholders the company is contingently liable to credit or refund cardholders   with regard to b above the company has a potential liability for bank card transactions where citi provides the transaction processing services as well as those where a third party provides the services and citi acts as a secondary guarantor should that processor fail to perform   the company’s maximum potential contingent liability related to both bank card and privatelabel merchant processing services is estimated to be the total volume of credit card transactions that meet the requirements to be valid charge back transactions at any given time at december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 this maximum potential exposure was estimated to be 70 billion and 65 billion respectively 

  however the company believes that the maximum exposure is not representative of the actual potential loss exposure based on the company’s historical experience this contingent liability is unlikely to arise as most products and services are delivered when purchased and amounts are refunded when items are returned to merchants the company assesses the probability and amount of its contingent liability related to merchant processing based on the financial strength of the primary guarantor the extent and nature of unresolved chargebacks and its historical loss experience at december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 the estimated losses incurred and the carrying amounts of the company’s contingent obligations related to merchant processing activities were immaterial 

custody indemnifications custody indemnifications are issued to guarantee that custody clients will be made whole in the event that a thirdparty subcustodian or depository institution fails to safeguard clients’ assets 

other guarantees and indemnifications 

credit card protection programs the company through its credit card business provides various cardholder protection programs on several of its card products including programs that provide insurance coverage for rental cars coverage for certain losses associated with purchased products price protection for certain purchases and protection for lost luggage these guarantees are not included in the table since the total outstanding amount of the guarantees and the company’s maximum exposure to loss cannot be quantified the protection is limited to certain types of purchases and certain types of losses and it is not possible to quantify the purchases that would qualify for these benefits at any given time the company assesses the probability and amount of its potential liability related to these programs based on the extent and nature of its historical loss experience at december 31 2011 and 2010 the actual and estimated losses incurred and the carrying value of the company’s obligations related to these programs were immaterial 

other representation and warranty indemnifications in the normal course of business the company provides standard representations and warranties to counterparties in contracts in connection with numerous transactions and also provides indemnifications including indemnifications that protect the counterparties to the contracts in the event that additional taxes are owed due either to a change in the tax law or an adverse interpretation of the tax law counterparties to these transactions provide the company with comparable indemnifications while such representations warranties and indemnifications are essential components of many contractual relationships they do not represent the underlying business purpose for the transactions the indemnification clauses are often standard contractual terms related to the company’s own performance under the terms of a contract and are entered into in the 

normal course of business based on an assessment that the risk of loss is remote often these clauses are intended to ensure that terms of a contract are met at inception no compensation is received for these standard representations and warranties and it is not possible to determine their fair value because they rarely if ever result in a payment in many cases there are no stated or notional amounts included in the indemnification clauses and the contingencies potentially triggering the obligation to indemnify have not occurred and are not expected to occur these indemnifications are not included in the tables above 

valuetransfer networks the company is a member of or shareholder in hundreds of valuetransfer networks vtns payment clearing and settlement systems as well as exchanges around the world as a condition of membership many of these vtns require that members stand ready to pay a pro rata share of the losses incurred by the organization due to another member’s default on its obligations the company’s potential obligations may be limited to its membership interests in the vtns contributions to the vtn’s funds or in limited cases the obligation may be unlimited the maximum exposure cannot be estimated as this would require an assessment of future claims that have not yet occurred we believe the risk of loss is remote given historical experience with the vtns accordingly the company’s participation in vtns is not reported in the company’s guarantees tables above and there are no amounts reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2011 or december 31 2010 for potential obligations that could arise from the company’s involvement with vtn associations 

longterm care insurance indemnification in the sale of an insurance subsidiary the company provided an indemnification to an insurance company for policyholder claims and other liabilities relating to a book of longterm care ltc business for the entire term of the ltc policies that is fully reinsured by another insurance company the reinsurer has funded two trusts with securities whose fair value approximately 44 billion at december 31 2011 and 36 billion at december 31 2010 is designed to cover the insurance company’s statutory liabilities for the ltc policies the assets in these trusts are evaluated and adjusted periodically to ensure that the fair value of the assets continues to cover the estimated statutory liabilities related to the ltc policies as those statutory liabilities change over time if the reinsurer fails to perform under the reinsurance agreement for any reason including insolvency and the assets in the two trusts are insufficient or unavailable to the ceding insurance company then citigroup must indemnify the ceding insurance company for any losses actually incurred in connection with the ltc policies since both events would have to occur before citi would become responsible for any 

payment to the ceding insurance company pursuant to its indemnification obligation and the likelihood of such events occurring is currently not probable there is no liability reflected in the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2011 related to this indemnification however citi continues to closely monitor its potential exposure under this indemnification obligation 

carrying value—guarantees and indemnifications at december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 the total carrying amounts of the liabilities related to the guarantees and indemnifications included in the tables above amounted to approximately 32 billion and 21 billion respectively the carrying value of derivative instruments is included in either trading liabilities or other liabilities  depending upon whether the derivative was entered into for trading or nontrading purposes the carrying value of financial and performance guarantees is included in other liabilities  for loans sold with recourse the carrying value of the liability is included in other liabilities  in addition at december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet include an allowance for credit losses of 1136 million and 1066 million respectively relating to letters of credit and unfunded lending commitments 

collateral cash collateral available to the company to reimburse losses realized under these guarantees and indemnifications amounted to 35 billion at december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 securities and other marketable assets held as collateral amounted to 65 billion and 41 billion at december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 respectively the majority of which collateral is held to reimburse losses realized under securities lending indemnifications additionally letters of credit in favor of the company held as collateral amounted to 15 billion and 20 billion at december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 respectively other property may also be available to the company to cover losses under certain guarantees and indemnifications however the value of such property has not been determined 

performance risk citi evaluates the performance risk of its guarantees based on the assigned referenced counterparty internal or external ratings where external ratings are used investmentgrade ratings are considered to be baabbb and above while anything below is considered noninvestment grade the citi internal ratings are in line with the related external rating system on certain underlying referenced credits or entities ratings are not available such referenced credits are included in the “not rated” category the maximum potential amount of the future payments related to guarantees and credit derivatives sold is determined to be the notional amount of these contracts which is the par amount of the assets guaranteed 

  presented in the tables below are the maximum potential amounts of future payments that are classified based upon internal and external credit ratings as of december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 as previously mentioned the determination of the maximum potential future payments is based on the notional amount of the guarantees without consideration of possible recoveries under recourse provisions or from collateral held or pledged such amounts bear no relationship to the anticipated losses if any on these guarantees

overview in addition to the matters described below in the ordinary course of business citigroup and its affiliates and subsidiaries and current and former officers directors and employees for purposes of this section sometimes collectively referred to as citigroup and related parties routinely are named as defendants in or as parties to various legal actions and proceedings certain of these actions and proceedings assert claims or seek relief in connection with alleged violations of consumer protection securities banking antifraud antitrust antimoney laundering employment and other statutory and common laws certain of these actual or threatened legal actions and proceedings include claims for substantial or indeterminate compensatory or punitive damages or for injunctive relief and in some instances seek recovery on a classwide basis   in the ordinary course of business citigroup and related parties also are subject to governmental and regulatory examinations informationgathering requests investigations and proceedings both formal and informal certain of which may result in adverse judgments settlements fines penalties disgorgement injunctions or other relief certain affiliates and subsidiaries of citigroup are banks registered brokerdealers futures commission merchants investment advisers or other regulated entities and in those capacities are subject to regulation by various us state and foreign securities banking commodity futures and other regulators in connection with formal and informal inquiries by these regulators citigroup and such affiliates and subsidiaries receive numerous requests subpoenas and orders seeking documents testimony and other information in connection with various aspects of their regulated activities   because of the global scope of citigroup’s operations and its presence in countries around the world citigroup and related parties are subject to litigation and governmental and regulatory examinations informationgathering requests investigations and proceedings both formal and informal in multiple jurisdictions with legal and regulatory regimes that may differ substantially and present substantially different risks from those citigroup and related parties are subject to in the united states in some instances citigroup and related parties may be involved in proceedings involving the same subject matter in multiple jurisdictions which may result in overlapping cumulative or inconsistent outcomes   citigroup seeks to resolve all litigation and regulatory matters in the manner management believes is in the best interests of citigroup and its shareholders and contests liability allegations of wrongdoing and where applicable the amount of damages or scope of any penalties or other relief sought as appropriate in each pending matter 

accounting and disclosure framework asc 450 formerly sfas 5 governs the disclosure and recognition of loss contingencies including potential losses from litigation and regulatory matters asc 450 defines a “loss contingency” as “an existing condition situation or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss to an entity that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur” it imposes different requirements for the recognition 

and disclosure of loss contingencies based on the likelihood of occurrence of the contingent future event or events it distinguishes among degrees of likelihood using the following three terms “probable” meaning that “the future event or events are likely to occur” “remote” meaning that “the chance of the future event or events occurring is slight” and “reasonably possible” meaning that “the chance of the future event or events occurring is more than remote but less than likely” these three terms are used below as defined in asc 450   accruals asc 450 requires accrual for a loss contingency when it is “probable that one or more future events will occur confirming the fact of loss” and “the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated” in accordance with asc 450 citigroup establishes accruals for all litigation and regulatory matters including matters disclosed herein when citigroup believes it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated when the reasonable estimate of the loss is within a range of amounts the minimum amount of the range is accrued unless some higher amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range once established accruals are adjusted from time to time as appropriate in light of additional information the amount of loss ultimately incurred in relation to those matters may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts accrued for those matters   disclosure asc 450 requires disclosure of a loss contingency if “there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may have been incurred” and there is no accrual for the loss because the conditions described above are not met or an exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount accrued in accordance with asc 450 if citigroup has not accrued for a matter because citigroup believes that a loss is reasonably possible but not probable or that a loss is probable but not reasonably estimable and the matter therefore does not meet the criteria for accrual and the reasonably possible loss is material it discloses the loss contingency in addition citigroup discloses matters for which it has accrued if it believes an exposure to material loss exists in excess of the amount accrued in accordance with asc 450 citigroup’s disclosure includes an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss for those matters as to which an estimate can be made asc 450 does not require disclosure of an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss where an estimate cannot be made neither accrual nor disclosure is required for losses that are deemed remote   inherent uncertainty of the matters disclosed certain of the matters disclosed below involve claims for substantial or indeterminate damages the claims asserted in these matters typically are broad often spanning a multiyear period and sometimes a wide range of business activities and the plaintiffs’ or claimants’ alleged damages frequently are not quantified or factually supported in the complaint or statement of claim as a result citigroup is often unable to estimate the loss in such matters even if it believes that a loss is probable or reasonably possible until developments in the case have yielded additional information sufficient to support a quantitative assessment of the range of reasonably possible loss such developments may include among other things discovery from adverse parties or third parties rulings by the court on key issues analysis by 

retained experts and engagement in settlement negotiations depending on a range of factors such as the complexity of the facts the novelty of the legal theories the pace of discovery the court’s scheduling order the timing of court decisions and the adverse party’s willingness to negotiate in good faith toward a resolution it may be months or years after the filing of a case before an estimate of the range of reasonably possible loss can be made   matters as to which an estimate can be made for some of the matters disclosed below citigroup is currently able to estimate a reasonably possible loss or range of loss in excess of amounts accrued if any for some of the matters included within this estimation an accrual has been made because a loss is believed to be both probable and reasonably estimable but an exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount accrued in these cases the estimate reflects the reasonably possible range of loss in excess of the accrued amount for other matters included within this estimation no accrual has been made because a loss although estimable is believed to be reasonably possible but not probable in these cases the estimate reflects the reasonably possible loss or range of loss as of december 31 2011 citigroup estimates that the reasonably possible unaccrued loss in future periods for these matters ranges up to approximately 4 billion in the aggregate   these estimates are based on currently available information as available information changes the matters for which citigroup is able to estimate will change and the estimates themselves will change in addition while many estimates presented in financial statements and other financial disclosure involve significant judgment and may be subject to significant uncertainty estimates of the range of reasonably possible loss arising from litigation and regulatory proceedings are subject to particular uncertainties for example at the time of making an estimate citigroup may have only preliminary incomplete or inaccurate information about the facts underlying the claim its assumptions about the future rulings of the court or other tribunal on significant issues or the behavior and incentives of adverse parties or regulators may prove to be wrong and the outcomes it is attempting to predict are often not amenable to the use of statistical or other quantitative analytical tools in addition from time to time an outcome may occur that citigroup had not accounted for in its estimate because it had deemed such an outcome to be remote for all these reasons the amount of loss in excess of accruals ultimately incurred for the matters as to which an estimate has been made could be substantially higher or lower than the range of loss included in the estimate   matters as to which an estimate cannot be made for other matters disclosed below citigroup is not currently able to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss many of these matters remain in very preliminary stages even in some cases where a substantial period of time has passed since the commencement of the matter with few or no substantive legal decisions by the court or tribunal defining the scope of the claims the class if any or the potentially available damages and fact discovery is still in progress or has not yet begun in many of these matters citigroup has not yet answered the complaint or statement of claim or asserted its defenses nor has it engaged in any negotiations with the adverse party whether a regulator or a private party for all these reasons citigroup cannot at this time estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss if any for these matters 

  opinion of management as to eventual outcome subject to the foregoing it is the opinion of citigroup’s management based on current knowledge and after taking into account its current legal accruals that the eventual outcome of all matters described in this note would not be likely to have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition of citigroup nonetheless given the substantial or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and the inherent unpredictability of such matters an adverse outcome in certain of these matters could from time to time have a material adverse effect on citigroup’s consolidated results of operations or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods

  the national mortgage settlement also provides for mortgage servicing standards in addition to those previously agreed in consent orders dated april 13 2011 with the federal reserve board and the office of comptroller of the currency while citigroup expects to incur additional operating expenses in implementing these standards it does not currently expect that the impact of these expenses will be material   citigroup is receiving legal releases in connection with the national mortgage settlement these releases will address a broad range of but not all potential claims related to mortgage servicing and origination citigroup will not receive releases related to securitizations or whole loan sales nor will it receive releases from criminal tax environmental and certain other categories of liability   in conjunction with the national mortgage settlement citigroup and related parties also entered into a settlement with the united states attorney’s office for the southern district of new york of a “qui tam” action this action alleged that as a participant in the direct endorsement lender program citimortgage had certified to the united states department of housing and urban development hud and the federal housing administration fha that certain loans were eligible for fha insurance when in fact they were not the settlement releases citigroup from claims arising out of its acts or omissions relating to the origination underwriting or endorsement of all fhainsured loans prior to the effective date of the settlement under the settlement citigroup will pay the united states 1583 million for which citigroup had fully provided as of december 31 2011 see note 30 to the consolidated financial statements citimortgage will continue to participate in the direct endorsement lender program additional information relating to this action is publicly available in court filings under the docket number 11 civ 5423 sdny marrero j   federal and state regulators have served subpoenas or otherwise requested information concerning a variety of aspects of citigroup’s mortgage origination and mortgage servicing practices including with respect to ancillary insurance products or practices the subjects of such inquiries have included among other things citigroup’s compliance with the scra and analogous state statutes many but not all of these inquiries are within the scope of the claims released in the national mortgage settlement in some instances citigroup is also a defendant in purported class actions “qui tam” actions or other actions addressing the same or similar subject matters including the scra such actions by private litigants or counties and municipalities are not released in the national mortgage settlement   federal and state regulators including the sec also have served subpoenas or otherwise requested information related to citigroup’s issuing sponsoring or underwriting of mbs these inquiries include a subpoena from the civil division of the department of justice that citigroup received on january 27 2012

customers in citigroup’s judgment no material part of citigroup’s business depends upon a single customer or group of customers the loss of which would have a materially adverse effect on citi and no one customer or group of affiliated customers accounts for at least 10 of citigroup’s consolidated revenues 

competition the financial services industry including each of citigroup’s businesses is highly competitive citigroup’s competitors include a variety of other financial services and advisory companies such as banks thrifts credit unions credit card issuers mortgage banking companies trust companies investment banking companies brokerage firms investment advisory companies hedge funds private equity funds securities processing companies mutual fund companies insurance companies automobile financing companies and internetbased financial services companies citigroup competes for clients and capital including deposits and funding in the short and longterm debt markets with some of these competitors globally and with others on a regional or product basis citigroup’s competitive position depends on many factors including the value of citi’s brand name reputation the types of clients and geographies served the quality range performance innovation and pricing of products and services the effectiveness of and access to distribution channels technology advances customer service and convenience effectiveness of transaction execution interest rates and lending limits regulatory constraints and the effectiveness of sales promotion efforts citigroup’s ability to compete effectively also depends upon its ability to attract new employees and retain and motivate existing employees while managing compensation and other costs see “risk factors—regulatory risks” above   in recent years citigroup has experienced intense price competition in some of its businesses for example the increased pressure on trading commissions from growing direct access to automated electronic markets 

may continue to impact securities and banking  and technological advances that enable more companies to provide funds transfers may diminish the importance of global consumer banking’s role as a financial intermediary   there has been substantial consolidation among companies in the financial services industry particularly as a result of the financial crisis through mergers acquisitions and bankruptcies this consolidation may produce larger better capitalized and more geographically diverse competitors able to offer a wider array of products and services at more competitive prices around the world in certain geographic regions including “emerging markets” our competitors may have a stronger local presence longer operating histories and more established relationships with clients and regulators

to further encourage employee stock ownership the companys eligible employees participate in wealthbuilder citibuilder or the citigroup ownership program options granted under the wealthbuilder and the citigroup ownership program vest over a fiveyear period whereas options granted under the citibuilder program vest after five years these options do not have a reload feature beginning in 2003 new options are no longer being granted under these plans

 1 includes 294 million options in 2002 that were exchanged for tpc options the following table summarizes the information about stock options outstanding under citigroup stock option plans at december 31 2003 

 stock award programs 

the company primarily through its capital accumulation program cap issues shares of citigroup common stock in the form of restricted or deferred stock to participating officers and employees the restricted or deferred stock generally vests after a two or threeyear vesting period during which time the stock cannot be sold or transferred by the participant and is subject to total or partial cancellation if the participants employment is terminated cap participants may elect to receive part of their awards in cap stock and part in stock options the figures in the two previous tables include options granted under cap unearned compensation expense associated with the stock grants represents the market value of citigroup common stock at the date of grant and is recognized as a charge to income ratably over the vesting period 

in 2003 special equity awards were issued to certain employees in the global corporate and investment bank and citigroup international businesses the awards are not discounted and vest over a threeyear term beginning on july 12 2003 with onesixth of the award vesting every six months until the shares vest a recipient may not transfer the shares after they vest the shares become freely transferable subject to the stock ownership commitment from the date of award the recipient can direct the vote on the shares and receive regular dividends 

during 2003 citigroup granted shares under the citigroup ownership program cop to eligible employees this program replaces the wealthbuilder citibuilder and citigroup ownership stock option programs employees are issued either restricted or deferred shares of citigroup common stock which vest after three years during which time the stock cannot be sold or transferred by the participant unearned compensation expense associated with the stock grants represents the market value of citigroup common stock at the date of grant and is recognized as a charge to income ratably over the vesting period 

information with respect to stock awards is as follows 

 stock purchase program 

stock purchase program offerings which are administered under the citigroup 2003 stock purchase program and the citigroup 2000 stock purchase plan allow eligible employees of citigroup to enter into fixed subscription agreements to purchase shares in the future at the market value on the date of the agreements subject to certain limits enrolled employees are permitted to make one purchase prior to the expiration date the purchase price of the shares is paid with accumulated payroll deductions plus interest shares of citigroups common stock delivered under the stock purchase program may be sourced from authorized and unissued or treasury shares the offering under the citigroup 2003 stock purchase program was made on june 15 2003 the program ends in july 2005 the original offering under the citigroup stock purchase program was in august 2000 in 2001 three additional offerings were made to new employees in march july and november 2001 in february 2002 an additional offering was made to new employees 

following is the share activity under the stock purchase program the fixed price for the june 2003 offering was 4410 the fixed price for the citigroup 2000 stock purchase plan offering in august 2000 was 4936 per share the fixed prices for the offerings made in march july and november 2001 were 4195 4683 and 4245 respectively the fixed price for the offering made in february 2002 was 4220 

 1 2002 activity represents shares canceled or expired due to the grant price exceeding the market price pro forma impact of sfas 123 

prior to january 1 2003 citigroup applied apb 25 in accounting for its stockbased compensation plans under apb 25 there is generally no charge to earnings for employee stock option awards because the options granted under these plans have an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the grant date alternatively sfas 123 allows companies to recognize compensation expense over the related service period based on the grantdate fair value of the stock award refer to note 1 for a further description of these accounting standards and a presentation of the effect on net income and earnings per share had the company applied sfas 123 in accounting for all of the companys stock option plans the pro forma adjustments in that table relate to stock options granted from 1995 through 2002 for which a fair value on the date of grant was determined using a blackscholes option pricing model in accordance with sfas 123 no effect has been given to options granted prior to 1995 the fair values of stockbased awards are based on assumptions that were determined at the grant date 

fair value assumptions 

sfas 123 requires that reload options be treated as separate grants from the related original grants under the companys reload program upon exercise of an option employees use previously owned shares to pay the exercise price and surrender shares otherwise to be received for related tax withholding and receive a reload option covering the same number of shares used for such purposes reload options vest at the end of a sixmonth period reload options are intended to encourage employees to exercise options at an earlier date and to retain the shares so acquired in furtherance of the companys longstanding policy of encouraging increased employee stock ownership the result of this program is that employees generally will exercise options as soon as they are able and therefore these options have shorter expected lives shorter option lives result in lower valuations using a blackscholes option model however such values are expensed more quickly due to the shorter vesting period of reload options in addition since reload options are treated as separate grants the existence of the reload feature results in a greater number of options being valued 

shares received through option exercises under the reload program as well as certain other options granted are subject to restrictions on sale discounts have been applied to the fair value of options granted to reflect these sale restrictions 

additional valuation and related assumption information for citigroup option plans including the citigroup 2003 stock purchase program is presented below

 1 weighted average rates for the us plans equals the stated rates 2 excluding highly inflationary countries assumed health care cost trend rates were as follows 

 a one percentagepoint change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects 

 108 

plan assets 

citigroup determines its assumptions for the expected rate of return on plan assets for its us plans using a building block approach which focuses on ranges of anticipated rates of return for each asset class a weighted range of nominal rates is then determined based on target allocations for each asset class citigroup considers the expected rate of return to be a longerterm assessment of return expectations and does not anticipate changing this assumption annually unless there are significant changes in economic conditions a similar approach has been taken in selecting the expected rates of return for citigroups foreign plans the expected rate of return for each plan is based upon its expected asset allocation market performance over a number of earlier years is evaluated covering a wide range of economic conditions to determine whether there are sound reasons for projecting forward any past trends 

the expected longterm rates of return on assets used in determining the companys pension expense and postretirement expense are shown below 

 1 weighted average rates for the us plans equals the stated rates citigroups pension and postretirement plan asset allocation for the us plans at the end of 2003 and 2002 and the target allocation for 2004 by asset category based on asset fair values are as follows 

 equity securities in the us pension plans include citigroup common stock with a fair value of 608 million or 645 of plan assets and 594 million or 787 of plan assets at the end of 2003 and 2002 respectively subsequent to december 31 2003 the citigroup pension plan sold approximately 500 million of citigroup common stock 

affiliated and thirdparty investment managers manage citigroups pension plan assets assets are rebalanced as the company deems appropriate citigroups investment strategy with respect to its pension assets is to maintain a globally diversified investment portfolio across several asset classes targeting an annual rate of return of 8 while ensuring that the accumulated benefit obligation is fully funded 

citigroups pension and postretirement plans weighted average asset allocations for the nonus plans and the actual ranges at the end of 2003 and 2002 and the weighted average target allocations for 2004 by asset category based on asset fair values are as follows 

  109 

citigroups global pension and postretirement funds investment strategies are to invest in a prudent manner for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits to participants the investment strategies are targeted to produce a total return that when combined with citigroups contributions to the funds will maintain the funds ability to meet all required benefit obligations risk is controlled through diversification of asset types and investments in domestic and international equities fixed income securities and cash the target asset allocation in most locations is 50 equities and 50 debt securities these allocations may vary by geographic region and country depending on the nature of applicable obligations and various other regional considerations the wide variation in the actual range of plan asset allocations for the funded nonus plans is a result of differing local economic conditions for example in certain countries local law requires that all pension plan assets must be invested in fixed income investments or in government funds or in local country securities 

contributions 

citigroups funding policy for us plans and nonus plans is generally to fund to the amounts of accumulated benefit obligations for the us plans the company may increase its contributions above the minimum required contribution under erisa if appropriate to its tax and cash position and the plans funded position at december 31 2003 there were no minimum required contributions and no discretionary or noncash contributions are currently planned for the nonus plans discretionary contributions in 2004 are anticipated to be approximately 129 million these estimates are subject to change since contribution decisions are affected by various factors such as market performance regulatory requirements and managements ability to change funding policy 

citigroup 401k 

under the citigroup 401k plan eligible employees receive matching contributions of up to 3 of compensation subject to an annual maximum of 1500 invested in the citigroup common stock fund the pretax expense associated with this plan amounted to approximately 65 million in 2003 57 million in 2002 and 49 million in 2001 

25 derivatives and other activities 

citigroup enters into derivative and foreign exchange futures forwards options and swaps which enable customers to transfer modify or reduce their interest rate foreign exchange and other market risks and also trades these products for its own account in addition citigroup uses derivatives and other instruments primarily interest rate products as an enduser in connection with its risk management activities derivatives are used to manage interest rate risk relating to specific groups of onbalance sheet assets and liabilities including investments commercial and consumer loans deposit liabilities longterm debt and other interestsensitive assets and liabilities as well as credit card securitizations redemptions and sales in addition foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge nonus dollar denominated debt net capital exposures and foreign exchange transactions 

a derivative must be highly effective in accomplishing the hedge objective of offsetting either changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item for the risk being hedged any ineffectiveness present in the hedge relationship is recognized in current earnings the assessment of effectiveness excludes the changes in the value of the hedged item which are unrelated to the risks being hedged similarly the assessment of effectiveness may exclude changes in the fair value of a derivative related to time value which if excluded are recognized in current earnings 

the following table summarizes certain information related to the companys hedging activities for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 

 for cash flow hedges any changes in the fair value of the enduser derivative remain in accumulated other changes in equity from nonowner sources on the consolidated balance sheet and are generally included in earnings of future periods when earnings are also affected by the variability of the hedged cash flow the net gains associated with cash flow hedges expected to be reclassified from accumulated other changes in equity from nonowner sources within twelve months of december 31 2003 are 651 million 

the accumulated other changes in equity from nonowner sources from cash flow hedges for 2003 2002 and 2001 can be summarized as follows aftertax 

 1 the 2001 amount results from the cumulative effect of account change for cash flow hedges the company enters into various types of derivative transactions in the course of its trading and nontrading activities futures and forward contracts are commitments to buy or sell at a future date a financial instrument commodity or currency at a contracted price and may be settled in cash or through delivery swap contracts are commitments to settle in cash at a future date or dates which may range from a few days to a number of years based on differentials between specified financial indices as applied to a notional principal amount option contracts give the purchaser for a fee the right but not the obligation to buy or sell within a limited time a financial instrument or currency at a contracted price that may also be settled in cash based on differentials between specified indices 

citigroup also sells various financial instruments that have not been purchased short sales in order to sell securities short the securities are borrowed or received as collateral in conjunction with shortterm financing agreements and at a later date must be delivered ie replaced with like or substantially the same financial instruments or commodities to the parties from which they were originally borrowed 

derivatives and short sales may expose citigroup to market risk or credit risk in excess of the amounts recorded on the consolidated balance sheet market risk on a derivative short sale or foreign exchange product is the exposure created by potential fluctuations in interest rates foreign exchange rates and other values and is a function of the type of product the volume of transactions the tenor and terms of the agreement and the underlying volatility credit risk is the exposure to loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the transaction and if the value of collateral held if any was not adequate to cover such losses the recognition in earnings of unrealized gains on these transactions is subject to managements assessment as to collectibility liquidity risk is the potential exposure that arises when the size of the derivative position may not be able to be rapidly adjusted in times of high volatility and financial stress at a reasonable cost 

26 concentrations of credit risk 

concentrations of credit risk exist when changes in economic industry or geographic factors similarly affect groups of counterparties whose aggregate credit exposure is material in relation to citigroups total credit exposure although citigroups portfolio of financial instruments is broadly diversified along industry product and geographic lines material transactions are completed with other financial institutions particularly in the securities trading derivative and foreign exchange businesses 

in connection with the companys efforts to maintain a diversified portfolio the company limits its exposure to any one geographic region country or individual creditor and monitors this exposure on a continuous basis at december 31 2003 citigroups most significant concentration of credit risk was with the us government and its agencies the companys exposure which primarily results from trading assets and investment securities positions in instruments issued by the us government and its agencies amounted 

to 587 billion and 407 billion at december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively after the us government the next largest exposure the company has is to the mexican government and its agencies which are rated investment grade by both moodys and sp the companys exposure amounted to 219 billion and 250 billion at december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively and is comprised of investment securities loans and trading assets 

27 fair value of financial instruments 

estimated fair value of financial instruments 

the table below presents the carrying value and fair value of citigroups financial instruments as defined in accordance with applicable requirements accordingly as required the disclosures exclude leases affiliate investments and pension and benefit obligations contractholder funds amounts exclude certain insurance contracts also as required the disclosures exclude the effect of taxes any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the entire holdings of a particular instrument excess fair value associated with deposits with no fixed maturity and other expenses that would be incurred in a market transaction in addition the table excludes the values of nonfinancial assets and liabilities as well as a wide range of franchise relationship and intangible values which are integral to a full assessment of citigroups financial position and the value of its net assets 

the fair value represents managements best estimates based on a range of methodologies and assumptions the carrying value of shortterm financial instruments as well as receivables and payables arising in the ordinary course of business approximates fair value because of the relatively short period of time between their origination and expected realization quoted market prices are used for most investments and for both trading and enduser derivatives as well as for liabilities such as longterm debt with quoted prices for performing loans contractual cash flows are discounted at quoted secondary market rates or estimated market rates if available otherwise sales of comparable loan portfolios or current market origination rates for loans with similar terms and risk characteristics are used for loans with doubt as to collectibility expected cash flows are discounted using an appropriate rate considering the time of collection and the premium for the uncertainty of the flows the value of collateral is also considered for liabilities such as longterm debt without quoted market prices market borrowing rates of interest are used to discount contractual cash flows 

 1 the carrying value of loans is net of the allowance for credit losses and also excludes 156 billion and 186 billion of lease finance receivables in 2003 and 2002 respectively 2 includes cash and due from banks deposits at interest with banks brokerage receivables reinsurance recoverables and separate and variable accounts for which the carrying value is a reasonable estimate of fair value and the carrying value and estimated fair value of financial instruments included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet 3 includes brokerage payables separate and variable accounts investment banking and brokerage borrowings shortterm borrowings for which the carrying value is a reasonable estimate of fair value and the carrying value and estimated fair value of financial instruments included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet fair values vary from period to period based on changes in a wide range of factors including interest rates credit quality and market perceptions of value and as existing assets and liabilities run off and new transactions are entered into 

the estimated fair values of loans reflect changes in credit status since the loans were made changes in interest rates in the case of fixedrate loans and premium values at origination of certain loans the estimated fair values of citigroups loans in the aggregate exceeded in carrying values reduced by the allowance for credit losses by 200 billion in 2003 and 192 billion in 2002 within these totals estimated fair values exceeded carrying values for consumer loans net of the allowance by 163 billion an increase of 19 billion from 2002 and for corporate loans net of the allowance by 37 billion which was a decrease of 11 billion from 2002 the excess of the estimated fair value of loans over their carrying value reflects the decline in market interest rates since many of the loans were issued

the company provides a variety of guarantees and indemnifications to citigroup customers to enhance their credit standing and enable them to complete a wide variety of business transactions the table on page 113 summarizes at december 31 2003 all of the companys guarantees and indemnifications where we believe the guarantees and indemnifications are related to an asset liability or equity security of the guaranteed parties at the inception of the contract the maximum potential amount of future payments represents the notional amounts that could be lost under the guarantees and indemnifications if there were a total default by the guaranteed parties without consideration of possible recoveries under recourse provisions or from collateral held or pledged such amounts bear no relationship to the anticipated losses on these guarantees and indemnifications and greatly exceed anticipated losses 

the following tables present information about the companys guarantees at december 31 2003 and 2002 

   

 1 the carrying values of securities lending indemnifications credit card merchant processing custody indemnifications market value guarantees and residual value guarantees are not material as the company has determined that the amount and probability of potential liabilities arising from these guarantees are not significant and the carrying amount of the companys obligations under these guarantees is immaterial 2 reclassified to conform to the 2003 presentation financial standby letters of credit include guarantees of payment of insurance premiums and reinsurance risks that support industrial revenue bond underwriting and settlement of payment obligations in clearing houses and that support options and purchases of securities or in lieu of escrow deposit accounts financial standbys also backstop loans credit facilities promissory notes and trade acceptances performance guarantees and letters of credit are issued to guarantee a customers tender bid on a construction or systems installation project or to guarantee completion of such projects in accordance with contract terms they are also issued to support a customers obligation to supply specified products commodities or maintenance or warranty services to a third party derivative instruments include credit default swaps total return swaps written foreign exchange options written put options and written equity warrants guarantees of collection of contractual cash flows protect investors in credit card receivables securitization trusts from loss of interest relating to insufficient collections on the underlying receivables in the trusts loans sold with recourse represent the companys obligations to reimburse the buyers for loan losses under certain circumstances contingent payments in a business disposition relates to the companys obligation to make certain payments to tpc following the distribution of this business to shareholders in 2002 see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about discontinued operations securities lending indemnifications are issued to guarantee that a security lending customer will be made whole in the event that the security borrower does not return the security subject to the lending agreement and collateral held is insufficient to cover the market value of the security credit card merchant processing guarantees represent the companys obligations in connection with the processing of credit card transactions on behalf of merchants custody indemnifications are issued to guarantee that custody clients will be made whole in the event that a thirdparty subcustodian fails to safeguard clients assets market value guarantees are issued to guarantee return of principal invested to fund investors residual value guarantees provide that the guarantor will pay the difference between the fair value of the guaranteed property or equipment and the value specified in the contract to the guarantor at the termination or renewal date of an operating lease 

at december 31 2003 and 2002 the companys maximum potential amount of future payments under these guarantees was approximately 2678 billion and 1898 billion respectively for this purpose the maximum potential amount of future payments is considered to be the notional amounts of letters of credit guarantees written credit default swaps written total return swaps indemnifications and recourse provisions of loans sold with recourse and the fair values of foreign exchange options and other written put options warrants caps and floors 

citigroups primary credit card business is the issuance of credit cards to individuals the company also provides processing services to various merchants processing credit card transactions on their behalf 

and managing the merchants cash flow related to their credit card activity in connection with these services a contingent liability arises in the event of a billing dispute between the merchant and a cardholder that is ultimately resolved in the cardholders favor and generally extends between three and six months after the date the transaction is processed or the receipt of the product or service depending on industry practice or statutory requirements in this situation the transaction is charged back to the merchant and the disputed amount is credited or otherwise refunded to the cardholder if the company is unable to collect this amount from the merchant it bears the loss for the amount of the refund paid to the cardholder the risk of loss is mitigated as the cash flows between the company and the merchant are settled on a net basis and the company has the right to offset any payments with cash flows otherwise due to the merchant to further mitigate this risk citigroup may require the merchant to make an escrow deposit delay settlement include event triggers to provide the company with more financial and operational control in the event of the financial deterioration of the merchant or require various credit enhancements including letters of credit and bank guarantees at december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively the company held as collateral approximately 61 million and 31 million respectively of merchant escrow deposits and also had 109 million and 96 million respectively payable to merchants which the company has the right to set off against amounts due from the individual merchants 

the companys maximum potential liability for this contingent merchant processing liability is estimated to be the total volume of credit card transactions that meet the associations requirements to be valid chargeback transactions at any given time at december 31 2003 and 2002 this maximum potential exposure was estimated to be 226 billion and 154 billion respectively however the company believes that the maximum exposure is not representative of the actual potential loss exposure based on the companys historical experience in most cases this contingent liability is unlikely to arise as most products and services are delivered when purchased and amounts are refunded when items are returned to merchants the company assesses the probability and amount of its liability related to merchant processing based on the extent and nature of unresolved chargebacks and its historical loss experience at december 31 2003 the estimated losses incurred and the carrying amount of the companys obligations related to merchant processing activities are immaterial 

in addition the company through its credit card business provides various cardholder protection programs on several of its card products including programs that provide insurance coverage for rental cars coverage for certain losses associated with purchased products price protection for certain purchases and protection for lost luggage these guarantees are not included in the table above since the total outstanding amount of the guarantees and the companys maximum exposure to loss cannot be quantified the protection is limited to certain types of purchases and certain types of losses and it is not possible to quantify the purchases that would qualify for these benefits at any given time actual losses related to these programs were not material during 2003 the company assesses the probability and amount of its potential liability related to these programs based on the extent and nature of its historical loss experience at december 31 2003 the estimated losses incurred and the carrying value of the companys obligations related to these programs are immaterial 

in the normal course of business the company provides standard representations and warranties to counterparties in contracts in connection with numerous transactions and also provides indemnifications that protect the counterparties to the contracts in the event that additional taxes are owed due either to a change in the tax law or an adverse interpretation of the tax law counterparties to these transactions provide the company with comparable indemnifications while such representations warranties and tax indemnifications are essential components of many contractual relationships they do not represent the underlying business purpose for the transactions the indemnification clauses are often standard contractual terms related to the companys own performance under the terms of a contract and are entered into in the normal course of business based on an assessment that the risk of loss is remote often these clauses are intended to ensure that terms of a contract are met at inception for example that loans transferred to a counterparty in a sales transaction did in fact meet the conditions specified in the contract at the transfer date no compensation is received for these standard representations and warranties and it is not possible to determine their fair value because they rarely if ever result in a payment in many cases there are no stated or notional amounts included in the indemnification clauses and the contingencies potentially triggering the obligation to indemnify have not occurred and are not expected to occur there are no amounts reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2003 or 2002 related to these indemnifications and they are not included in the table above 

in addition the company is a member of or shareholder in hundreds of value transfer networks vtns payment clearing and settlement systems as well as securities exchanges around the world as a condition of membership many of these vtns require that members stand ready to backstop the net effect on the vtns of a members default on its obligations the companys potential obligations as a shareholder or member of vtn associations are excluded from the scope of fin 45 since the shareholders and members represent subordinated classes of investors in the vtns accordingly the companys participation in vtns is not reported in the table above and there are no amounts reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2003 or 2002 for potential obligations that could arise from the companys involvement with vtn associations 

at december 31 2003 and 2002 the carrying amounts of the liabilities related to the guarantees and indemnifications included in the table above amounted to approximately 132 billion and 106 billion the carrying value of derivative instruments is included in either trading liabilities or other liabilities depending upon whether the derivative was entered into for trading or nontrading purposes the carrying value of financial and performance guarantees is included in other liabilities the carrying value of the guarantees of contractual cash flows are offset against the receivables from the credit card trusts for loans sold with recourse the carrying value of the liability is included in other liabilities in addition at december 31 2003 and 2002 other liabilities includes an allowance for credit losses of 600 million and 567 million respectively relating to letters of credit and unfunded lending commitments 

in addition to the collateral available in respect of the credit card merchant processing contingent liability discussed above the company has collateral available to reimburse potential losses on its other guarantees cash collateral available to the company to reimburse losses realized under these guarantees and indemnifications amounted to 383 billion and 319 billion at december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively securities and other marketable assets held as collateral amounted to 294 billion and 188 billion and letters of credit in favor of the company held as collateral amounted to 931 million and 834 million at december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively other property may also be available to the company to cover losses under certain guarantees and indemnifications however the value of such property has not been determined

various put options were written during 2000 and 1999 which require citigroup to purchase upon request of the holders securities issued in certain securitization transactions in order to broaden the investor base and improve execution in connection with the securitizations the aggregate amortized amount of these options was approximately 08 billion at december 31 2002 the company had recorded liabilities totaling approximately 6 million at december 31 2002 in connection with these options subsequent to their initial issuance such options are markedtomarket with the fluctuation being reflected on the consolidated statement of income during the first quarter of 2003 citigroup purchased all remaining outstanding class a certificates related to the securitization covered by the put option this effectively removed the remaining put option

the activities of us bank holding companies are generally limited to the business of banking managing or controlling banks and other activities that the frb determines to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto in addition under the grammleachbliley act the glb act bank holding companies such as the company all of whose controlled depository institutions are well capitalized and well managed as defined in federal reserve regulation y and which obtain satisfactory community reinvestment act ratings have the ability to declare themselves to be financial holding companies and engage in a broader spectrum of activities including insurance underwriting and brokerage including annuities and underwriting and dealing securities the company has declared itself to be a financial holding company financial holding companies that do not continue to meet all of the requirements for such status will depending on which requirement they fail to meet face not being able to undertake new activities or acquisitions that are financial in nature or losing their ability to continue those activities that are not generally permissible for bank holding companies

outside the us subject to certain requirements for prior frb consent or notice the company may acquire banks and citibank may establish branches subject to local laws and to us laws prohibiting companies from doing business in certain countries 

the companys earnings and activities are affected by legislation by actions of its regulators and by local legislative and administrative bodies and decisions of courts in the foreign and domestic jurisdictions in which the company and its subsidiaries conduct business for example these include limitations on the ability of certain subsidiaries to pay dividends to their intermediate holding companies and on the abilities of those holding companies to pay dividends to the company see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements it is the policy of the frb that bank holding companies should pay cash dividends on common stock only out of income available over the past year and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organizations expected future needs and financial condition the policy provides that bank holding companies should not maintain a level of cash dividends that undermines the bank holding companys ability to serve as a source of strength to its banking subsidiaries 

various federal and state statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends that subsidiary banks and savings associations can pay to their holding companies without regulatory approval in addition to these explicit limitations the federal regulatory agencies are authorized to prohibit a banking subsidiary or bank holding company from engaging in an unsafe or unsound banking practice depending upon the circumstances the agencies could take the position that paying a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice
