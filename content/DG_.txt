​ 

covid19 pandemic 

​ 

throughout 2020 and 2021 the covid19 coronavirus pandemic resulted in widespread and continuing impacts on the global economy and affected our business as well as our customers suppliers and other business partners in march 2020 we began seeing heightened demand from customers particularly for consumable products such as paper food and cleaning products shortly thereafter we also saw a significant increase in demand for many nonconsumable products resulting in a significant overall sales mix shift into nonconsumable categories in 2020 overall the mix of consumables to nonconsumables sales in 2021 remained relatively consistent with 2020 since 2020 we also have seen a shift in consumer shopping behavior towards trip consolidation along with an increase in average transaction amounts in 2020 we incurred significant expense related to the pandemic including appreciation bonuses for retail distribution and transportation employees and health and safety measures although some of these expenses continued in 2021 they were not as significant as in 2020 we expect to continue to be affected although the extent and duration are unknown by the covid19 pandemic and its effects on the economy including governmental response thereto including its impact on the global supply chain and increased product distribution transportation and other costs 

​ 

our business model 

​ 

our long history of profitable growth is founded on a commitment to a relatively simple business model providing a broad base of customers with their basic everyday and household needs supplemented with a variety of general merchandise items at everyday low prices in conveniently located smallbox stores we continually evaluate the needs and demands of our customers and modify our merchandise selections and pricing accordingly while remaining focused on increasing profitability cash generation and returns for our shareholders

​ 

our longterm operating priorities are 1 driving profitable sales growth 2 capturing growth opportunities 3 enhancing our position as a lowcost operator and 4 investing in our diverse teams through development empowerment and inclusion  for more information on these operating priorities see the “executive overview” section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in part ii item 7 of this report 

​ 

from 1990 through 2020 we achieved 31 consecutive years of positive samestore sales growth as a result of the unusually high sales results we experienced in 2020 we did not achieve positive samestore sales growth in 2021 notwithstanding the unusual circumstances of 2020 and 2021 we believe that this consistent growth over many years which has taken place in a variety of economic conditions is a result of our compelling value and convenience proposition although no assurances can be given that we will achieve positive samestore sales growth in any given year 

​ 

compelling value and convenience proposition our ability to deliver highly competitive prices in convenient locations and our easy “in and out” shopping format create a compelling shopping experience that we believe distinguishes us from other discount retailers as well as convenience drug grocery online and mass merchant retailers our slogan “save time save money every day” ® summarizes our appeal to customers we believe our ability to effectively deliver both value and convenience allows us to succeed in small markets with limited shopping alternatives as well as in larger and more competitive markets our value and convenience proposition is evidenced by the following attributes of our business model

​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

substantial growth opportunities we believe we have substantial longterm growth potential in the us and we have identified significant opportunities to add new stores in both existing and new markets which include our new popshelf concept in addition we have opportunities to relocate or remodel locations within our existing store base to better serve our customers our attractive store economics including a relatively low initial investment and simple lowcost operating model and our variety of store formats have allowed us to grow our store base to current levels and provide us significant opportunities to continue our profitable store growth strategy 

​ 

our merchandise 

​ 

we offer a focused assortment of everyday necessities which we believe helps to drive frequent customer visits and key items in a broad range of general merchandise categories our product assortment provides the opportunity for our customers to address most of their basic shopping needs with one trip we offer a wide selection of nationally advertised brands from leading manufacturers additionally our private brand products offer even greater value with options to purchase both products that are of comparable quality to national brands as well as opening price point items each at substantial discounts to the national brands

​ 

consumables is our largest merchandise category and includes paper and cleaning products such as paper towels bath tissue paper dinnerware trash and storage bags disinfectants and laundry packaged food such as 

cereals pasta canned soups fruits and vegetables condiments spices sugar and flour perishables such as milk eggs bread refrigerated and frozen food beer and wine snacks such as candy cookies crackers salty snacks and carbonated beverages health and beauty such as overthecounter medicines and personal care products including soap body wash shampoo cosmetics dental hygiene and foot care products pet such as pet supplies and pet food and tobacco products

​ 

the percentage of net sales of each of our four categories of merchandise for the fiscal years indicated below was as follows

​ 

 ​ 

our seasonal and home products categories typically account for the highest gross profit margins and the consumables category typically accounts for the lowest gross profit margin

​ 

the dollar general store 

​ 

the typical dollar general store is operated by a store manager one or more assistant store managers and three or more sales associates our stores generally feature a lowcost no frills building with limited maintenance capital low operating costs and a focused merchandise offering within a broad range of categories allowing us to deliver low retail prices while generating strong cash flows and capital investment returns our stores currently average approximately 7400 square feet of selling space and approximately 75 of our stores are located in towns of 20000 or fewer people beginning in 2021 our primary new store format averages approximately 8500 square feet of selling space we generally have had good success in locating suitable store sites in the past and we believe that there is ample opportunity for new store growth in existing and new markets in addition we believe we have significant opportunities available for our relocation and remodel programs

​ 

our store growth over the past three years is summarized in the following table

​ 

 ​ 

our customers 

​ 

our customers seek value and convenience depending on their financial situation and geographic proximity customers’ reliance on dollar general varies from fillin shopping to making periodic trips to stock up on household items to making weekly or more frequent trips to meet most essential needs we generally locate our stores and plan our merchandise selections to best serve the needs of our core customers the low and fixed income households often underserved by other retailers including grocers and we are focused on helping them make the most of their spending dollars at the same time however dollar general shoppers from a wide range of income 

brackets and life stages appreciate our quality merchandise as well as our attractive value and convenience proposition

​ 

our suppliers 

​ 

we purchase merchandise from a wide variety of suppliers and maintain direct buying relationships with many producers of national brand merchandise despite our broad offering we maintain only a limited number of items per category allowing us to keep our average costs low our two largest suppliers accounted for approximately 9 and 8 respectively of our purchases in 2021 our private brands come from a wide variety of suppliers we directly imported approximately 6 of our purchases at cost in 2021 

​ 

in 2020 and 2021 covid19 and its impacts caused disruptions in our supply chain at times making it more difficult to obtain certain products in sufficient quantities to meet customer demand and increasing distribution and transportation costs we anticipate these covid19 effects to persist to some degree although the ultimate extent and duration of the covid19 pandemic and its effects are unknown prior to 2020 we had generally been able to obtain sufficient quantities of core merchandise and in cases where one or more of our current sources of supply became unavailable we generally had been able to obtain alternative sources in situations where it becomes necessary to secure alternative sources we may experience increased merchandise costs and supply chain lead time and expenses a temporary reduction in store inventory levels and reduced product selection or quality an inability to obtain alternative sources could adversely affect our sales 

​ 

distribution and transportation 

​ 

our stores are currently supported by distribution centers for both refrigerated and nonrefrigerated merchandise located strategically throughout our geographic footprint we lease additional temporary warehouse space as necessary to support our distribution needs in addition to our traditional distribution centers we now operate multiple temperaturecontrolled distribution facilities in support of “dg fresh” our strategic multiphased shift to selfdistribution of frozen and refrigerated goods such as dairy deli and frozen products we regularly analyze and rebalance the network to ensure that it remains efficient and provides the service levels our stores require see “—properties” below for additional information pertaining to our distribution centers

​ 

most of our merchandise flows through our distribution centers and is delivered to our stores by our private fleet and by thirdparty trucking firms utilizing our trailers in addition vendors or thirdparty distributors deliver or ship certain food items and other merchandise directly to our stores

​ 

seasonality 

​ 

the nature of our business is somewhat seasonal generally our operating profit has been greater in the fourth quarter which includes the christmas selling season as compared with operating profit in each of the first three quarters of our fiscal year in addition our quarterly results can be affected by the timing of certain holidays new store openings remodels relocations and store closings consumer behavior driven by the covid19 pandemic and its accompanying impacts has resulted in a departure from seasonal norms we have experienced in recent years and may continue to disrupt the historical quarterly cadence of our results of operations for an unknown period of time

​ 

our competition 

​ 

we operate in the basic discount consumer goods market which is highly competitive with respect to price customers store location merchandise quality assortment and presentation service offerings instock consistency customer service promotional activity employees and market share we compete with discount stores and many other retailers including mass merchandise warehouse club grocery drug convenience variety online and certain specialty stores these other retail companies operate stores in many of the areas where we operate and many of them engage in extensive advertising and marketing efforts our direct competitors include family dollar dollar tree big lots 99 cents only and various local independent operators as well as walmart target kroger aldi walgreens cvs and rite aid among others certain of our competitors have greater financial distribution 

marketing and other resources than we do and may be able to secure better arrangements from suppliers than we can competition is intense and we believe it will continue to be so with certain competitors reducing their store locations while others move into or increase their presence in our geographic and product markets and increase the availability of mobile webbased and other digital technology to facilitate a more convenient and competitive online and instore customer shopping experience

​ 

we believe that we differentiate ourselves from other forms of retailing by offering consistently low prices in a convenient smallstore format we are able to maintain competitive prices due in part to our lowcost operating structure and the relatively limited assortment of products offered purchasing large volumes of merchandise within our focused assortment in each merchandise category allows us to keep our average product costs low contributing to our ability to offer competitive everyday low prices to our customers see “—our business model” above for further discussion of our competitive situation

​ 

our intellectual property 

​ 

we own marks that are registered with the united states patent and trademark office and are protected under applicable intellectual property laws including without limitation dollar general® dg® clover valley® trueliving® and p opshelf® along with variations and formatives of these trademarks we attempt to obtain registration of our trademarks whenever practicable and to pursue vigorously any infringement of those marks our trademark registrations have various expiration dates however assuming that the trademark registrations are properly renewed they have a perpetual duration we also hold an exclusive license to the rexall brand through at least march 5 2029 and the believe beauty brand through at least march 18 2025

​ 

human capital resources 

​ 

at dollar general a foundational element in how we operate is exemplified in our fourth operating priority – investing in our diverse teams through development empowerment and inclusion building on our core value of respecting the dignity and differences of others our goal is to create a work environment where each employee is encouraged and empowered to bring their unique perspective and voice to work each day based on a talent philosophy of “attract develop and retain” whether an individual works in a store a distribution center our store support center or our international offices over the last 80 years we have helped millions of individuals start and progress in their careers providing employees with numerous opportunities to gain new skills and develop their talents supported by our awardwinning training and development programs 

​ 

attract 

​ 

we seek to provide market competitive compensation and benefits packages that attract talent to the organization and then retain and incent employees for performance although eligibility for and the level of benefits vary depending on the employee’s fulltime or parttime status compensation level date of hire andor length of service the broad range of benefits we provide or make available may include medical prescription telemedicine dental and vision plans flexible spending accounts disability insurance 401k plan paid vacation employee assistance program with access to legal assistance and counseling healthy lifestyle and disease management programs education assistance benefits parental leave adoption assistance service award recognition and a broad range of discounts for other products and services to help measure the success of our overall employee compensation and benefits programs we monitor employee applicant flow and staffing levels across the organization as well as employee turnover particularly at the store manager level

​ 

develop 

​ 

as a testament to our employee development efforts in february 2021 we were inducted into training magazine’s hall of fame following two consecutive years as the magazine’s top training and development program and rounding out 10 consecutive years among its top 100 list in 2021 we estimate we invested over three million training hours in our employees to promote their education and development 

​ 

our internal promotion rate helps us measure the success of our development programs as of february 25 2022 we employed approximately 163000 fulltime and parttime employees including divisional and regional managers district managers store managers other store personnel and distribution center fleet and administrative personnel as of the end of 2021 approximately 76 of store managers and thousands of additional employees including several members of our senior leadership have been promoted from within our organization 

​ 

retain 

​ 

to ensure we are creating an environment where our employees feel respected safe empowered and motivated we regularly monitor retention and engagement levels across the organization through a variety of means working to understand what is important to our employees and how we can best continue to meet their evolving needs 

​ 

compliance with governmental regulations 

​ 

our operations are subject to the applicable federal state local and foreign laws rules and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate or conduct business these laws rules and regulations relate to among other things the sale of products including without limitation product and food safety marketing and labeling information security and privacy labor and employment employee wages and benefits health and safety real property public accommodations antibribery financial reporting and disclosure antitrust and fair competition anti money laundering transportation imports and customs intellectual property taxes and environmental compliance

​ 

although we routinely incur significant costs in complying with the laws and regulations applicable to the company and we can make no guarantees that future such costs will not be material to date compliance with these laws rules and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position many of our entrylevel store employees are paid at rates in line with the applicable state minimum wage and consequently in certain situations increases to such wage rates have increased our labor costs if federal state andor local minimum wage ratessalary levels were to increase significantly andor rapidly compliance with such increases could adversely affect our earnings additionally if significant changes in the federal state or foreign corporate tax rates occur in the future such change could adversely affect our overall effective tax rate and earnings see “risk factors” in part i item 1a for additional information regarding government regulations that could impact our business

business strategic and competitive risks 

the covid19 pandemic has continued to impact our business financial performance and financial condition and could have a material adverse impact on our business financial performance and financial condition in the future 

the covid19 pandemic has resulted in widespread and continuing adverse impacts on and volatility in the global economy and has continued to impact our business employees customers suppliers and other business partners considerable uncertainty exists regarding the extent to which the covid19 pandemic’s existing and new variants will continue as well as the scope duration and effectiveness of continued measures directed at containment and mitigation of the virus including travel bans and restrictions quarantines school closures vaccination rollouts including any boosters vaccine andor testing initiatives and mandates restrictions on large gatherings and social distancing directives and business and government restrictions and shutdowns these measures taken by national state and local government authorities to date have had serious adverse impacts on domestic and foreign economies and could have a significant adverse impact on our core customer and her spending for an unknown length of time the timing scope and potential effect of any additional economic stabilization efforts including additional government stimulus payments foodnutrition assistance and enhanced unemployment benefits is uncertain if customer spending on the goods we sell declines as a result of some or all of these factors there could be a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations

we have been classified as an essential business in all locations where we operate and as such our stores generally have remained open to serve our customers while none of the below has resulted in an overall material adverse impact on our business financial performance or financial condition to date we have experienced or are experiencing certain effects of the covid19 pandemic including but not limited to the following



 ​ 

depending on the duration and severity of the covid19 pandemic including whether there are additional “waves” other additional periods of increases or spikes in the number of covid19 cases or variants thereof and the availability acceptance and efficacy of medical treatments vaccines including both adult and pediatric booster vaccines effect of vaccine andor testing mandates and related regulations which are uncertain and cannot be predicted as well as governmental authorities’ responses and requirements related to the pandemic including the pace and extent of the easing or removal of restrictions on businesses and customers or the reinstitution of more stringent regulations these experienced effects could have a material adverse impact on our business financial performance and financial condition in the future if they increase in number duration andor magnitude we also could experience other effects that could aggravate or increase the likelihood of the risk factors set forth herein andor result in a material adverse impact on our business financial performance or financial condition including but not limited to the financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers or business partners including the financial failure of one or more of our international steamship line vendors resulting in our inability to obtain our purchased goods in their possession increased operating costs as a result of increased government regulations and mandates requiring us to provide wage increases or premiums to frontline employees personal protective equipment or personal hygiene supplies to customers or to increase store and distribution center cleaning protocols as well as store andor distribution center closures as a result of increased government enforcement of any such new regulations and mandates increased litigation expenses resulting from employee or customer lawsuits including those related to the company’s covid19 response and alleged employee or customer contraction increased insurance costs medical claims costs and workers’ compensation claim costs and the impact of regulatory and judicial changes in liability for workers’ compensation and damage to our reputation if our response to the covid19 pandemic is perceived as inadequate or inappropriate additionally the covid19 pandemic’s new and existing variants may cause or accelerate a shift in our core customer’s behaviors expectations and shopping trends which could result in lost sales and market share if we are not able to successfully increase the pace of our strategic initiatives development particularly our digital strategic initiatives and if our current digital shopping offerings do not continue to compete effectively 

the extent to which the covid19 pandemic ultimately impacts our business financial performance and financial condition will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including but not limited to the duration and spread of the outbreak and any variants thereof its severity the actions to contain and mitigate the virus or treat its impact and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume as a result we may not be able to identify all risks ultimately faced from the covid19 pandemic and its aftermath

economic factors may reduce our customers’ spending impair our ability to execute our strategies and initiatives and increase our costs and expenses which could result in materially decreased sales andor profitability 

many of our customers have fixed or low incomes and limited discretionary spending dollars any factor that could adversely affect their disposable income could decrease our customers’ spending or cause them to shift their spending to our lower margin product choices which could result in materially decreased sales andor profitability factors that could reduce our customers’ disposable income include but are not limited to high unemployment or underemployment levels or decline in real wages inflation pandemics such as the covid19 pandemic higher fuel energy healthcare and housing costs interest rates consumer debt levels and tax rates tax law changes that negatively affect credits and refunds lack of available credit and decreases in or elimination of government stimulus programs or subsidies such as unemployment foodnutrition assistance programs and the child tax credit

many of the economic factors listed above as well as commodity rates transportation lease and insurance costs wage rates including the heightened possibility of increased federal state andor local minimum wage rates foreign exchange rate fluctuations measures that create barriers to or increase the costs of international trade including increased import duties or tariffs changes in applicable laws and regulations including tax laws related 

to the corporate tax rate and other economic factors also could impair our ability to successfully execute our strategies and initiatives as well as increase our cost of goods sold and selling general and administrative expenses including real estate costs and may have other adverse consequences that we are unable to fully anticipate or control all of which may materially decrease our sales or profitability 

our plans depend significantly on strategies and initiatives designed to increase sales and profitability and improve the efficiencies costs and effectiveness of our operations and failure to achieve or sustain these plans could materially affect our results of operations 

we have shortterm and longterm strategies and initiatives such as those relating to merchandising real estate and new store development international expansion store formats and concepts digital marketing health services shrink sourcing private brand inventory management supply chain store operations expense reduction and technology in various stages of testing evaluation and implementation which are designed to continue to improve our results of operations and financial condition the effectiveness of these initiatives is inherently uncertain even when tested successfully and is dependent on consistency of training and execution workforce stability ease of execution and scalability and the absence of offsetting factors that can influence results adversely the number and diverse geographic locations of our stores and distribution centers and our decentralized field management also contribute to the challenging nature of these factors other risk factors described herein also could negatively affect general implementation failure to achieve successful or costeffective implementation of our initiatives could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition

the success of our merchandising initiatives particularly our nonconsumable initiatives including our new popshelf concept and efforts to increase sales of higher margin products within the consumables category further depends in part upon our ability to predict the products that our customers will demand and to identify and timely respond to evolving trends in consumer preferences and demographic mixes in our markets if we are unable to select and timely obtain products that are attractive to customers and at costs that allow us to sell them at an acceptable profit or to effectively market such products it could result in materially decreased sales and profitability 

the success of our cold chain selfdistribution initiative dg fresh further depends in part on the availability of certain supply chain resources including temperaturecontrolled distribution centers refrigerated transportation equipment and drivers the success of our fast track initiative which is designed to enhance our instore labor productivity onshelf availability and customer convenience further depends in part on successful acquisition implementation and maintenance of the necessary hardware and technology continued customer interest and adoption of selfcheckout our ability to gain cost efficiencies and control shrink levels from the initiative and vendor cooperation the success of dg media network which is our platform for connecting brand partners with our customers to drive even greater value for each further depends on our ability to successfully gather target customer audiences that deliver consistent predictable and beneficial returns on advertising spending so as to generate interest and demand from our brand partners as well as to properly handle and secure all sensitive customer data 

we face intense competition that could limit our growth opportunities and materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

the retail business is highly competitive with respect to price customers store location merchandise quality product assortment and presentation service offerings product sourcing and supply chain capacity instock consistency customer service ease of shopping experience promotional activity employees and market share we compete with discount stores and many other retailers including mass merchandise warehouse club grocery drug convenience variety online retailers and certain specialty stores to maintain our competitive position we may be required to lower prices either temporarily or permanently and may have limited ability to increase prices in response to increased costs resulting in lower margins and reduced profitability certain of our competitors have greater financial distribution marketing and other resources and may be able to secure better arrangements with suppliers than we 

competition is intense and is expected to continue to be so with certain competitors reducing their store locations while others enter or increase their presence in our geographic and product markets including through the expansion of availability of delivery services and expand availability of mobile webbased and other digital technologies to facilitate a more convenient and competitive online and instore shopping experience if our competitors or others were to enter our industry in a significant way including through alliances or other business combinations it could significantly alter the competitive dynamics of the retail marketplace and result in competitors with greatly improved competitive positions which could materially affect our financial performance our ability to effectively compete will depend substantially upon our continued ability to develop and execute compelling and costeffective strategies and initiatives if we fail to anticipate or respond effectively to competitive pressures and industry changes it could materially affect our results of operations and financial condition

operational risks 

if we cannot timely and costeffectively execute our real estate projects and meet our financial expectations or if we do not anticipate or successfully address the challenges imposed by our expansion including into new countries or domestic markets states or urban or suburban areas it could materially impede our planned future growth and our profitability 

delays in or failure to complete a significant portion of our real estate projects or failure to meet our financial expectations for these projects could materially and adversely affect our growth and our profitability our ability to timely open relocate and remodel profitable stores and expand into additional market areas is a key component of our planned future growth and may depend in part on the availability of suitable store locations and capital funding the absence of entitlement process or occupancy delays including zoning restrictions and moratoria on small box discount retail development such as those passed by certain local governments in areas where we operate or seek to operate supply chain volatility resulting in delivery delays and in some cases lack of availability of store equipment building materials and store merchandise for resale the ability to negotiate acceptable lease and development terms for example real estate development requirements and cost of building materials and labor to costeffectively hire and train qualified new personnel especially store managers and to identify and accurately assess sufficient customer demand and general economic conditions while we have experienced certain of these factors at heightened levels in fiscal 2021 to date they have not materially impaired our ability to complete our planned real estate projects or growth and thus have not had a material adverse effect on our financial performance however if the heightened levels which we have recently experienced increase or are sustained for an extended period of time we expect that they could have a material adverse effect on our ability to complete our future planned real estate projects or growth and in turn a material adverse effect on our financial performance 

we also may not anticipate or successfully address all of the challenges imposed by the expansion of our operations including our new popshelf store concept including into new countries or domestic markets states or urban or suburban areas where we have limited or no meaningful experience or brand recognition those areas may have different regulatory environments competitive and market conditions consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns than our existing markets as well as higher cost of entry and operating costs these factors may cause our new stores to be less profitable than stores in our existing markets which could slow future growth in these areas in addition many new stores will be located in areas where we have existing stores which inadvertently may temporarily or permanently divert a larger than anticipated number of customers and sales from our existing stores thereby adversely affecting our overall financial performance

inventory shrinkage may negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we experience significant inventory shrinkage although some level of inventory shrinkage is an unavoidable cost of doing business higher rates of inventory shrinkage or increased security or other costs to combat inventory theft could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to contain or reduce inventory shrinkage

our cash flows from operations profitability and financial condition may be negatively affected if we are not successful in managing our inventory balances 

our inventory balance represented approximately 52 of our total assets exclusive of goodwill operating lease assets and other intangible assets as of january 28 2022 efficient inventory management is a key component of our business success and profitability we must maintain sufficient inventory levels and an appropriate product mix to meet our customers’ demands without allowing those levels to increase such that the costs to store and hold the goods unduly impacts our financial results or increases the risk of inventory shrinkage if we do not accurately predict customer trends spending levels or price sensitivity we may have to take unanticipated markdowns to dispose of the excess inventory which also can adversely affect our financial results we continue to focus on ways to reduce these risks but we cannot make assurances that we will be successful in our inventory management if we are not successful in managing our inventory balances our cash flows from operations and financial condition may be negatively affected

failure to maintain the security of our business customer employee or vendor information or to comply with privacy laws could expose us to litigation government enforcement actions and costly response measures and could materially harm our reputation and affect our business and financial performance 

in connection with sales we transmit confidential credit and debit card information which is encrypted using pointtopoint encryption we also have access to collect or maintain certain private or confidential information regarding our customers employees and their dependents and vendors as well as our business some of this information is stored electronically in connection with our ecommerce and mobile applications some of which may leverage thirdparty service providers additionally we may share information with and depend upon select vendors to assist us in conducting our business while we have implemented procedures and technology intended to protect such information and require appropriate controls of our vendors external attackers could compromise such controls and result in unauthorized disclosure of such information as attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated may include attacks on our thirdparty business partners and do not always or immediately produce detectable indicators of compromise moreover inadvertent or malicious internal personnel actions could result in a defeat of security measures and a compromise of our or our thirdparty vendors’ information systems furthermore if a vendor is the victim of a cyberattack including a ransomware attack such attack could have a corresponding material effect on our ability to do business with that vendor or to receive information that may be required to timely prepare our financial statements due to the political uncertainty involving russia and ukraine there is an increased likelihood that escalation of tensions could result in cyberattacks that could either directly or indirectly impact our operations like other retailers we and our vendors have experienced threats to and incidents involving data and systems including by perpetrators of attempted random or targeted malicious attacks computer malware ransomware bots or other destructive or disruptive software and attempts to misappropriate our information and cause system failures and disruptions although to date none have been material to our business if attackers obtain customer employee or vendor passwords through unrelated thirdparty breaches and if impacted customers employees or vendors do not employ good online security practices eg use the same password across different sites or do not use multifactor authentication these passwords could be used to gain access to their information or accounts with us in certain situations

because we accept debit and credit cards for payment we are subject to industry data protection standards and protocols such as the payment card industry data security standards issued by the payment card industry security standards council nonetheless we may be vulnerable to and unable to detect and appropriately respond to cardholder data security breaches and data loss including successful attacks on applications systems or networks 

a significant security breach of any kind experienced by us or one of our vendors which could be undetected for a period of time or a significant failure by us or one of our vendors to comply with applicable privacy and information security laws regulations and standards could expose us to risks of data loss litigation government enforcement actions fines or penalties credit card brand assessments negative publicity and reputational harm business disruption and costly response measures eg providing notification to and credit monitoring services for affected individuals as well as further upgrades to our security measures procuring a replacement vendor if one of our current vendors is unable to fulfill its obligations to us due to a cyberattack or 

incident which may not be covered by or may exceed the coverage limits of our insurance policies and could materially disrupt our operations any resulting negative publicity could significantly harm our reputation which could cause us to lose market share as a result of customers discontinuing the use of our ecommerce and mobile applications or debit or credit cards in our stores or not shopping in our stores altogether and could materially and adversely affect our business and financial performance

material damage or interruptions to our information systems as a result of external factors staffing shortages or challenges in maintaining or updating our existing technology or developing or implementing new technology could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we depend on a variety of information technology systems including systems owned and managed by thirdparty vendors for the efficient functioning of our business including without limitation transaction processing and the management of our employees facilities logistics inventories stores and customerfacing digital applications and operations our technology initiatives may not deliver desired results or may do so on a delayed schedule additionally such systems are subject to damage or interruption from power surges and outages facility damage physical theft computer and telecommunications failures inadequate or ineffective redundancy malicious code including malware ransomware or similar successful attacks eg account compromise phishing denial of service and application network or system vulnerability exploitation software upgrade failures or code defects natural disasters and human error due to the political uncertainty involving russia and ukraine there is an increased likelihood that escalation of tensions could result in cyberattacks that could either directly or indirectly impact our operations design defects damage to or interruption to these systems may require a significant investment to repair or replace disrupt our operations and affect our ability to meet business and reporting requirements result in the loss or corruption of critical data and harm our reputation all of which could materially and adversely affect our business or results of operations

we also rely heavily on our information technology staff failure to meet these staffing needs may negatively affect our ability to fulfill our technology initiatives while continuing to provide maintenance on existing systems we rely on third parties to maintain and periodically upgrade many of these systems so that they can continue to support our business we license the software programs supporting many of our systems from independent software developers the inability of these vendors developers or us to continue to maintain and upgrade these systems and software programs could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations or retain vulnerability exploitation risk if we were unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner and could expose us to greater risk of a successful attack in addition costs and delays associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology including the migration of applications to the cloud or our current implementation of our new point of sale system or with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems also could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations fail to operate as designed result in the potential loss or corruption of data or information disrupt operations and affect our ability to meet business and reporting requirements and adversely affect our profitability

a significant disruption to our distribution network the capacity of our distribution centers or the timely receipt of inventory could adversely affect sales or increase our transportation costs which would decrease our profitability 

we rely on our distribution and transportation network to provide goods to our stores timely and cost effectively using various transportation modes including ocean rail and truck we and our vendors move goods from vendor locations to our distribution centers and our stores any disruption unanticipated or unusual expense or operational failure related to this process could negatively impact sales and profits we experienced in fiscal 2021 and continue to experience increased fuel costs as well as inventory receipt and delivery delays and increases in transportation costs including increased import freight costs and carrier and driver wages as a result of driver shortages as a result of a decrease in transportation capacity for overseas shipments port closures or congestion and labor shortages labor shortages or work stoppages or slowdowns in the transportation industry or disruptions to the national and international transportation infrastructure that necessitate our securing alternative labor or shipping suppliers could also increase our costs or otherwise negatively affect our business the covid19 pandemic has disrupted the global and domestic transportation and distribution of goods and resulted in product delivery delays and higher delivery prices the supply chain disruptions that we have experienced to date as a result 

of the covid19 pandemic had a material negative impact on our financial results in fiscal 2021 depending on the continued extent and duration of these disruptions our distribution network results of operations including sales or future business may continue to be materially and adversely impacted 

we maintain a network of distribution facilities and are moving forward with plans to build or lease new facilities to support our growth objectives and strategic initiatives delays in opening such facilities could adversely affect our financial performance by slowing store growth including accelerated popshelf store growth plans or the rollout of certain strategic initiatives such as our dg fresh initiative which may in turn reduce revenue growth andor profitability or by increasing transportation and product costs in addition distributionrelated construction or expansion projects entail risks that could cause delays and cost overruns such as shortages of materials or skilled labor work stoppages unforeseen construction scheduling engineering environmental or geological problems weather interference fires or other casualty losses and unanticipated cost increases for these reasons the completion date and ultimate cost of these projects could differ significantly from initial expectations and we cannot guarantee that any project will be completed on time or within established budgets

risks associated with or faced by our suppliers could adversely affect our financial performance 

we source our merchandise from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers and we depend on them to supply merchandise in a timely and efficient manner and in the large volumes that we may require in 2021 our two largest suppliers accounted for approximately 9 and 8 respectively of our purchases if one or more of our current sources of supply became unavailable we believe we generally would be able to obtain alternative sources but it could increase our merchandise costs and supply chain lead time and expenses result in a temporary reduction in store inventory levels and reduce the selection and quality of our merchandise an inability to obtain alternative sources could materially decrease our sales additionally if a supplier fails to deliver on its commitments we could experience merchandise outofstocks that could lead to lost sales and reputational harm further failure of suppliers to meet our compliance protocols could prolong our procurement lead time resulting in lost sales and adverse margin impact

we directly imported approximately 6 of our purchases measured at cost in 2021 but many of our domestic vendors directly import their products or components of their products changes to the prices and flow of these goods often are for reasons beyond our control such as political or civil unrest acts of war disruptive global political events for example the current conflict between russia and ukraine currency fluctuations disruptions in maritime lanes port labor disputes economic conditions and instability in countries in which foreign suppliers are located the financial instability of suppliers failure to meet our terms and conditions or our standards issues with our suppliers’ labor practices or labor problems they may experience such as strikes stoppages or slowdowns which could also increase labor costs during and following the disruption the availability and cost of raw materials pandemic outbreaks merchandise quality or safety issues transport availability and cost increases in wage rates and taxes transport security inflation and other factors relating to suppliers and the countries in which they are located or from which they import such changes could adversely affect our operations and profitability 

while we are working to diversify our sources of imported goods a substantial amount of our imported merchandise comes from china and thus a change in the chinese leadership the effects of pandemic outbreaks including covid19 economic and market conditions internal economic stimulus actions or currency or other policies as well as trade relations between china and the united states and increases in costs of labor could negatively impact our merchandise costs we experienced delays in the receipt of certain goods from international and domestic shipping origins as a result of the covid19 pandemic and more general global supply chain constraints in fiscal 2021 depending on the continued extent and duration of these constraints and disruptions our supply chain results of operations including sales or future business may be materially and adversely impacted in addition the united states’ foreign trade policies duties tariffs and other impositions on imported goods trade sanctions imposed on certain countries particularly china and entities import limitations on certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade and port labor agreements are beyond our control these and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our business and financial performance if we increase our product imports from foreign vendors the risks associated with these imports also will increase and we may be exposed to additional or different risks as we increase imports of goods produced in countries other than china

natural disasters and unusual weather conditions whether or not caused by climate change pandemic outbreaks or other health crises political or civil unrest acts of war violence or terrorism and disruptive global political events could disrupt business and result in lower sales andor profitability and otherwise adversely affect our financial performance 

the occurrence of one or more natural disasters such as hurricanes fires floods tornadoes and earthquakes unusual weather conditions pandemic outbreaks or other health crises including but not limited to the covid19 pandemic political or civil unrest acts of war violence or terrorism including within our stores distribution centers or other company property or disruptive global political events for example the current conflict between russia and ukraine or similar disruptions could adversely affect our reputation business and financial performance if any of these events result in the closure or a limitation on operating hours of one or more of our distribution centers a significant number of stores our sourcing offices our corporate headquarters or data center or impact one or more of our key suppliers our operations and financial performance could be materially and adversely affected through an inability or reduced ability to make deliveries process payroll or provide other support functions to our stores and through lost sales these events also could affect consumer shopping patterns or prevent customers from reaching our stores which could lead to lost sales and higher markdowns or result in increases in fuel or other energy prices fuel shortages new store or distribution center opening delays the temporary lack of an adequate work force in a market the temporary or longterm disruption of product availability in our stores the temporary or longterm inability to obtain or access technology needed to effectively run our business disruption of our utility services or information systems and damage to our reputation these events may also increase the costs of insurance if they result in significant loss of property or other insurable damage by us or in the market more generally

furthermore the longterm impacts of global climate change present the possibility of both physical risks such as extreme weather conditions or rising sea levels and transition risks such as regulatory or technology changes which may be widespread and unpredictable over time these changes could affect for example the availability and cost of products commodities and energy including utilities which in turn may impact our ability to procure goods and services required for the operation of our businesses at the quantities and levels we require in addition our operations and facilities may be located in areas impacted by the physical risks of climate change and we face the risk of losses incurred as a result of physical damage to stores distribution centers or our corporate offices as well as loss or spoilage of inventory and business interruption caused by such events we also use natural gas diesel fuel and gasoline and electricity in our operations all of which could face increased regulation as a result of climate change or other environmental concerns regulations limiting greenhouse gas emissions and energy inputs may also increase in coming years which may increase our costs associated with compliance and merchandise these events and their impacts could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations and could materially adversely affect our financial performance 

product liability product recall or other product safety or labeling claims could adversely affect our business reputation and financial performance 

we depend on our vendors to ensure that the products we buy from them comply with applicable product safety and labeling laws and regulations and to inform us of all applicable restrictions on the sale of such products nonetheless product liability personal injury or other claims may be asserted against us relating to alleged product contamination tampering expiration mislabeling recall and other safety or labeling issues including those relating to products that we may selfdistribute through our dg fresh initiative

we seek but may not be successful in obtaining contractual indemnification and insurance coverage for productrelated claims and issues from our vendors if we do not have adequate contractual indemnification or insurance available or our vendors fails to adhere to their obligations to us such claims could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations our ability to obtain indemnification from foreign vendors may be hindered by our ability to obtain jurisdiction over them to enforce contractual obligations even with adequate insurance and indemnification such claims could significantly harm our reputation and consumer confidence in our products and we could incur significant litigation expenses which also could materially affect our results of operations even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or not fully pursued

our current insurance program may expose us to unexpected costs and negatively affect our financial performance 

our insurance coverage reflects deductibles selfinsured retentions limits of liability and similar provisions that we believe are prudent based on our operations however there are types of losses we may incur but against which we cannot be insured or which we believe are not economically reasonable to insure such as losses due to acts of war certain crimes including employee crime certain wage and hour and other employmentrelated claims and litigation actions based on certain consumer protection laws and some natural and other disasters or similar events if we incur material uninsured losses our financial performance could suffer certain material events have resulted and may result again in the future in sizable losses for the insurance industry and adversely affect the availability of adequate insurance coverage or result in excessive premium increases to offset negative insurance market trends we may elect to selfinsure accept higher deductibles or reduce the amount of coverage in addition we selfinsure a significant portion of expected losses under our workers’ compensation automobile liability general liability including claims made against certain of our landlords property loss and group health insurance programs significant changes in actuarial assumptions and management estimates underlying our recorded liabilities for these losses including any expected increases in medical and indemnity costs could result in materially different expenses than expected under these programs which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition although we maintain property insurance for catastrophic events at our store support center and distribution centers we are effectively selfinsured for other property losses if we experience a greater number of these losses than we anticipate our financial performance could be adversely affected

failure to attract develop and retain qualified employees while controlling labor costs as well as other labor issues could adversely affect our financial performance 

our future growth and performance positive customer experience and legal and regulatory compliance depends on our ability to attract develop retain and motivate qualified employees while operating in an industry challenged by historically high rates of employee turnover our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling our labor costs is subject to many external factors including competition for and availability of qualified personnel unemployment levels wage rates and salary levels including the heightened possibility of increased federal state andor local minimum wage ratessalary levels health and other insurance costs changes in employment and labor laws or other workplace regulations including those relating to employee benefit programs such as health insurance and paid leave programs employee activism and our reputation and relevance within the labor market if we are unable to attract develop and retain adequate numbers of qualified employees our operations customer service levels legal and regulatory compliance and support functions could suffer in addition to the extent a significant portion of our employee base unionizes or attempts to unionize our labor and other related costs could increase and it is possible that federal agencies may adopt or impose regulatory or other changes to existing law that could facilitate union organizing our ability to pass along labor and other related costs to our customers is constrained by our everyday low price model and we may not be able to offset such increased costs elsewhere in our business

our success depends on our executive officers and other key personnel if we lose key personnel or are unable to hire additional qualified personnel our business may be harmed 

our future success depends to a significant degree on the skills experience and efforts of our executive officers and other key personnel the unexpected loss of the services of any of such persons could adversely affect our operations there can be no assurance that our executive succession planning retention or hiring efforts will be successful competition for skilled and experienced management personnel is intense and a failure to attract and retain new qualified personnel could adversely affect our operations 

our private brands may not be successful in improving our gross profit rate and may increase certain of the risks we face 

the sale of private brand items is an important component of our sales growth and gross profit rate enhancement plans broad market acceptance of our private brands depends on many factors including pricing quality customer perception and timely development and introduction of new products we cannot give assurance 

that we will achieve or maintain our expected level of private brand sales the sale and expansion of these offerings also subjects us to or increases certain risks such as product liability claims and product recalls disruptions in raw material and finished product supply and distribution chains inability to successfully protect our proprietary rights claims related to the proprietary rights of third parties supplier labor and human rights issues and other risks generally encountered by entities that source sell and market exclusive branded offerings for retail failure to appropriately address these risks could materially and adversely affect our private brand initiatives reputation results of operations and financial condition

because our business is somewhat seasonal adverse events during the fourth quarter could materially affect our financial statements as a whole 

primarily because of sales of christmasrelated merchandise our most profitable sales mix generally occurs in the fourth quarter in anticipation of this holiday we purchase substantial amounts of seasonal inventory and if sales fall below seasonal norms or our expectations it could result in unanticipated markdowns adverse events such as deteriorating economic conditions high unemployment rates high gas prices transportation disruptions or unusual or unanticipated adverse weather could result in lowerthanplanned sales during the christmas selling season which in turn could reduce our profitability and otherwise adversely affect our financial performance and operating results

failure to protect our reputation could adversely affect our business 

our success depends in part on the protection of the reputation of dollar general and the products and services we sell including our private brands failure to comply or accusation of failure to comply with ethical social product labor data privacy consumer protection safety environmental and other applicable standards could jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer shareholder or nongovernmental organization ngo actions litigation and governmental investigations in addition our position or perceived lack of position on certain issues eg public policy social or environmental issues and any perceived lack of transparency about such matters could harm our reputation and potentially lead to adverse consumer shareholder or ngo actions including negative public statements similar incidents or factors involving vendors and other third parties with whom we conduct business also may affect our reputation public comments on social media whether or not they are accurate have the potential to quickly influence negative perceptions of dollar general or our goods and services including our private brands negative reputational incidents could adversely affect our business through lost sales loss of new store and development opportunities or employee retention and recruiting difficulties 

regulatory legal compliance and accounting risks 

a significant change in governmental regulations and requirements could materially increase our cost of doing business and noncompliance with governmental regulations could materially and adversely affect our financial performance 

we routinely incur significant costs in complying with numerous and frequently changing laws and regulations the complexity of this regulatory environment and related compliance costs continue to increase due to additional legal and regulatory requirements our expanding operations and increased regulatory scrutiny and enforcement efforts new or revised laws regulations policies and related interpretations and enforcement practices particularly those dealing with the sale of products including without limitation product and food safety marketing or labeling information security and privacy labor and employment employee wages and benefits health and safety imports and customs taxes bribery climate change and environmental compliance may significantly increase our expenses or require extensive system and operating changes that could materially increase our cost of doing business violations of applicable laws and regulations or untimely or incomplete execution of a required product recall can result in significant penalties including loss of licenses eligibility to accept certain government benefits such as snap or significant fines class action or other litigation governmental investigation or action and reputational damage additionally changes in tax laws including those related to the federal state or foreign corporate tax rate the interpretation of existing laws or our failure to sustain our reporting positions on examination could adversely affect our overall effective tax rate furthermore significant andor rapid increases to 

federal state andor local minimum wage ratessalary levels could adversely affect our earnings if we are not able to otherwise offset these increased labor costs elsewhere in our business moreover the adoption of new environmental laws and regulations in connection with climate change and the transition to a low carbon economy including any federal or state laws enacted to regulate greenhouse gas emissions could significantly increase our operating or merchandise costs or reduce the demand for our products these laws and regulations may include but are not limited to requirements relating to hazardous waste materials recycling singleuse plastics extended producer responsibility use of refrigerants carbon pricing or carbon taxes product energy efficiency standards and product labeling if carbon pricing or carbon taxes are adopted there is a significant risk that the cost of merchandise from our suppliers will increase and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

legal proceedings may adversely affect our reputation business results of operations and financial condition 

our business is subject to the risk of litigation or other legal proceedings by employees consumers suppliers competitors shareholders government agencies and others through private actions class actions multidistrict litigation arbitrations derivative actions administrative proceedings regulatory actions or other litigation for example we are involved in certain legal proceedings as discussed in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements the outcome of legal proceedings particularly class action or multidistrict litigation or mass arbitrations and regulatory actions can be difficult to assess or quantify plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts and the magnitude of the potential loss may remain unknown for lengthy periods in addition certain of these matters if decided adversely to us or settled by us may result in liability material to our financial statements as a whole or may negatively affect our operating results if changes to our business operations are required and sometimes these developments are unanticipated legal proceedings in general and class actions multidistrict litigation governmental investigations and actions and derivative actions in particular can be expensive and disruptive and adverse publicity could harm our reputation regardless of the validity of the allegations as a result legal proceedings may adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition see also note 7 to the consolidated financial statements

new accounting guidance or changes in the interpretation or application of existing accounting guidance could adversely affect our financial performance 

the implementation of new accounting standards could require certain systems internal process and controls and other changes that could increase our operating costs and result in changes to our financial statements 

us generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by our management changes in these rules or their interpretation or in underlying management assumptions estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance the outcome of such changes could include litigation or regulatory actions which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

financial and capital market risks 

deterioration in market conditions or changes in our credit profile could adversely affect our business operations and financial condition 

we rely on the positive cash flow we generate from our operating activities and our access to the credit and capital markets to fund our operations growth strategy and return of cash to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends changes in the credit and capital markets including market disruptions limited liquidity and interest rate fluctuations may increase the cost of financing or restrict our access to these potential sources of future liquidity our continued access to liquidity sources on favorable terms depends on multiple factors including our operating performance and credit ratings our debt securities currently are rated investment grade and a downgrade of this rating likely would negatively impact our access to the debt capital markets and increase our cost of borrowing as a result disruptions in the debt markets or any downgrade of our credit ratings could adversely affect our business operations and financial condition and our ability to return cash to our shareholders we can 

make no assurances that our ability to obtain additional financing through the debt markets will not be adversely affected by economic conditions or that we will be able to maintain or improve our current credit ratings

impact of covid19 

​ 

the covid19 coronavirus pandemic continues to have a widespread impact on the global economy as well as our business customers suppliers and other business partners as an essential business in all locations where we operate our stores have generally remained open to serve our customers in responding to the pandemic and its effects the health and safety of our employees and customers remains a priority 

​ 

we expect to continue to be affected although the extent and duration is unknown by the covid19 pandemic and its effects on the economy in a variety of ways including changes in consumer demand whether higher or lower in certain product categories or overall supply chain interruptions or disruptions increased distribution and transportation costs increased product costs and increased payroll expenses we also may experience adverse effects on our business results of operations and cash flows from a recessionary economic environment that may occur after the covid19 pandemic and government response thereto and their effects on the economy has moderated as a result the quarterly cadence of our results of operations which has varied from historical patterns during the pandemic may continue to do so in fiscal 2022 

​ 

due to the significant uncertainty surrounding the covid19 pandemic and its effects there may be consequences that we do not anticipate at this time or that develop in unexpected ways we will continue to monitor the evolving situation and take actions as necessary to serve our employees customers communities and shareholders

executive overview 

​ 

we are the largest discount retailer in the united states by number of stores with 18190 stores located in 47 states as of february 25 2022 with the greatest concentration of stores in the southern southwestern midwestern and eastern united states we offer a broad selection of merchandise including consumable products such as food paper and cleaning products health and beauty products and pet supplies and nonconsumable products such as seasonal merchandise home decor and domestics and basic apparel our merchandise includes national brands from leading manufacturers as well as our own private brand selections with prices at substantial discounts to national brands we offer our customers these national brand and private brand products at everyday low prices typically 10 or less in our convenient smallbox locations

​ 

we believe our convenient store formats locations and broad selection of highquality products at compelling values have driven our substantial growth and financial success over the years and through a variety of economic cycles we are mindful that the majority of our customers are valueconscious and many have low andor fixed incomes as a result we are intensely focused on helping our customers make the most of their spending dollars our core customers are often among the first to be affected by negative or uncertain economic conditions and among the last to feel the effects of improving economic conditions particularly when trends are inconsistent and of an uncertain duration the primary macroeconomic factors that affect our core customers include unemployment and underemployment rates wage growth changes in us and global trade policy and changes to certain government assistance programs such as the supplemental nutrition assistance program “snap” unemployment benefits economic stimulus payments and the child tax credit in fiscal 2020 and 2021 our customers were affected both positively and negatively by many of these factors in connection with the pandemic and its associated impacts we continue to monitor the potential impact of reductions in snap benefits and unemployment benefit programs as well as changes in the payments of the child tax credit although these programs did not result in a material impact on our business or financial results in fiscal 2021 additionally our customers are impacted by increases in those expenses that generally comprise a large portion of their household budgets such as 

rent healthcare and fuel prices as well as cost inflation in frequently purchased household products such as that which we experienced in 2021 and continue to experience as further discussed below finally significant unseasonable or unusual weather patterns can impact customer shopping behaviors 

​ 

we remain committed to our longterm operating priorities as we consistently strive to improve our performance while retaining our customercentric focus these priorities include 1 driving profitable sales growth 2 capturing growth opportunities 3 enhancing our position as a lowcost operator and 4 investing in our diverse teams through development empowerment and inclusion

we seek to drive profitable sales growth through initiatives aimed at increasing customer traffic and average transaction amount as we work to provide everyday low prices and meet our customers’ affordability needs we remain focused on enhancing our margins through effective category management inventory shrink reduction initiatives private brands penetration distribution and transportation efficiencies global sourcing and pricing and markdown optimization several of our strategic and other salesdriving initiatives are also designed to capture growth opportunities and are discussed in more detail below

​ 

historically our sales in our consumables category which tend to have lower gross margins have been the key drivers of net sales and customer traffic while sales in our nonconsumables categories which tend to have higher gross margins have contributed to more profitable sales growth and an increase in average transaction amount prior to 2020 our sales mix had continued to shift toward consumables and within consumables toward lower margin departments such as perishables this trend did not occur in fiscal 2020 or the first quarter of fiscal 2021 as we saw a significant increase in demand in many nonconsumable products including home seasonal and apparel resulting in an overall significant mix shift into nonconsumable categories during those periods beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 and continuing thereafter we began to see some reversion toward the prior mix trends we continue to expect some sales mix challenges to persist and that the mix trend reversion toward consumables will continue several of our initiatives including certain of those discussed below are intended to address these mix challenges however there can be no assurances that these efforts will be successful

​ 

we have also experienced a shift in customer behavior toward trip consolidation as customers shopped our stores less frequently in fiscal 2020 and 2021 than in fiscal 2019 but had a larger average transaction amount we have seen a continuation of these general trends toward trip consolidation and larger transaction amount and there can be no assurance that our sales growth initiatives will be effective at reversing them in addition we believe our sales have been negatively impacted as a result of supply chain disruptions primarily due to lower merchandise instock levels in our stores

​ 

we continue to implement and invest in certain strategic initiatives that we believe will help drive profitable sales growth both with new and existing customers and capture longterm growth opportunities such opportunities include providing our customers with additional shopping access points and even greater convenience by leveraging and developing digital tools and technology such as our dollar general app which contains a variety of tools to enhance the instore shopping experience additionally we launched a partnership with a third party delivery service during 2021 which is now available in more than 10700 stores and we also continue to grow our dg media network which is our platform for connecting brand partners with our customers to drive even greater value for each 

​ 

further our nonconsumables initiative which offers a new differentiated and limited assortment that will change throughout the year continues to contribute to improved overall sales and gross margin performance in stores where it has been deployed we significantly expanded the number of stores with either the full or the “lite” version of our nonconsumables initiative offering in 2021 and plan to complete the rollout in the vast majority of our dollar general stores by the end of fiscal 2022

​ 

additionally in 2020 we introduced popshelf a unique retail concept that incorporates certain of the lessons learned from the nonconsumables initiative in a differentiated format that is focused on categories such as seasonal and home décor health and beauty home cleaning supplies and party and entertainment goods at the end of fiscal 2021 we operated 55 standalone popshelf locations and 25 popshelf storewithinastore concepts within existing dollar general market stores our goal is to operate approximately 155 popshelf locations as well as 

approximately 50 popshelf storewithinastore concepts by the end of fiscal 2022 we believe this concept represents a significant growth opportunity and are targeting approximately 1000 stores by the end of fiscal 2025 

​ 

in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 we completed our rollout of the “dg fresh” initiative a selfdistribution model for frozen and refrigerated products that is designed to reduce product costs enhance item assortment improve our instock position and enhance sales dg fresh contributed to our strong sales performance in 2021 driven by higher instock levels and the introduction of new products in select stores in addition dg fresh benefitted gross profit in 2021 through improved initial markups on inventory purchases which were partially offset by increased distribution and transportation costs dg fresh now wholly or partially serves essentially all stores across the chain and we expect the overall net benefit to our financial results to continue throughout 2022 moving forward we plan to focus on additional optimization of the distribution footprint and product assortment within dg fresh to further drive profitable sales growth 

​ 

to support our other operating priorities we remain focused on capturing growth opportunities in 2021 we opened 1050 new stores remodeled 1752 stores and relocated 100 stores in 2022 we plan to open approximately 1110 new stores including planned popshelf stores and up to ten stores in mexico remodel approximately 1750 stores and relocate approximately 120 stores for a total of 2980 real estate projects we expect stores in mexico which will represent our first store locations outside the united states to open in the second half of 2022 

​ 

we continue to innovate within our channel and are able to utilize the most productive of our various dollar general store formats based on the specific market opportunity we expect store format innovation to allow us to capture additional growth opportunities within our existing markets we recently introduced two new larger format stores approximately 8500 square feet and 9500 square feet respectively and expect the 8500 square foot format along with our existing dollar general plus format of a similar size to become our base prototypes for the majority of new stores replacing our traditional 7300 square foot format and highercooler count dollar general traditional plus format the larger formats allow for expanded highcapacitycooler counts an extended queue line and a broader product assortment including the nonconsumable initiative a larger health and beauty section and produce in select stores we continue to incorporate lessons learned from our various store formats and layouts into our existing store base these lessons contribute to innovation in developing new formats with a goal of driving increased customer traffic average transaction amount samestore sales and overall store productivity 

​ 

we have established a position as a lowcost operator always seeking ways to reduce or control costs that do not affect our customers’ shopping experiences we plan to continue enhancing this position over time while employing ongoing cost discipline to reduce certain expenses as a percentage of sales nonetheless we seek to maintain flexibility to invest in the business as necessary to enhance our longterm competitiveness and profitability 

​ 

we are also deploying “fast track” an initiative aimed at further enhancing our convenience proposition and instock position as well as increasing labor efficiencies within our stores the completed first phase of fast track involved sorting process optimization within our nonrefrigerated distribution centers as well as increased shelfready packaging to allow for greater storelevel stocking efficiencies while the ongoing second phase involves adding a selfcheckout option which we plan to have in up to 11000 stores by the end of fiscal 2022 these and the other strategic initiatives discussed above have required and will require us to incur upfront expenses for which there may not be an immediate return in terms of sales or enhanced profitability 

​ 

certain of our operating expenses such as wage rates and occupancy costs have continued to increase in recent years due primarily to market forces including labor availability increases in minimum wage rates and increases in property rents further federal state andor local minimum wage increases could have a material negative impact on our operating expenses although the magnitude and timing of such impact is uncertain we have experienced incremental payroll distribution and transportation costs related to the covid19 pandemic and its associated impacts we continue to experience materially higher supply chain costs and in some instances shipping delays as a result of shipping capacity shortages port congestion and labor shortages we expect continued inflationary pressures due to higher input costs and higher fuel prices will continue to affect us as well as our vendors and customers including higher commodity transportation and other costs all of which may result in continued pressure to our operating results and their duration is unknown while we expect these challenges to 

persist certain of our initiatives and plans are intended to help offset these challenges however they are somewhat dependent on the scale and timing of the increased costs among other factors there can be no assurance that our mitigation efforts will be successful

​ 

our diverse teams are a competitive advantage and we proactively seek ways to continue investing in their development our goal is to create an environment that attracts develops and retains talented personnel particularly at the store manager level because employees who are promoted from within our company generally have longer tenures and are greater contributors to improvements in our financial performance 

​ 

to further enhance shareholder returns we repurchased shares of our common stock and paid quarterly cash dividends in 2021 we expect to continue our share repurchase activity and to pay quarterly cash dividends for the foreseeable future subject to board discretion and approval

​ 

we utilize key performance indicators “kpis” in the management of our business our kpis include samestore sales average sales per square foot and inventory turnover samestore sales are calculated based upon stores that were open at least 13 full fiscal months and remain open at the end of the reporting period we include stores that have been remodeled expanded or relocated in our samestore sales calculation changes in samestore sales are calculated based on the comparable 52 calendar weeks in the current and prior years the method of calculating samestore sales varies across the retail industry as a result our calculation of samestore sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies average sales per square foot is calculated based on total sales for the preceding 12 months as of the ending date of the reporting period divided by the average selling square footage during the period including the end of the fiscal year the beginning of the fiscal year and the end of each of our three interim fiscal quarters inventory turnover is calculated based on total cost of goods sold for the preceding four quarters divided by the average inventory balance as of the ending date of the reporting period including the end of the fiscal year the beginning of the fiscal year and the end of each of our three interim fiscal quarters each of these measures is commonly used by investors in retail companies to measure the health of the business we use these measures to maximize profitability and for decisions about the allocation of resources

​ 

a continued focus on our four operating priorities as discussed above coupled with pandemicrelated sales and other impacts additional discussion below and strong cash flow management resulted in strong overall operating and financial performance in 2021 as compared to 2020 as set forth below basis points as referred to below are equal to 001 as a percentage of net sales

results of operations 

​ 

accounting periods the following text contains references to years 2021 2020 and 2019 which represent fiscal years ended january 28 2022 january 29 2021 and january 31 2020 respectively our fiscal year ends on the friday closest to january 31 fiscal years 2021 2020 and 2019 were each 52week accounting periods

​ 

seasonality  the nature of our business is somewhat seasonal primarily because of sales of christmasrelated merchandise operating profit in our fourth quarter november december and january has historically been higher than operating profit achieved in each of the first three quarters of the fiscal year expenses and to a greater extent operating profit vary by quarter results of a period shorter than a full year may not be indicative of results expected for the entire year furthermore the seasonal nature of our business may affect comparisons between periods consumer behavior driven by the covid19 pandemic has resulted in a departure from seasonal norms we have experienced in recent years and may continue to disrupt the historical quarterly cadence of our results of operations for an unknown period of time

​ 

the following table contains results of operations data for fiscal years 2021 2020 and 2019 and the dollar and percentage variances among those years

​ 

 ​ 

net sales  the net sales increase in 2021 was primarily due to sales from new stores partially offset by a decrease in samestore sales of 28 compared to 2020 as well as the impact of store closures in 2021 our 16954 samestores accounted for sales of 324 billion the decrease in samestore sales reflects a decline in customer traffic partially offset by an increase in average transaction amount which was driven by higher average item retail prices samestore sales decreased in each of our product categories with the largest percentage decrease in the apparel category 

​ 

the net sales increase in 2020 reflects a samestore sales increase of 163 compared to 2019 in 2020 our 16050 samestores accounted for sales of 319 billion the increase in samestore sales reflects an increase in average transaction amount driven by a significant increase in items per transaction and to a lesser degree higher average item retail prices which were offset in part by a decline in customer traffic samestore sales increased in each of the consumables seasonal home products and apparel categories with the largest percentage increase in the home products category the 2020 net sales increase was positively affected by new stores modestly offset by sales from closed stores

​ 

gross profit in 2021 gross profit increased by 09 and as a percentage of net sales decreased by 16 basis points to 316 compared to 2020 increased transportation costs a greater lifo provision which was driven by higher product costs increased inventory damages and higher distribution costs each contributed to the decrease in the gross profit rate these factors were partially offset by higher inventory markups a reduction in markdowns as a percentage of net sales and a lower inventory shrink rate in 2021 consumables and nonconsumables sales increased at approximately the same rate when compared to 2020 

​ 

in 2020 gross profit increased by 263 and as a percentage of net sales increased by 117 basis points to 318 compared to 2019 a reduction in markdowns as a percentage of net sales and higher initial markups on inventory purchases each contributed to the increase in the gross profit rate in addition nonconsumables sales increased at a higher rate than consumables sales in 2020 which contributed to the increase in the gross profit rate we also experienced a lower rate of inventory shrink in 2020 compared to 2019 these factors were partially offset by increased distribution and transportation costs which were impacted by increased volume some of which was attributable to the covid19 pandemic and discretionary employee bonus expense we believe the effect of the covid19 pandemic on consumer behavior had a significant positive effect on net sales and also had a positive effect on our gross profit in 2020 

​ 

sga sga as a percentage of net sales was 222 in 2021 compared to 212 in 2020 an increase of 96 basis points the primary expenses that were higher as a percentage of net sales in 2021 were retail labor store occupancy costs depreciation and amortization employee benefits utilities and workers’ compensation and general liability expenses partially offset by reductions in discretionary employee bonus and other miscellaneous covidrelated expenses and incentive compensation expenses 

​ 

sga as a percentage of net sales was 212 in 2020 compared to 223 in 2019 a decrease of 106 basis points although we incurred certain incremental costs associated with the covid19 pandemic including discretionary employee bonus expense they were more than offset by the significant increase in net sales during the period as discussed above among the expenses that were a lower percentage of net sales in 2020 were retail labor store occupancy costs utilities and depreciation and amortization in addition we recorded expenses of 310 million in 2019 reflecting our estimate for the settlement of significant legal matters these items were partially offset by 2020 increases in incentive compensation and hurricanerelated expenses 

​ 

interest expense  interest expense increased 71 million to 1575 million in 2021 compared to 2020 and increased 498 million to 1504 million in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to higher average outstanding debt balances in connection with the issuance of debt in the first quarter of 2020 the majority of our debt is fixed rate debt see the detailed discussion under “liquidity and capital resources” regarding the financing of various longterm obligations

​ 

income taxes  the effective income tax rate for 2021 was 217 compared to a rate of 220 for 2020 which represents a net decrease of 03 percentage points the effective income tax rate was lower in 2021 primarily due to increased income tax benefits associated with federal tax credits partially offset by a higher state effective tax rate compared to 2020 

​ 

the effective income tax rate for 2020 was 220 compared to a rate of 222 for 2019 which represents a net decrease of 02 percentage points the effective income tax rate was lower in 2020 primarily due to increased tax benefits associated with sharebased compensation and a larger income tax rate benefit from state taxes offset by a lower income tax rate benefit from federal income tax credits due primarily to higher pretax earnings in 2020 compared to 2019

​ 

effects of inflation 

​ 

in 2021 2020 and 2019 we experienced increases in product costs due in part to the covid19 pandemic and its effect on the global economy particularly to the global supply chain and tariffs on certain items imported from china 

​ 

liquidity and capital resources 

​ 

current financial condition and recent developments 

​ 

during the past three years we have generated an aggregate of approximately 90 billion in cash flows from operating activities and incurred approximately 29 billion in capital expenditures during that period we expanded the number of stores we operate by 2760 representing growth of approximately 18 and we remodeled 

or relocated 4756 stores or approximately 31 of the stores we operated as of the beginning of the threeyear period in 2022 we intend to continue our current strategy of pursuing store growth remodels and relocations

​ 

at january 28 2022 we had a 20 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement the “revolving facility” 40 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes and a commercial paper program that may provide borrowing availability of up to 20 billion at january 28 2022 we had total consolidated outstanding debt including the current portion of longterm obligations of 42 billion most of which was in the form of senior notes all of our material borrowing arrangements are described in greater detail below our borrowing availability under the revolving facility may be effectively limited by our commercial paper notes “cp notes” as further described below the information contained in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii item 8 of this report is incorporated herein by reference 

​ 

we believe our cash flow from operations and our existing cash balances combined with availability under the revolving facility cp notes and access to the debt markets will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our current obligations projected working capital requirements capital spending and anticipated dividend payments for a period that includes the next twelve months as well as the next several years however our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity may be affected by numerous factors many of which are outside of our control depending on our liquidity levels conditions in the capital markets and other factors we may from time to time consider the issuance of debt equity or other securities the proceeds of which could provide additional liquidity for our operations 

​ 

for fiscal 2022 we anticipate potential combined borrowings under the revolving facility and cp notes to be a maximum of approximately 15 billion outstanding at any one time including any anticipated borrowings to fund repurchases of common stock

​ 

revolving credit facility 

​ 

effective december 2 2021 we amended and extended our revolving facility which consists of a 20 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility of which up to 1000 million is available for the issuance of letters of credit and which is scheduled to mature on december 2 2026 

​ 

borrowings under the revolving facility bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable interest rate margin plus at our option either a libor or b a base rate which is usually equal to the prime rate the revolving facility includes customary libor replacement provisions the applicable interest rate margin for borrowings as of january 28 2022 was 1015 for libor borrowings and 0015 for baserate borrowings we must also pay a facility fee payable on any used and unused commitment amounts of the revolving facility and customary fees on letters of credit issued under the revolving facility as of january 28 2022 the facility fee rate was 011 the applicable interest rate margins for borrowings the facility fees and the letter of credit fees under the revolving facility are subject to adjustment from time to time based on our longterm senior unsecured debt ratings 

​ 

the revolving facility contains a number of customary affirmative and negative covenants that among other things restrict subject to certain exceptions our including our subsidiaries’ ability to incur additional liens sell all or substantially all of our assets consummate certain fundamental changes or change in our lines of business and incur additional subsidiary indebtedness the revolving facility also contains financial covenants that require the maintenance of a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio as of january 28 2022 we were in compliance with all such covenants the revolving facility also contains customary events of default 

​ 

as of january 28 2022 under the revolving facility we had no outstanding borrowings outstanding letters of credit of 19 million and borrowing availability of 20 billion that due to our intention to maintain borrowing availability related to the commercial paper program described below could contribute incremental liquidity of 176 billion at january 28 2022 in addition as of january 28 2022 we had outstanding letters of credit of 486 million which were issued pursuant to separate agreements

​ 

commercial paper 

​ 

we may issue the cp notes from time to time in an aggregate amount not to exceed 20 billion outstanding at any time the cp notes may have maturities of up to 364 days from the date of issue and rank equal in right of payment with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness we intend to maintain available commitments under the revolving facility in an amount at least equal to the amount of cp notes outstanding at any time as of january 28 2022 our consolidated balance sheet reflected outstanding unsecured cp notes of 543 million cp notes totaling 1810 million were held by a whollyowned subsidiary and therefore are not reflected in the consolidated balance sheets

​ 

senior notes 

​ 

in april 2013 we issued 9000 million aggregate principal amount of 325 senior notes due 2023 the “2023 senior notes” at a discount of 24 million which are scheduled to mature on april 15 2023 in october 2015 we issued 5000 million aggregate principal amount of 4150 senior notes due 2025 the “2025 senior notes” at a discount of 08 million which are scheduled to mature on november 1 2025 in april 2017 we issued 6000 million aggregate principal amount of 3875 senior notes due 2027 the “2027 senior notes” at a discount of 04 million which are scheduled to mature on april 15 2027 in april 2018 we issued 5000 million aggregate principal amount of 4125 senior notes due 2028 the “2028 senior notes” at a discount of 05 million which are scheduled to mature on may 1 2028 in april 2020 we issued 10 billion aggregate principal amount of 35 senior notes due 2030 the “2030 senior notes” at a discount of 07 million which are scheduled to mature on april 3 2030 and 5000 million aggregate principal amount of 4125 senior notes due 2050 the “2050 senior notes” at a discount of 50 million which are scheduled to mature on april 3 2050 collectively the 2023 senior notes 2025 senior notes 2027 senior notes 2028 senior notes 2030 senior notes and 2050 senior notes comprise the “senior notes” each of which were issued pursuant to an indenture as supplemented and amended by supplemental indentures relating to each series of senior notes as so supplemented and amended the “senior indenture” interest on the 2023 senior notes and the 2027 senior notes is payable in cash on april 15 and october 15 of each year interest on the 2025 and 2028 senior notes is payable in cash on may 1 and november 1 of each year interest on the 2030 and 2050 senior notes is payable in cash on april 3 and october 3 of each year

we may redeem some or all of the senior notes at any time at redemption prices set forth in the senior indenture upon the occurrence of a change of control triggering event which is defined in the senior indenture each holder of our senior notes has the right to require us to repurchase some or all of such holder’s senior notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101 of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest if any to but excluding the repurchase date

​ 

the senior indenture contains covenants limiting among other things our ability subject to certain exceptions to consolidate merge or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets and our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur or guarantee indebtedness secured by liens on any shares of voting stock of significant subsidiaries

​ 

the senior indenture also provides for events of default which if any of them occurs would permit or require the principal of and accrued interest on our senior notes to become or to be declared due and payable as applicable

​ 

rating agencies 

​ 

our senior unsecured debt is rated “baa2” by moody’s with a stable outlook and “bbb” by standard  poor’s with a stable outlook and our commercial paper program is rated “p2” by moody’s and “a2” by standard and poor’s our current credit ratings as well as future rating agency actions could i impact our ability to finance our operations on satisfactory terms ii affect our financing costs and iii affect our insurance premiums and collateral requirements necessary for our selfinsured programs there can be no assurance that we will maintain or improve our current credit ratings

​ 

future cash requirements

share repurchase program 

​ 

our common stock repurchase program had a total remaining authorization of approximately 213 billion at january 28 2022 the authorization allows repurchases from time to time in open market transactions including pursuant to trading plans adopted in accordance with rule 10b51 of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended or in privately negotiated transactions the timing manner and number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including price market conditions compliance with the covenants and restrictions under our debt agreements and other factors the repurchase program has no expiration date and may be modified or terminated from time to time at the discretion of our board of directors for more detail about our share repurchase program see part ii item 5 of this report and note 11 to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii item 8 of this report

​ 

other considerations 

​ 

on march 16 2022 the board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 055 per share which is payable on or before april 19 2022 to shareholders of record of our common stock on april 5 2022 we paid 

quarterly cash dividends of 042 per share in 2021 although the board currently expects to continue regular quarterly cash dividends the declaration and amount of future cash dividends are subject to the board’s sole discretion and will depend upon among other factors our results of operations cash requirements financial condition contractual restrictions and other factors that our board may deem relevant in its sole discretion

​ 

our inventory balance represented approximately 52 of our total assets exclusive of goodwill operating lease assets and other intangible assets as of january 28 2022 our ability to effectively manage our inventory balances can have a significant impact on our cash flows from operations during a given fiscal year inventory purchases are often somewhat seasonal in nature such as the purchase of warmweather or christmasrelated merchandise efficient management of our inventory has been and continues to be an area of focus for us 

​ 

we utilize supply chain finance programs whereby qualifying suppliers may elect at their sole discretion to sell our payment obligations to designated third party financial institutions while the terms of these agreements are between the supplier and the financial institution the supply chain finance financial institutions allow the participating suppliers to utilize our creditworthiness in establishing credit spreads and associated costs as of january 28 2022 the amount due to suppliers participating in these supply chain finance programs was 3282 million

​ 

as described in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements we are involved in a number of legal actions and claims some of which could potentially result in material cash payments adverse developments in those actions could materially and adversely affect our liquidity 

​ 

cash flows 

​ 

cash flows from operating activities cash flows from operating activities were 287 billion in 2021 which represents a 101 billion decrease compared to 2020 as noted above the covid19 pandemic resulted in significantly increased sales gross profit and operating income in 2020 and our net income decreased 2558 million in 2021 compared to 2020 changes in accounts payable resulted in a 987 million increase in our working capital in 2021 compared to a 7456 million increase in 2020 due primarily to the timing of receipts and payments changes in accrued expenses resulted in a 373 million decrease in our working capital in 2021 compared to a 3886 million increase in 2020 due primarily to the timing of accruals and payments for payroll taxes and incentive compensation changes in merchandise inventories resulted in a 5501 million decrease in our working capital in 2021 which was similar to the decrease of 5758 million in 2020 as described in greater detail below changes in income taxes in 2021 compared to 2020 are primarily due to the timing of payments for income taxes

​ 

cash flows from operating activities were 388 billion in 2020 which represents a 164 billion increase compared to 2019 the increased sales gross profit and operating income driven by the covid19 pandemic contributed to the increase in net income of 9425 million in 2020 over 2019 changes in accounts payable resulted in a 7456 million increase in our working capital in 2020 compared to a 4286 million increase in 2019 due primarily to the timing of receipts and payments changes in accrued expenses resulted in a 3886 million increase in our working capital in 2020 compared to a 1003 million increase in 2019 due primarily to increased accruals for incentive compensation and nonincome taxes changes in merchandise inventories resulted in a 5758 million decrease in our working capital in 2020 which was similar to the decrease of 5788 million in 2019 as described in greater detail below changes in income taxes including an increase in cash paid for income taxes in 2020 compared to 2019 are primarily due to the increase in pretax earnings in 2020

​ 

on an ongoing basis we closely monitor and manage our inventory balances and they may fluctuate from period to period based on new store openings the timing of purchases and other factors merchandise inventories increased by 7 in 2021 by 12 in 2020 and by 14 in 2019 inventory levels in the consumables category decreased by 18 million or 0 in 2021 increased by 4556 million or 15 in 2020 and increased by 3719 million or 14 in 2019 the seasonal category increased by 1778 million or 20 in 2021 by 357 million or 4 in 2020 and by 1273 million or 17 in 2019 the home products category increased by 2300 million or 45 in 2021 by 663 million or 15 in 2020 and by 828 million or 23 in 2019 the apparel category decreased by 392 million or 10 in 2021 increased by 129 million or 3 in 2020 and decreased by 21 million or 1 in 2019

​ 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

​ 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “us gaap” requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures in addition to the estimates presented below there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed critical as defined below we believe these estimates are reasonable and appropriate however if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used the resulting changes could have a material effect on the financial statements taken as a whole

​ 

management believes the following policies and estimates are critical because they involve significant judgments assumptions and estimates management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosures presented below relating to those policies and estimates see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of our principal accounting policies

​ 

merchandise inventories  merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market “lcm” with cost determined using the retail last in first out “lifo” method we use the retail inventory method “rim” to calculate gross profit and the resulting valuation of inventories at cost which are computed utilizing a calculated costtoretail inventory ratio to the retail value of sales at an inventory department level we apply the rim to these departments which are groups of products that are fairly uniform in terms of cost selling price relationship and turnover the rim will result in valuing inventories at lcm if permanent markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories inherent in the rim calculation are certain management judgments and estimates that may impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the gross profit recognized these judgments include ensuring departments consist of similar products recording estimated shrinkage between physical inventories and timely recording of markdowns needed to sell inventory 

​ 

we perform an annual lifo analysis whereby all merchandise units are considered for inclusion in the index formulation an actual valuation of inventory under the lifo method is made at the end of each year based on the inventory levels and costs at that time in contrast interim lifo calculations are based on management’s annual estimates of sales the rate of inflation or deflation and yearend inventory levels we also perform analyses for determining obsolete inventory adjusting inventory on a quarterly basis to an lcm value based on various management assumptions including estimated below cost markdowns not yet recorded but required to liquidate such inventory in future periods

​ 

factors considered in the determination of markdowns include current and anticipated demand based on changes in competitors’ practices consumer preferences consumer spending significant weather events and unseasonable weather patterns certain of these factors are outside of our control and may result in greater than estimated markdowns to entice consumer purchases of excess inventory the amount and timing of markdowns may vary significantly from year to year

​ 

we perform physical inventories in virtually all of our stores on an annual basis we calculate our shrink provision based on actual physical inventory results during the fiscal period and an accrual for estimated shrink occurring subsequent to a physical inventory through the end of the fiscal reporting period this accrual is calculated as a percentage of sales at each retail store at a department level based on the store’s most recent historical shrink rate to the extent that subsequent physical inventories yield different results than the estimated accrual our effective shrink rate for a given reporting period will include the impact of adjusting to the actual results 

​ 

we believe our estimates and assumptions related to the application of the rim results in a merchandise inventory valuation that reasonably approximates cost on a consistent basis 

​ 

impairment of longlived assets impairment of longlived assets results when the carrying value of the assets exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows generated by the assets our estimate of undiscounted future store cash flows is based upon historical operations of the stores and estimates of future profitability which encompasses many factors that are subject to variability and are difficult to predict if our estimates of future cash flows are not materially accurate our impairment analysis could be impacted accordingly if a longlived asset is found to be impaired the amount recognized for impairment is equal to the difference between the carrying value and the asset’s estimated fair value the fair value is estimated based primarily upon projected future cash flows discounted at our credit adjusted riskfree rate or other reasonable estimates of fair market value although not currently anticipated changes in these estimates assumptions or projections could materially affect the determination of fair value or impairment

​ 

insurance liabilities  we retain a significant portion of the risk for our workers’ compensation employee health general liability property loss automobile and certain thirdparty landlord claim exposures these represent significant costs primarily due to our large employee base and number of stores provisions are made for these 

liabilities on an undiscounted basis certain of these liabilities are based on actual claim data and estimates of incurred but not reported claims developed using actuarial methodologies based on historical claim trends which have been and are anticipated to continue to be materially accurate if future claim trends deviate from recent historical patterns or other unanticipated events affect the number and significance of future claims we may be required to record additional expenses or expense reductions which could be material to our future financial results

​ 

contingent liabilities – income taxes income tax reserves are determined using the methodology established by accounting standards relating to uncertainty in income taxes these standards require companies to assess each income tax position taken using a twostep process a determination is first made as to whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained based upon the technical merits upon examination by the taxing authorities if the tax position is expected to meet the more likely than not criteria the benefit recorded for the tax position equals the largest amount that is greater than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement of the respective tax position uncertain tax positions require determinations and liabilities to be estimated based on provisions of the tax law which may be subject to change or varying interpretation if our determinations and estimates prove to be inaccurate the resulting adjustments could be material to our future financial results

​ 

lease accounting  lease liabilities are recorded at a discount based upon our estimated collateralized incremental borrowing rate which involves significant judgments and estimates factors incorporated into the calculation of lease discount rates include the valuations and yields of our senior notes their credit spread over comparable us treasury rates and an index of the credit spreads for all north american investment grade companies by rating to determine an indicative secured rate we use the estimated credit spread improvement that would result from an upgrade of one ratings classification by tenor many of our stores are subject to buildtosuit arrangements with landlords which typically carry a primary lease term of up to 15 years with multiple renewal options we also have stores subject to shorterterm leases and many of these leases have renewal options we record single lease expense on a straightline basis over the lease term including any option periods that are reasonably certain to be renewed commencing on the date that we take physical possession of the property from the landlord tenant allowances to the extent received are recorded as a reduction of the right of use asset improvements of leased properties are amortized over the shorter of the life of the applicable lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset 

​ 

sharebased payments  our stock option awards are valued on an individual grant basis using the blackscholesmerton closed form option pricing model we believe that this model fairly estimates the value of our stock option awards the application of this valuation model involves assumptions that are judgmental in the valuation of stock options which affects compensation expense related to these options these assumptions include the term that the options are expected to be outstanding the historical volatility of our stock price applicable interest rates and the dividend yield of our stock other factors involving judgments that affect the expensing of sharebased payments include estimated forfeiture rates of sharebased awards historically these estimates have been materially accurate however if our estimates differ materially from actual experience we may be required to record additional expense or reductions of expense which could be material to our future financial results

​ 

fair value measurements accounting standards for the measurement of fair value of assets and liabilities establish a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity observable inputs that are classified within levels 1 and 2 of the hierarchy and the reporting entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions unobservable inputs classified within level 3 of the hierarchy therefore level 3 inputs are typically based on an entity’s own assumptions as there is little if any related market activity and thus require the use of significant judgment and estimates currently we have no assets or liabilities that are valued based solely on level 3 inputs our fair value measurements are primarily associated with our outstanding debt instruments we use various valuation models in determining the values of these liabilities we believe that in recent years these methodologies have produced materially accurate valuations

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

​ 

financial risk management 

​ 

we are exposed to market risk primarily from adverse changes in interest rates and to a lesser degree commodity prices to minimize this risk we may periodically use financial instruments including derivatives all derivative financial instrument transactions must be authorized and executed pursuant to approval by the board of directors as a matter of policy we do not buy or sell financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes and any such derivative financial instruments are intended to be used to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure our objective is to correlate derivative financial instruments and the underlying exposure being hedged so that fluctuations in the value of the financial instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying economic exposure

​ 

interest rate risk 

​ 

we are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our shortterm borrowings and longterm debt we manage our interest rate risk through the strategic use of fixed and variable interest rate debt and from time to time derivative financial instruments currently we are counterparty to certain interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of 3500 million entered into in may 2021 these swaps are scheduled to mature in april 2030 under the terms of these agreements we swapped fixed interest rates on a portion of our 2030 senior notes for threemonth libor rates in recent years our principal interest rate exposure has been from outstanding borrowings under our revolving facility as well as our commercial paper program as of january 28 2022 we had 543 million of consolidated commercial paper borrowings and no borrowings outstanding under our revolving facility for a detailed discussion of our revolving facility and our commercial paper program see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements 

​ 

a change in interest rates on variable rate debt impacts our pretax earnings and cash flows whereas a change in interest rates on fixed rate debt impacts the economic fair value of debt but not our pretax earnings and cash flows at january 28 2022 our primary interest rate exposure was from changes in interest rates which affect our variable rate debt based on our outstanding variable rate debt as of january 28 2022 after giving consideration to our interest rate swap agreements the annualized effect of a one percentage point increase in variable interest rates would have resulted in a pretax reduction of our earnings and cash flows of approximately 41 million in 2021

​ 

at january 29 2021 our primary interest rate exposure was from changes in interest rates on our variable rate investment holdings which were classified as cash and cash equivalents in our consolidated financial statements the increase in cash and cash equivalents was driven primarily by our issuance of 15 billion of senior unsecured notes during the first quarter of 2020 as we sought to strengthen liquidity as a result of the uncertainty caused by the covid19 pandemic based on our variable rate cash investment balance of 11 billion at january 29 2021 the annualized effect of a 01 percentage point decrease in interest rates would have resulted in a pretax reduction of our earnings and cash flows of approximately 11 million in 2020

​ 

covid19 pandemic 

​ 

throughout 2020 the covid19 coronavirus pandemic resulted in widespread and continuing impacts on the global economy and has affected our business as well as our customers suppliers and other business partners in early march 2020 we began seeing heightened demand from customers particularly for consumable products such as paper food and cleaning products shortly thereafter we also saw a significant increase in demand for many nonconsumable products including home seasonal and apparel resulting in a significant overall mix shift into nonconsumable categories we have also seen a shift in customer behavior toward trip consolidation as customers are shopping our stores less frequently than in the same period in 2019 but purchased a larger average basket amount to address the increased demand we increased our hiring of new store associates and worked with suppliers to incorporate new items in stores to meet the essential needs of customers while addressing certain product shortages and vendor allocation limitations we incurred significant incremental expenses related to the pandemic including appreciation bonuses for retail distribution and transportation employees as well as for health and safety measures we expect to continue to be affected although the extent and duration is unknown by the covid19 pandemic and its effects on the economy in a variety of ways potentially including changing consumer demand whether higher or lower overall and in certain product categories supply chain interruptions increased distribution and transportation costs and increased costs in an effort to maintain safe work and shopping environments 

​ 

our business model 

​ 

our long history of profitable growth is founded on a commitment to a relatively simple business model providing a broad base of customers with their basic everyday and household needs supplemented with a variety of general merchandise items at everyday low prices in conveniently located smallbox stores we continually evaluate the needs and demands of our customers and modify our merchandise selections and pricing accordingly while remaining focused on increasing profitability cash generation and returns for our shareholders

​ 

our longterm operating priorities are 1 driving profitable sales growth 2 capturing growth opportunities 3 enhancing our position as a lowcost operator and 4 investing in our diverse teams through development empowerment and inclusion  for more information on these operating priorities see the “executive 

overview” section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in part ii item 7 of this report 

​ 

in 2020 we achieved our 31st consecutive year of positive samestore sales growth we believe that this growth which has taken place in a variety of economic conditions is a result of our compelling value and convenience proposition although no assurances can be given that we will continue to achieve positive samestore sales growth in any given year and we currently believe it is unlikely that we will achieve positive samestore sales growth in 2021 as a result of the unusually high sales results we experienced in 2020 

​ 

compelling value and convenience proposition our ability to deliver highly competitive prices in convenient locations and our easy “in and out” shopping format create a compelling shopping experience that we believe distinguishes us from other discount retailers as well as convenience drug grocery online and mass merchant retailers our slogan “save time save money every day” ® summarizes our appeal to customers we believe our ability to effectively deliver both value and convenience allows us to succeed in small markets with limited shopping alternatives as well as in larger and more competitive markets our value and convenience proposition is evidenced by the following attributes of our business model

​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

substantial growth opportunities we believe we have substantial longterm growth potential in the us and we have identified significant opportunities to add new stores in both existing and new markets in addition we have opportunities to relocate or remodel locations within our existing store base to better serve our customers our attractive store economics including a relatively low initial investment and simple lowcost operating model and our variety of store formats have allowed us to grow our store base to current levels and provide us significant opportunities to continue our profitable store growth strategy 

​ 

our merchandise 

​ 

we offer a focused assortment of everyday necessities which we believe helps to drive frequent customer visits and key items in a broad range of general merchandise categories our product assortment provides the opportunity for our customers to address most of their basic shopping needs with one trip we offer a wide selection of nationally advertised brands from leading manufacturers additionally our private brand products offer even greater value with options to purchase both products that are of comparable quality to national brands as well as opening price point items each at substantial discounts to the national brands

​ 

consumables is our largest merchandise category and includes paper and cleaning products such as paper towels bath tissue paper dinnerware trash and storage bags disinfectants and laundry packaged food such as cereals canned soups and vegetables condiments spices sugar and flour perishables such as milk eggs bread refrigerated and frozen food beer and wine snacks such as candy cookies crackers salty snacks and carbonated beverages health and beauty such as overthecounter medicines and personal care products including soap body wash shampoo cosmetics dental hygiene and foot care products pet such as pet supplies and pet food and tobacco products

​

​ 

home products include kitchen supplies cookware small appliances light bulbs storage containers frames candles craft supplies and kitchen bed and bath soft goods

​ 

apparel includes casual everyday apparel for infants toddlers girls boys women and men as well as socks underwear disposable diapers shoes and accessories

​ 

the percentage of net sales of each of our four categories of merchandise for the fiscal years indicated below was as follows

​ 

 ​ 

our seasonal and home products categories typically account for the highest gross profit margins and the consumables category typically accounts for the lowest gross profit margin

​ 

the dollar general store 

​ 

the typical dollar general store is operated by a store manager one or more assistant store managers and three or more sales associates our stores generally feature a lowcost no frills building with limited maintenance capital low operating costs and a focused merchandise offering within a broad range of categories allowing us to deliver low retail prices while generating strong cash flows and capital investment returns our stores average approximately 7400 square feet of selling space and approximately 75 of our stores are located in towns of 20000 or fewer people we generally have had good success in locating suitable store sites in the past and we believe that there is ample opportunity for new store growth in existing and new markets in addition we believe we have significant opportunities available for our relocation and remodel programs

​ 

our store growth over the past three years is summarized in the following table

​ 

 ​ 

our customers 

​ 

our customers seek value and convenience depending on their financial situation and geographic proximity customers’ reliance on dollar general varies from fillin shopping to making periodic trips to stock up on household items to making weekly or more frequent trips to meet most essential needs we generally locate our stores and plan our merchandise selections to best serve the needs of our core customers the low and fixed income households often underserved by other retailers and we are focused on helping them make the most of their 

spending dollars at the same time however dollar general shoppers from a wide range of income brackets and life stages appreciate our quality merchandise as well as our attractive value and convenience proposition

​ 

our suppliers 

​ 

we purchase merchandise from a wide variety of suppliers and maintain direct buying relationships with many producers of national brand merchandise despite our broad offering we maintain only a limited number of items per category allowing us to keep our average costs low our three largest suppliers accounted for approximately 9 8 and 8 respectively of our purchases in 2020 our private brands come from a wide variety of suppliers we directly imported approximately 5 of our purchases at cost in 2020 

​ 

in 2020 covid19 caused disruptions in our supply chain making it more difficult to obtain certain products in sufficient quantities to meet customer demand and increasing distribution and transportation costs we anticipate these covid19 effects to persist to some degree through at least the first half of 2021 although the ultimate extent and duration of the covid19 pandemic and its effects are unknown prior to 2020 we have generally been able to obtain sufficient quantities of core merchandise and in cases where one or more of our current sources of supply became unavailable we generally have been able to obtain alternative sources alternative sources could increase our merchandise costs and supply chain lead time and expenses result in a temporary reduction in store inventory levels reduce our selection or reduce the quality of our merchandise and an inability to obtain alternative sources could adversely affect our sales 

​ 

distribution and transportation 

​ 

our stores are currently supported by distribution centers for both refrigerated and nonrefrigerated merchandise located strategically throughout our geographic footprint we lease additional temporary warehouse space as necessary to support our distribution needs in addition to our traditional distribution centers we now operate multiple temperaturecontrolled distribution facilities in support of “dg fresh” our strategic multiphased shift to selfdistribution of frozen and refrigerated goods such as dairy deli and frozen products we regularly analyze and rebalance the network to ensure that it remains efficient and provides the service levels our stores require see “—properties” below for additional information pertaining to our distribution centers

​ 

most of our merchandise flows through our distribution centers and is delivered to our stores by our private fleet and by thirdparty trucking firms utilizing our trailers in addition vendors or thirdparty distributors deliver or ship certain food items and other merchandise directly to our stores

​ 

seasonality 

​ 

the nature of our business is somewhat seasonal generally our operating profit has been greater in the fourth quarter which includes the christmas selling season as compared with operating profit in each of the first three quarters of our fiscal year in addition our quarterly results can be affected by the timing of certain holidays new store openings remodels relocations and store closings consumer behavior driven by the covid19 pandemic has resulted in a departure from seasonal norms we have experienced in recent years and may continue to disrupt the historical quarterly cadence of our results of operations for an unknown period of time

​ 

our competition 

​ 

we operate in the basic discount consumer goods market which is highly competitive with respect to price customers store location merchandise quality assortment and presentation service offerings instock consistency customer service promotional activity employees and market share we compete with discount stores and many other retailers including mass merchandise warehouse club grocery drug convenience variety online and certain specialty stores these other retail companies operate stores in many of the areas where we operate and many of them engage in extensive advertising and marketing efforts our direct competitors include family dollar dollar tree big lots 99 cents only and various local independent operators as well as walmart target kroger aldi walgreens cvs and rite aid among others certain of our competitors have greater financial distribution marketing and other resources than we do and may be able to secure better arrangements from suppliers than we 

can competition is intense and we believe it will continue to be so with certain competitors reducing their store locations while others move into or increase their presence in our geographic and product markets and increase the availability of mobile webbased and other digital technology to facilitate a more convenient and competitive customer online and instore shopping experience

​ 

we believe that we differentiate ourselves from other forms of retailing by offering consistently low prices in a convenient smallstore format we are able to maintain competitive prices due in part to our lowcost operating structure and the relatively limited assortment of products offered purchasing large volumes of merchandise within our focused assortment in each merchandise category allows us to keep our average product costs low contributing to our ability to offer competitive everyday low prices to our customers see “—our business model” above for further discussion of our competitive situation

​ 

our intellectual property 

​ 

we own marks that are registered with the united states patent and trademark office and are protected under applicable intellectual property laws including without limitation dollar general® dg® clover valley® and trueliving® along with variations and formatives of these trademarks we attempt to obtain registration of our trademarks whenever practicable and to pursue vigorously any infringement of those marks our trademark registrations have various expiration dates however assuming that the trademark registrations are properly renewed they have a perpetual duration we also hold an exclusive license to the rexall brand through at least march 5 2029 and the believe beauty brand through at least march 23 2022

​ 

develop 

​ 

as a testament to our employee development efforts in february 2021 we were inducted into training magazine’s hall of fame following two consecutive years as the magazine’s top training and development program and rounding out 10 consecutive years among its top 100 list in 2020 we estimate we invested nearly three million training hours in our employees to promote their education and development 

​ 

our internal promotion rate helps us measure the success of our development programs as of february 26 2021 we employed approximately 158000 fulltime and parttime employees including divisional and regional 

managers district managers store managers other store personnel and distribution center and administrative personnel as of the end of 2020 approximately 73 of store managers and thousands of additional employees including several members of our senior leadership have been promoted from within our organization

​ 

to ensure we are creating an environment where our employees feel respected safe empowered and motivated we regularly monitor retention and engagement levels across the organization through a variety of means working to understand what is important to our workforce and how we can best continue to meet their evolving needs 

​ 

compliance with governmental regulations 

​ 

our operations are subject to the applicable federal state local and foreign laws rules and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate or conduct business these laws rules and regulations relate to among other things the sale of products including without limitation product and food safety marketing and labeling information security and privacy labor and employment employee wages and benefits health and safety real property public accommodations antibribery financial reporting and disclosure antitrust and fair competition anti money laundering transportation imports and customs intellectual property taxes and environmental compliance

​ 

although we routinely incur significant costs in complying with the laws and regulations applicable to the company and we can make no guarantees that future such costs will not be material to date compliance with these laws rules and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position many of our entrylevel store employees are paid at rates in line with the applicable minimum wage and consequently in certain situations increases to such wage rates have increased our labor costs if federal state andor local minimum wage rates were to increase significantly andor rapidly compliance with such increases could adversely affect our earnings additionally if significant changes in the corporate tax rate occur in the future such change could adversely affect our overall effective tax rate and earnings see “risk factors” in part i item 1a for additional information regarding government regulations that could impact our business

 item 1a risk factors 

investment in our company involves risks you should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information in this report and other filings that we make from time to time with the sec including our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations or liquidity these risks are not the only risks we face our business financial condition results of operations or liquidity could also be adversely affected by additional factors that apply to all companies generally or by risks not currently known to us or that we currently view to be immaterial we can provide no assurance and make no representation that our risk mitigation efforts although we believe they are reasonable will be successful

business strategic and competitive risks 

the covid19 pandemic has continued to impact our business financial performance and financial condition and could have a material adverse impact on our business financial performance and financial condition in the future 

the covid19 pandemic has resulted in widespread and continuing adverse impacts on and volatility in the global economy and has continued to impact our business employees customers suppliers and other business partners considerable uncertainty exists regarding the extent to which the covid19 pandemic will continue as well as the scope duration and effectiveness of measures directed at containment and mitigation of the virus including travel bans and restrictions quarantines shelterinplace orders school closures vaccination rollouts and business and government restrictions and shutdowns these measures taken by national state and local government authorities to date have resulted in high levels of unemployment are expected to have serious adverse impacts on domestic and foreign economies and could have a significant adverse impact on our core customer and her spending for an unknown length of time the potential effect of economic stabilization efforts including additional government stimulus payments foodnutrition assistance and enhanced unemployment benefits is uncertain if customer spending on the goods we sell declines as a result of some or all of these factors there could be a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations

we have been classified as an essential business in all locations where we operate and as such our stores generally have remained open to serve our customers while none of the below has resulted in a material adverse impact on our business financial performance or financial condition to date we have experienced or are experiencing certain effects of the covid19 pandemic including but not limited to the following



 depending on the duration and severity of the covid19 pandemic including whether there are additional “waves” other additional periods of increases or spikes in the number of covid19 cases or mutations thereof and the availability acceptance and efficacy of medical treatments and vaccines which are uncertain and cannot be predicted as well as governmental authorities’ responses and requirements related to the pandemic including the pace and extent of the easing or removal of restrictions on businesses and customers when the pandemic does subside or the reinstitution of more stringent regulations before the pandemic subsides these experienced effects could have a material adverse impact on our business financial performance and financial condition in the future if they increase in number duration andor magnitude we also could experience other effects that could aggravate or increase the likelihood of the risk factors set forth herein andor result in a material adverse impact on our business financial performance or financial condition including but not limited to the financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers or business partners including the financial failure of one or more of our international steamship line vendors resulting in our inability to obtain our purchased goods in their possession increased operating costs as a result of increased government regulations and mandates requiring us to provide wage increases or premiums to frontline employees eg those imposed in certain counties in california and elsewhere personal protective equipment or personal hygiene supplies to customers or to increase store and distribution center cleaning protocols as well as increased store andor distribution center closures as a result of increased government enforcement of any such new regulations and mandates increased litigation expenses resulting from employee or customer lawsuits including those related to the company’s covid19 response and alleged employee or customer contraction increased insurance costs medical claims costs and workers’ compensation claim costs and the impact of regulatory and judicial changes in liability for workers’ compensation and damage to our reputation if our response to the covid19 pandemic is perceived as inadequate or inappropriate additionally the covid19 pandemic may cause or accelerate a shift in our core customer’s behaviors expectations and shopping trends which could result in lost sales and market share if we are not able to successfully increase the pace of our strategic initiatives development particularly our digital strategic initiatives and if our current digital shopping offerings do not continue to compete effectively 

the extent to which the covid19 pandemic ultimately impacts our business financial performance and financial condition will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including but not limited to the duration and spread of the outbreak and any variants thereof its severity the actions to contain and mitigate the virus or treat its impact and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume as a result we may not be able to identify all risks ultimately faced from the covid19 pandemic and its aftermath

economic factors may reduce our customers’ spending impair our ability to execute our strategies and initiatives and increase our costs and expenses which could result in materially decreased sales or profitability 

many of our customers have fixed or low incomes and limited discretionary spending dollars any factor that could adversely affect their disposable income could decrease our customers’ spending or cause them to shift their spending to our lower margin product choices which could result in materially decreased sales andor profitability factors that could reduce our customers’ disposable income include but are not limited to high unemployment or underemployment levels or decline in real wages inflation pandemics such as the covid19 pandemic higher fuel energy healthcare and housing costs interest rates consumer debt levels and tax rates tax law changes that negatively affect credits and refunds lack of available credit and decreases in or elimination of government subsidies such as unemployment and foodnutrition assistance programs

many of the economic factors listed above as well as commodity rates transportation lease and insurance costs wage rates including the heightened possibility of increased federal state andor local minimum wage rates foreign exchange rate fluctuations measures that create barriers to or increase the costs of international trade 

including increased import duties or tariffs changes in applicable laws and regulations including tax laws related to the corporate tax rate and other economic factors also could impair our ability to successfully execute our strategies and initiatives as well as increase our cost of goods sold and selling general and administrative expenses including real estate costs and may have other adverse consequences that we are unable to fully anticipate or control all of which may materially decrease our sales or profitability 

our plans depend significantly on strategies and initiatives designed to increase sales and profitability and improve the efficiencies costs and effectiveness of our operations and failure to achieve or sustain these plans could materially affect our results of operations 

we have shortterm and longterm strategies and initiatives such as those relating to merchandising real estate and new store development store formats and concepts digital shrink sourcing private brand inventory management supply chain store operations expense reduction and technology in various stages of testing evaluation and implementation which are designed to continue to improve our results of operations and financial condition the effectiveness of these initiatives is inherently uncertain even when tested successfully and is dependent on consistency of training and execution workforce stability ease of execution and scalability and the absence of offsetting factors that can influence results adversely the number and diverse geographic locations of our stores and distribution centers and our decentralized field management also contribute to the challenging nature of these factors other risk factors described herein also could negatively affect general implementation failure to achieve successful or costeffective implementation of our initiatives could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition

the success of our merchandising initiatives particularly our nonconsumable initiatives and efforts to increase sales of higher margin products within the consumables category further depends in part upon our ability to predict the products that our customers will demand and to identify and timely respond to evolving trends in consumer preferences and demographic mixes in our markets if we are unable to select and timely obtain products that are attractive to customers and at costs that allow us to sell them at an acceptable profit or to effectively market such products it could result in materially decreased sales and profitability 

the success of our cold chain selfdistribution initiative dg fresh further depends in part on our ability to effectively transition these distribution operations from our current service providers without business disruption as well as on the availability of certain supply chain resources including temperaturecontrolled distribution centers refrigerated transportation equipment and drivers the success of our fast track initiative which is designed to enhance our instore labor productivity onshelf availability and customer convenience further depends in part on successful implementation and maintenance of the necessary technology customer interest and adoption of selfcheckout our ability to gain cost efficiencies and control shrink levels from the initiative and vendor cooperation

we face intense competition that could limit our growth opportunities and materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

the retail business is highly competitive with respect to price customers store location merchandise quality product assortment and presentation service offerings instock consistency customer service ease of shopping experience promotional activity employees and market share we compete with discount stores and many other retailers including mass merchandise warehouse club grocery drug convenience variety online retailers and certain specialty stores to maintain our competitive position we may be required to lower prices either temporarily or permanently and may have limited ability to increase prices in response to increased costs resulting in lower margins and reduced profitability certain of our competitors have greater financial distribution marketing and other resources and may be able to secure better arrangements with suppliers than we 

competition is intense and is expected to continue to be so with certain competitors reducing their store locations while others enter or increase their presence in our geographic and product markets including through the expansion of availability of delivery services and expand availability of mobile webbased and other digital technologies to facilitate a more convenient and competitive online and instore shopping experience if our competitors or others were to enter our industry in a significant way including through alliances or other business combinations it could significantly alter the competitive dynamics of the retail marketplace and result in 

competitors with greatly improved competitive positions which could materially affect our financial performance our ability to effectively compete will depend substantially upon our continued ability to develop and execute compelling and costeffective strategies and initiatives if we fail to anticipate or respond effectively to competitive pressures and industry changes it could materially affect our results of operations and financial condition

operational risks 

if we cannot timely and costeffectively execute our real estate projects and meet our financial expectations or if we do not anticipate or successfully address the challenges imposed by our expansion including into new states or urban areas it could materially impede our planned future growth and our profitability 

delays in or failure to complete a significant portion of our real estate projects or failure to meet our financial expectations for these projects could materially and adversely affect our growth and our profitability our ability to timely open relocate and remodel profitable stores and expand into additional market areas is a key component of our planned future growth and may depend in part on the availability of suitable store locations and capital funding the absence of entitlement process or occupancy delays including zoning restrictions and moratoria on small box discount retail development such as those passed by certain local governments in areas where we operate or seek to operate which to date have not materially impaired our ability to complete our planned real estate projects or growth the ability to negotiate acceptable lease and development terms for example real estate development requirements and cost of building materials and labor to costeffectively hire and train qualified new personnel especially store managers and to identify and accurately assess sufficient customer demand and general economic conditions 

we also may not anticipate or successfully address all of the challenges imposed by the expansion of our operations including into new states or urban areas where we have limited or no meaningful experience or brand recognition those areas may have different competitive and market conditions consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns than our existing markets as well as higher cost of entry and operating costs these factors may cause our new stores to be less profitable than stores in our existing markets which could slow future growth in these areas in addition many new stores will be located in areas where we have existing stores which inadvertently may temporarily or permanently divert a larger than anticipated number of customers and sales from our existing stores thereby adversely affecting our overall financial performance

inventory shrinkage may negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we experience significant inventory shrinkage although some level of inventory shrinkage is an unavoidable cost of doing business higher rates of inventory shrinkage or increased security or other costs to combat inventory theft could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to contain or reduce inventory shrinkage

our cash flows from operations profitability and financial condition may be negatively affected if we are not successful in managing our inventory balances 

our inventory balance represented approximately 48 of our total assets exclusive of goodwill operating lease assets and other intangible assets as of january 29 2021 efficient inventory management is a key component of our business success and profitability we must maintain sufficient inventory levels and an appropriate product mix to meet our customers’ demands without allowing those levels to increase such that the costs to store and hold the goods unduly impacts our financial results or increases the risk of inventory shrinkage if we do not accurately predict customer trends spending levels or price sensitivity we may have to take unanticipated markdowns to dispose of the excess inventory which also can adversely affect our financial results we continue to focus on ways to reduce these risks but we cannot make assurances that we will be successful in our inventory management if we are not successful in managing our inventory balances our cash flows from operations and financial condition may be negatively affected

failure to maintain the security of our business customer employee or vendor information or to comply with privacy laws could expose us to litigation government enforcement actions and costly response measures and could materially harm our reputation and affect our business and financial performance 

in connection with sales we transmit confidential credit and debit card information which is encrypted using pointtopoint encryption we also have access to collect or maintain certain private or confidential information regarding our customers employees and their dependents and vendors as well as our business some of this information is stored electronically in connection with our ecommerce and mobile applications some of which may leverage thirdparty service providers additionally we may share information with select vendors that assist us in conducting our business while we have implemented procedures and technology intended to protect such information and require appropriate controls of our vendors external attackers could compromise such controls and result in unauthorized disclosure of such information as attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated may include attacks on our thirdparty business partners and do not always or immediately produce detectable indicators of compromise moreover inadvertent or malicious internal personnel actions could result in a defeat of security measures and a compromise of our or our thirdparty vendors’ information systems like other retailers we and our vendors have experienced threats to and infrequent immaterial incidents involving data and systems including by perpetrators of attempted random or targeted malicious attacks computer malware ransomware bots or other destructive or disruptive software and attempts to misappropriate our information and cause system failures and disruptions if attackers obtain customer employee or vendor passwords through unrelated thirdparty breaches and if impacted customers employees or vendors do not employ good online security practices eg use the same password across different sites these passwords could be used to gain access to their information or accounts with us in certain situations

because we accept debit and credit cards for payment we are subject to industry data protection standards and protocols such as the payment card industry data security standards issued by the payment card industry security standards council nonetheless we may be vulnerable to and unable to detect and appropriately respond to cardholder data security breaches and data loss including successful attacks on applications systems or networks 

a significant security breach of any kind experienced by us or one of our vendors which could be undetected for a period of time or a significant failure by us or one of our vendors to comply with applicable privacy and information security laws regulations and standards could expose us to risks of data loss litigation government enforcement actions fines or penalties credit card brand assessments negative publicity and reputational harm business disruption and costly response measures eg providing notification to and credit monitoring services for affected individuals as well as further upgrades to our security measures which may not be covered by or may exceed the coverage limits of our insurance policies and could materially disrupt our operations any resulting negative publicity could significantly harm our reputation which could cause us to lose market share as a result of customers discontinuing the use of our ecommerce and mobile applications or debit or credit cards in our stores or not shopping in our stores altogether and could materially and adversely affect our business and financial performance

material damage or interruptions to our information systems as a result of external factors staffing shortages or challenges in maintaining or updating our existing technology or developing or implementing new technology could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we depend on a variety of information technology systems including systems owned and managed by thirdparty vendors for the efficient functioning of our business including without limitation transaction processing and the management of our employees facilities logistics inventories stores and customerfacing digital applications and operations our technology initiatives may not deliver desired results or may do so on a delayed schedule additionally such systems are subject to damage or interruption from power surges and outages facility damage physical theft computer and telecommunications failures inadequate or ineffective redundancy malicious code including malware ransomware or similar successful attacks eg account compromise phishing denial of service and application network or system vulnerability exploitation software upgrade failures or code defects natural disasters and human error design defects damage to or interruption to these systems may require a 

significant investment to repair or replace disrupt our operations result in the loss or corruption of critical data and harm our reputation all of which could materially and adversely affect our business or results of operations

we also rely heavily on our information technology staff failure to meet these staffing needs may negatively affect our ability to fulfill our technology initiatives while continuing to provide maintenance on existing systems we rely on third parties to maintain and periodically upgrade many of these systems so that they can continue to support our business we license the software programs supporting many of our systems from independent software developers the inability of these vendors developers or us to continue to maintain and upgrade these systems and software programs could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations or retain vulnerability exploitation risk if we were unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner and could expose us to greater risk of a successful attack in addition costs and delays associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology including the migration of applications to the cloud or our current implementation of our new point of sale system with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems also could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations fail to operate as designed result in the potential loss or corruption of data or information disrupt operations and affect our ability to meet business and reporting requirements and adversely affect our profitability

a significant disruption to our distribution network the capacity of our distribution centers or the timely receipt of inventory could adversely affect sales or increase our transportation costs which would decrease our profitability 

we rely on our distribution and transportation network to provide goods to our stores timely and costeffectively using various transportation modes including ocean rail and truck we and our vendors move goods from vendor locations to our distribution centers and our stores any disruption unanticipated or unusual expense or operational failure related to this process eg delivery delays including as a result of pandemic outbreaks or increases in transportation costs such as those we have experienced in fiscal 2020 and continue to experience including increased fuel costs import freight costs carrier or driver wages as a result of driver shortages a decrease in transportation capacity for overseas shipments or port closures labor shortages or work stoppages or slowdowns could negatively impact sales and profits labor shortages or work stoppages in the transportation industry or disruptions to the national and international transportation infrastructure that necessitate our securing alternative labor or shipping suppliers could also increase our costs or otherwise negatively affect our business the covid19 pandemic disrupted the global and domestic transportation and distribution of goods and resulted in product delivery delays and higher delivery prices the supply chain disruptions that we have experienced to date as a result of the covid19 pandemic did not have a material negative impact on our financial results in fiscal 2020 however depending on the continued extent and duration of the covid19 pandemic our distribution network results of operations including sales or future business may be materially and adversely impacted 

we maintain a network of distribution facilities and are moving forward with plans to build or lease new facilities to support our growth objectives and strategic initiatives delays in opening such facilities could adversely affect our financial performance by slowing store growth or the rollout of certain strategic initiatives such as our dg fresh initiative which may in turn reduce revenue growth or by increasing transportation and product costs in addition distributionrelated construction or expansion projects entail risks that could cause delays and cost overruns such as shortages of materials or skilled labor work stoppages unforeseen construction scheduling engineering environmental or geological problems weather interference fires or other casualty losses and unanticipated cost increases for these reasons the completion date and ultimate cost of these projects could differ significantly from initial expectations and we cannot guarantee that any project will be completed on time or within established budgets

risks associated with or faced by our suppliers could adversely affect our financial performance 

we source our merchandise from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers and we depend on them to supply merchandise in a timely and efficient manner in 2020 our largest supplier accounted for approximately 9 of our purchases and our second and third largest suppliers each accounted for approximately 8 of our purchases if one or more of our current sources of supply became unavailable we believe we generally 

would be able to obtain alternative sources but it could increase our merchandise costs and supply chain lead time result in a temporary reduction in store inventory levels and reduce the selection and quality of our merchandise an inability to obtain alternative sources could materially decrease our sales additionally if a supplier fails to deliver on its commitments we could experience merchandise outofstocks that could lead to lost sales and reputational harm further failure of suppliers to meet our compliance protocols could prolong our procurement lead time resulting in lost sales and adverse margin impact

we directly imported approximately 5 of our purchases measured at cost in 2020 but many of our domestic vendors directly import their products or components of their products changes to the prices and flow of these goods often are for reasons beyond our control such as political or civil unrest acts of war currency fluctuations disruptions in maritime lanes port labor disputes economic conditions and instability in countries in which foreign suppliers are located the financial instability of suppliers failure to meet our terms and conditions or our standards issues with our suppliers’ labor practices or labor problems they may experience such as strikes stoppages or slowdowns which could also increase labor costs during and following the disruption the availability and cost of raw materials pandemic outbreaks merchandise quality or safety issues transport availability and cost increases in wage rates and taxes transport security inflation and other factors relating to suppliers and the countries in which they are located or from which they import such changes could adversely affect our operations and profitability 

while we are working to diversify our sources of imported goods a substantial amount of our imported merchandise comes from china and thus a change in the chinese leadership the effects of pandemic outbreaks including covid19 economic and market conditions internal economic stimulus actions or currency or other policies as well as trade relations between china and the united states and increases in costs of labor could negatively impact our merchandise costs we experienced delays in the receipt of certain goods from international and domestic shipping origins as a result of the covid19 pandemic in fiscal 2020 but these pandemicrelated supply chain disruptions did not have a material negative impact on our financial results in fiscal 2020 depending on the continued extent and duration of the covid19 pandemic our supply chain results of operations including sales or future business may be materially and adversely impacted in addition the united states’ foreign trade policies duties tariffs and other impositions on imported goods trade sanctions imposed on certain countries particularly china import limitations on certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade and port labor agreements are beyond our control these and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our business and financial performance if we increase our product imports from foreign vendors the risks associated with these imports also will increase and we may be exposed to additional or different risks as we increase imports of goods produced in countries other than china

natural disasters and unusual weather conditions whether or not caused by climate change pandemic outbreaks or other health crises political or civil unrest acts of violence or terrorism and disruptive global political events could disrupt business and result in lower sales and otherwise adversely affect our financial performance 

the occurrence of one or more natural disasters such as hurricanes fires floods tornadoes and earthquakes unusual weather conditions pandemic outbreaks or other health crises including but not limited to the covid19 pandemic political or civil unrest acts of violence or terrorism including within our stores distribution centers or other company property or disruptive global political events or similar disruptions could adversely affect our reputation business and financial performance if any of these events result in the closure or a limitation on operating hours of one or more of our distribution centers a significant number of stores our sourcing offices our corporate headquarters or data center or impact one or more of our key suppliers our operations and financial performance could be materially and adversely affected through an inability or reduced ability to make deliveries process payroll or provide other support functions to our stores and through lost sales these events also could affect consumer shopping patterns or prevent customers from reaching our stores which could lead to lost sales and higher markdowns eg during our first accounting period of fiscal 2021 we lost approximately 8400 store operating days as a result of closures due to winter weather across the united states or result in increases in fuel or other energy prices fuel shortages new store or distribution center opening delays the temporary lack of an adequate work force in a market the temporary or longterm disruption of product availability in our stores the temporary or long

term inability to obtain or access technology needed to effectively run our business disruption of our utility services or information systems and damage to our reputation these events may also increase the costs of insurance if they result in significant loss of property or other insurable damage by us or in the market more generally

product liability product recall or other product safety or labeling claims could adversely affect our business reputation and financial performance 

we are dependent on our vendors to ensure that the products we buy from them comply with applicable product safety and labeling laws and regulations and to inform us of all applicable restrictions on the sale of such products nonetheless product liability personal injury or other claims may be asserted against us relating to product contamination tampering expiration mislabeling recall and other safety or labeling issues including those relating to products that we may selfdistribute through our dg fresh initiative

we seek but may not be successful in obtaining contractual indemnification and insurance coverage for productrelated claims and issues from our vendors if we do not have adequate contractual indemnification or insurance available or our vendors fails to adhere to their obligations to us such claims could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations our ability to obtain indemnification from foreign vendors may be hindered by our ability to obtain jurisdiction over them to enforce contractual obligations even with adequate insurance and indemnification such claims could significantly harm our reputation and consumer confidence in our products and we could incur significant litigation expenses which also could materially affect our results of operations even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or not fully pursued

our current insurance program may expose us to unexpected costs and negatively affect our financial performance 

our insurance coverage reflects deductibles selfinsured retentions limits of liability and similar provisions that we believe are prudent based on our operations however there are types of losses we may incur but against which we cannot be insured or which we believe are not economically reasonable to insure such as losses due to acts of war certain crimes including employee crime certain wage and hour and other employmentrelated claims and litigation actions based on certain consumer protection laws and some natural and other disasters or similar events if we incur material uninsured losses our financial performance could suffer certain material events have resulted and may result again in the future in sizable losses for the insurance industry and adversely affect the availability of adequate insurance coverage or result in excessive premium increases to offset negative insurance market trends we may elect to selfinsure accept higher deductibles or reduce the amount of coverage in addition we selfinsure a significant portion of expected losses under our workers’ compensation automobile liability general liability including claims made against certain of our landlords property loss and group health insurance programs significant changes in actuarial assumptions and management estimates underlying our recorded liabilities for these losses including any expected increases in medical and indemnity costs could result in materially different expenses than expected under these programs which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition although we maintain property insurance for catastrophic events at our store support center and distribution centers we are effectively selfinsured for other property losses if we experience a greater number of these losses than we anticipate our financial performance could be adversely affected

failure to attract develop and retain qualified employees while controlling labor costs as well as other labor issues could adversely affect our financial performance 

our future growth and performance positive customer experience and legal and regulatory compliance depends on our ability to attract develop retain and motivate qualified employees while operating in an industry challenged by historically high rates of employee turnover our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling our labor costs is subject to many external factors including competition for and availability of qualified personnel unemployment levels wage rates including the heightened possibility of increased federal state andor local minimum wage rates health and other insurance costs changes in employment and labor laws or other workplace regulations including those relating to employee benefit programs such as health insurance and paid leave programs employee activism and our reputation and relevance within the labor market if we are unable to attract 

develop and retain adequate numbers of qualified employees our operations customer service levels legal and regulatory compliance and support functions could suffer in addition to the extent a significant portion of our employee base unionizes or attempts to unionize our labor and other related costs could increase our ability to pass along labor and other related costs to our customers is constrained by our everyday low price model and we may not be able to offset such increased costs elsewhere in our business

our success depends on our executive officers and other key personnel if we lose key personnel or are unable to hire additional qualified personnel our business may be harmed 

our future success depends to a significant degree on the skills experience and efforts of our executive officers and other key personnel the unexpected loss of the services of any of such persons could adversely affect our operations there can be no assurance that our executive succession planning retention or hiring efforts will be successful competition for skilled and experienced management personnel is intense and a failure to attract and retain new qualified personnel could adversely affect our operations 

our private brands may not be successful in improving our gross profit rate and may increase certain of the risks we face 

the sale of private brand items is an important component of our sales growth and gross profit rate enhancement plans broad market acceptance of our private brands depends on many factors including pricing quality customer perception and timely development and introduction of new products we cannot give assurance that we will achieve or maintain our expected level of private brand sales the sale and expansion of these offerings also subjects us to or increases certain risks such as product liability claims and product recalls disruptions in raw material and finished product supply and distribution chains inability to successfully protect our proprietary rights claims related to the proprietary rights of third parties supplier labor and human rights issues and other risks generally encountered by entities that source sell and market exclusive branded offerings for retail failure to appropriately address these risks could materially and adversely affect our private brand initiatives reputation results of operations and financial condition

because our business is somewhat seasonal adverse events during the fourth quarter could materially affect our financial statements as a whole 

primarily because of sales of christmasrelated merchandise our most profitable sales mix generally occurs in the fourth quarter in anticipation of this holiday we purchase substantial amounts of seasonal inventory and if sales fall below seasonal norms or our expectations it could result in unanticipated markdowns adverse events such as deteriorating economic conditions high unemployment rates high gas prices transportation disruptions or unusual or unanticipated adverse weather could result in lowerthanplanned sales during the christmas selling season which in turn could reduce our profitability and otherwise adversely affect our financial performance and operating results

regulatory legal compliance and accounting risks 

a significant change in governmental regulations and requirements could materially increase our cost of doing business and noncompliance with governmental regulations could materially and adversely affect our financial performance 

we routinely incur significant costs in complying with numerous and frequently changing laws and regulations the complexity of this regulatory environment and related compliance costs continue to increase due to additional legal and regulatory requirements our expanding operations and increased regulatory scrutiny and enforcement efforts new or revised laws regulations policies and related interpretations and enforcement practices particularly those dealing with the sale of products including without limitation product and food safety marketing or labeling information security and privacy labor and employment employee wages and benefits health and safety imports and customs taxes and environmental compliance may significantly increase our expenses or require extensive system and operating changes that could materially increase our cost of doing business violations of applicable laws and regulations or untimely or incomplete execution of a required product recall can result in 

significant penalties including loss of licenses eligibility to accept certain government benefits such as snap or significant fines class action or other litigation governmental investigation or action and reputational damage additionally changes in tax laws including those related to the corporate tax rate the interpretation of existing laws or our failure to sustain our reporting positions on examination could adversely affect our overall effective tax rate furthermore significant andor rapid increases to federal state andor local minimum wage rates could adversely affect our earnings if we are not able to otherwise offset these increased labor costs elsewhere in our business 

legal proceedings may adversely affect our reputation business results of operations and financial condition 

our business is subject to the risk of litigation or other legal proceedings by employees consumers suppliers competitors shareholders government agencies and others through private actions class actions multidistrict litigation arbitrations derivative actions administrative proceedings regulatory actions or other litigation for example we are involved in certain legal proceedings as discussed in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements the outcome of legal proceedings particularly class action or multidistrict litigation or mass arbitrations and regulatory actions can be difficult to assess or quantify plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts and the magnitude of the potential loss may remain unknown for lengthy periods in addition certain of these matters if decided adversely to us or settled by us may result in liability material to our financial statements as a whole or may negatively affect our operating results if changes to our business operations are required and sometimes these developments are unanticipated legal proceedings in general and class actions multidistrict litigation governmental investigations and actions and derivative actions in particular can be expensive and disruptive and adverse publicity could harm our reputation regardless of the validity of the allegations as a result legal proceedings may adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition see also note 7 to the consolidated financial statements

new accounting guidance or changes in the interpretation or application of existing accounting guidance could adversely affect our financial performance 

the implementation of new accounting standards could require certain systems internal process and controls and other changes that could increase our operating costs and result in changes to our financial statements in 2019 for example the implementation of accounting standards related to leases as issued by the financial accounting standards board required us to make significant changes to our lease management and other accounting systems and resulted in a material impact to our consolidated financial statements 

us generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by our management changes in these rules or their interpretation or in underlying management assumptions estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance the outcome of such changes could include litigation or regulatory actions which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

financial and capital market risks 

deterioration in market conditions or changes in our credit profile could adversely affect our business operations and financial condition 

we rely on the positive cash flow we generate from our operating activities and our access to the credit and capital markets to fund our operations growth strategy and return of cash to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends changes in the credit and capital markets including market disruptions limited liquidity and interest rate fluctuations may increase the cost of financing or restrict our access to these potential sources of future liquidity our continued access to liquidity sources on favorable terms depends on multiple factors including our operating performance and credit ratings our debt securities currently are rated investment grade and a downgrade of this rating likely would negatively impact our access to the debt capital markets and increase our cost of borrowing as a result disruptions in the debt markets or any downgrade of our credit ratings could adversely 

affect our business operations and financial condition and our ability to return cash to our shareholders we can make no assurances that our ability to obtain additional financing through the debt markets will not be adversely affected by economic conditions or that we will be able to maintain or improve our current credit ratings

​ 

impact of covid19 

​ 

the covid19 coronavirus pandemic has resulted in widespread and continuing impacts on the global economy and has affected our business as well as our customers suppliers and other business partners we have been classified as an essential business in all locations where we operate and as such our stores have generally remained open to serve our customers in responding to the pandemic and its effects our priority has been the health and safety of our employees and customers in order to serve our employees and customers during this time while prioritizing their wellbeing we have taken a variety of actions across our stores distribution centers and store support center including as applicable enhancing cleaning protocols designating one hour each day for our elderly customers to shop our stores with limited crowds implementing social distancing measures providing personal protective equipment eg gloves masks and hand sanitizer for employees providing employee temperature checks at our distribution facilities installing plexiglass barriers at registers providing paid time off for those who received a covid19 diagnosis or who were required to care for an immediate family or household member who received a covid19 diagnosis and providing a onetime payment for hourly frontline employees who receive a complete covid19 vaccination

​ 

in early march 2020 we began seeing heightened demand from customers particularly for consumable products such as paper food and cleaning products which continued throughout 2020 although with some variability as to the volume and product mix beginning in april we also saw a significant increase in demand in many nonconsumable products including home seasonal and apparel resulting in an overall significant mix shift into nonconsumable categories in the remainder of 2020 also beginning in early march 2020 many new customers began shopping with us for their everyday essential needs and we are working to retain them going forward we have also seen a shift in customer behavior toward trip consolidation as customers shopped our stores less frequently than in the same period in 2019 but purchased a larger average basket amount we have seen a continuation of these general trends toward trip consolidation and larger basket size to address the increased demand we increased our hiring of new store associates in march and april of 2020 and have worked and continue to work with suppliers to incorporate new items in stores to meet the essential needs of customers while addressing certain product shortages and vendor allocation limitations some of which we expect to persist through at least the first half of 2021 we believe that this increased customer demand significantly benefited our results of operations and in particular sales gross profit operating income and net income for fiscal 2020 although we incurred additional payroll related expenses throughout fiscal 2020 including employee appreciation bonuses of approximately 167 million increased distribution and transportation costs and other costs to meet the significant customer demand and to protect the health and safety of our employees and customers these costs were more than offset by the incremental sales the overall net impact of the pandemic to operating income and net income in 2021 may be less favorable due to the moderating positive impact to our net sales and our anticipation that some of these incremental costs particularly those related to health and safety measures will continue into 2021 

​ 

we expect to continue to be affected although the extent and duration is unknown by the covid19 pandemic and its effects on the economy in a variety of ways potentially including changing consumer demand whether higher or lower in certain product categories supply chain interruptions increased distribution and transportation costs increased payroll expenses and increased costs in an effort to maintain safe work and shopping environments additionally the vast shutdown of andor significant operating limitations imposed upon many businesses in the united states has resulted in high levels of unemployment which along with current and potential school closures and operating limitations could have a significant adverse impact on our core customers for an unknown length of time the potential for additional economic stabilization efforts including additional government stimulus payments and enhanced unemployment benefits and other government assistance and the effects thereof are uncertain in addition to the items described above we expect the current adverse global economic conditions 

caused by the covid19 pandemic to continue in at least the near term potentially resulting in continued elevated unemployment reduced economic activity and capital markets volatility we may experience adverse effects on our business results of operations and cash flows from a recessionary economic environment that may persist after the covid19 pandemic has moderated as a result the quarterly cadence of our results of operations which varied from historical patterns in fiscal 2020 may continue to do so in fiscal 2021 

​ 

due to the significant uncertainty surrounding the covid19 pandemic and its effects there may be consequences that we do not anticipate at this time or that develop in unexpected ways we will continue to monitor the evolving situation and we will continue to take actions as necessary to serve our employees customers communities and shareholders

​ 

executive overview 

​ 

we are the largest discount retailer in the united states by number of stores with 17266 stores located in 46 states as of february 26 2021 with the greatest concentration of stores in the southern southwestern midwestern and eastern united states we offer a broad selection of merchandise including consumable products such as food paper and cleaning products health and beauty products and pet supplies and nonconsumable products such as seasonal merchandise home decor and domestics and basic apparel our merchandise includes national brands from leading manufacturers as well as our own private brand selections with prices at substantial discounts to national brands we offer our customers these national brand and private brand products at everyday low prices typically 10 or less in our convenient smallbox locations

​ 

we believe our convenient store formats locations and broad selection of highquality products at compelling values have driven our substantial growth and financial success over the years and through a variety of economic cycles we are mindful that the majority of our customers are valueconscious and many have low andor fixed incomes as a result we are intensely focused on helping our customers make the most of their spending dollars our core customers are often among the first to be affected by negative or uncertain economic conditions and among the last to feel the effects of improving economic conditions particularly when trends are inconsistent and of an uncertain duration the primary macroeconomic factors that affect our core customers include the unemployment and underemployment rates wage growth changes in us and global trade policy including price increases resulting from the imposition of tariffs and changes to certain government assistance programs such as the supplemental nutrition assistance program in 2020 our customers experienced impacts to many of these factors as detailed above under “impact of covid19” additionally our customers are impacted by increases in those expenses that generally comprise a large portion of their household budgets such as rent healthcare and fuel prices finally significant unseasonable or unusual weather patterns can impact customer shopping behaviors 

​ 

we remain committed to our longterm operating priorities as we consistently strive to improve our performance while retaining our customercentric focus these priorities include 1 driving profitable sales growth 2 capturing growth opportunities 3 enhancing our position as a lowcost operator and 4 investing in our diverse teams through development empowerment and inclusion 

​ 

we seek to drive profitable sales growth through initiatives aimed at increasing customer traffic and average transaction amount as we work to provide everyday low prices and meet our customers’ affordability needs we remain focused on enhancing our margins through effective category management inventory shrink reduction initiatives private brands penetration distribution and transportation efficiencies global sourcing and pricing and markdown optimization several of our strategic and other salesdriving initiatives are also designed to capture growth opportunities and are discussed in more detail below

​ 

historically our sales in our consumables category which tend to have lower gross margins have been the key drivers of net sales and customer traffic while sales in our nonconsumables categories which tend to have higher gross margins have contributed to more profitable sales growth and an increase in average transaction amount prior to 2020 our sales mix had continued to shift toward consumables and within consumables toward lower margin departments such as perishables although this trend did not occur in 2020 as discussed above under “impact of covid19” we continue to expect some sales mix challenges to persist and we expect the trend toward consumables will resume in 2021 and beyond several of our initiatives including certain of those discussed 

below are intended to address these mix challenges however there can be no assurances that these efforts will be successful

​ 

we continue to make progress on and invest in certain strategic initiatives that we believe will help drive profitable sales growth both with new and existing customers and capture longterm growth opportunities such opportunities include leveraging existing and developing new digital tools and technology to provide our customers with additional shopping access points and even greater convenience this technology includes our dollar general app which contains a variety of tools to enhance the instore shopping experience additionally dg pickup which is a buy online pickup instore initiative aimed at offering another convenient access point for customers is now available in more than 17000 stores across the chain

​ 

our nonconsumables initiative or “nci” offers a new differentiated and limited assortment that will change throughout the year nci is continuing to evolve and help shape our approach to nonconsumables categories throughout the chain and is contributing to improved overall sales and gross margin performance in the stores where it is offered as we extend this initiative more broadly as well as incorporate certain related merchandising efforts throughout our chain our goal is to provide our customers with a broader even more relevant nonconsumables merchandise assortment while continuing to deliver exceptional value within key areas of our nonconsumables categories additionally as we expand this offering we plan to incorporate the full nci set in certain stores as well as an “nci lite” version in others so as to reach a greater number of stores and customers more quickly the nci lite version incorporates the majority of the nci assortment but without the footprint and display changes in the store we plan to significantly expand the number of stores with either the full nci or nci lite version in 2021 with a goal of more than 11000 stores by the end of fiscal 2021 

​ 

additionally we recently introduced popshelf a unique retail concept that incorporates certain of the lessons learned from nci in a differentiated format that is focused on categories such as seasonal and home décor health and beauty home cleaning supplies and party and entertainment goods our goal is to operate up to 50 popshelf locations by the end of fiscal 2021 

​ 

we are continuing our rollout of the “dg fresh” initiative a selfdistribution model for frozen and refrigerated products that is designed to reduce product costs enhance item assortment improve our instock position and enhance sales by the end of fiscal 2021 we plan to complete our initial rollout of dg fresh distribution facilities which will serve all stores across the chain dg fresh contributed to our strong sales performance in 2020 driven by higher instock levels and the introduction of new products in select stores in addition dg fresh benefitted gross profit in 2020 through improved initial markups on inventory purchases which were partially offset by increased distribution and transportation costs we expect this net benefit to continue in 2021 as we proceed with the rollout 

​ 

tariffs on products from china as applied to both our direct imports and domestic purchases did not have a net material impact on our financial results in 2020 and we do not expect a net material impact in 2021 as noted above changes in trade policy that result in higher prices for our customers may negatively impact their budgets and consequently their spending and additional increases in tariff rates or expansion of products subject to tariffs may have a more significant impact on our future business 

​ 

to support our other operating priorities we remain focused on capturing growth opportunities in 2020 we opened 1000 new stores remodeled 1670 stores and relocated 110 stores the covid19 pandemic has not materially delayed our real estate plans and based on information currently known to management we do not expect any significant delays in 2021 for 2021 we plan to open approximately 1050 new stores including any popshelf stores remodel approximately 1750 stores and relocate approximately 100 stores for a total of 2900 real estate projects

​ 

we continue to innovate within our channel and are able to utilize the most productive of our various dollar general store formats based on the specific market opportunity we expect that our traditional 7300 square foot store format will continue to be the primary store layout for new stores in 2021 we expect approximately 75 of our planned remodels in 2021 to feature our highercoolercount store format that enables us to offer an increased selection of perishable items in addition the majority of these and other real estate projects in 2021 will also 

incorporate highcapacity coolers our smaller format store less than 6000 square feet is expected to allow us to capture growth opportunities in urban areas we have also recently introduced two new larger format stores one at approximately 8500 square feet and the other at approximately 9500 square feet which allows us to further expand our offering and our ability to serve our customers beginning later in 2021 we expect the 8500 squarefoot concept along with our existing dollar general plus format of a similar size to become our base prototypes for nearly all new stores moving forward replacing our traditional 7300 square foot store format and highercooler count dollar general traditional plus format the innovation in store formats is expected to allow us to capture additional growth opportunities within our existing markets we continue to incorporate lessons learned from our various store formats and layouts into our existing store base these lessons contribute to innovation in developing new formats with a goal of driving increased customer traffic average transaction amount samestore sales and overall store productivity

​ 

we have established a position as a lowcost operator always seeking ways to reduce or control costs that do not affect our customers’ shopping experiences we plan to continue enhancing this position over time while employing ongoing cost discipline to reduce certain expenses as a percentage of sales nonetheless we seek to maintain flexibility to invest in the business as necessary to enhance our longterm competitiveness and profitability we have experienced incremental costs related to the covid19 pandemic as discussed above under “impact of covid19” and below under “results of operations” some of which are expected to continue in 2021

​ 

we also have launched “fast track” an initiative aimed at further enhancing our convenience proposition and instock position as well as increasing labor efficiencies within our stores the first phase of fast track involved sorting process optimization within our distribution centers as well as increased shelfready packaging to allow for greater storelevel stocking efficiencies followed by the secondphase pilot of a selfcheckout option in a limited number of stores we completed the sorting process optimization at all of our nonrefrigerated distribution centers in 2019 additionally we expect to continue to add selfcheckout capabilities in additional stores throughout 2021 these and the other strategic initiatives discussed above will require us to incur upfront expenses for which there may not be an immediate return in terms of sales or enhanced profitability 

​ 

certain of our operating expenses such as wage rates and occupancy costs have continued to increase in recent years due primarily to market forces including increases in minimum wage rates while we expect these increases to persist certain of our initiatives and plans are intended to help offset these challenges although there can be no assurance we will be successful in mitigating them in addition federal state andor local minimum wage increases could have a material negative impact on our operating expenses although the magnitude and timing of such impact and our ability to mitigate whether in whole or in part depends on the scale and timing of the mandated increases among other factors we have also experienced incremental payroll distribution and transportation costs related to the covid19 pandemic as discussed above under “impact of covid19” 

​ 

our diverse teams are a competitive advantage and we proactively seek ways to continue investing in their development our goal is to create an environment that attracts develops and retains talented personnel particularly at the store manager level because employees who are promoted from within our company generally have longer tenures and are greater contributors to improvements in our financial performance we believe our investments in compensation and training for our store managers have contributed to improved customer experience scores higher sales and improved turnover metrics 

​ 

to further enhance shareholder returns we repurchased shares of our common stock and paid quarterly cash dividends throughout 2020 in 2021 we expect to continue our share repurchase activity and to pay quarterly cash dividends subject to board discretion and approval

​ 

we utilize key performance indicators “kpis” in the management of our business our kpis include samestore sales average sales per square foot and inventory turnover samestore sales are calculated based upon stores that were open at least 13 full fiscal months and remain open at the end of the reporting period we include stores that have been remodeled expanded or relocated in our samestore sales calculation changes in samestore sales are calculated based on the comparable 52 calendar weeks in the current and prior years net sales per square foot is calculated based on total sales for the preceding 12 months as of the ending date of the reporting period divided by the average selling square footage during the period including the end of the fiscal year the beginning of 

the fiscal year and the end of each of our three interim fiscal quarters inventory turnover is calculated based on total cost of goods sold for the preceding four quarters divided by the average inventory balance as of the ending date of the reporting period including the end of the fiscal year the beginning of the fiscal year and the end of each of our three interim fiscal quarters each of these measures is commonly used by investors in retail companies to measure the health of the business we use these measures to maximize profitability and for decisions about the allocation of resources

​ 

a continued focus on our four operating priorities as discussed above coupled with pandemicrelated sales and other impacts additional discussion below and strong cash flow management resulted in strong overall operating and financial performance in 2020 as compared to 2019 as set forth below basis points as referred to below are equal to 001 as a percentage of net sales

results of operations 

​ 

accounting periods the following text contains references to years 2020 2019 and 2018 which represent fiscal years ended january 29 2021 january 31 2020 and february 1 2019 respectively our fiscal year ends on the friday closest to january 31 fiscal years 2020 2019 and 2018 were each 52week accounting periods

​ 

seasonality  the nature of our business is somewhat seasonal primarily because of sales of christmasrelated merchandise operating profit in our fourth quarter november december and january has historically been higher than operating profit achieved in each of the first three quarters of the fiscal year expenses and to a greater extent operating profit vary by quarter results of a period shorter than a full year may not be indicative of results expected for the entire year furthermore the seasonal nature of our business may affect comparisons between 

periods consumer behavior driven by the covid19 pandemic has resulted in a departure from seasonal norms we have experienced in recent years and may continue to disrupt the historical quarterly cadence of our results of operations for an unknown period of time

​ 

the following table contains results of operations data for fiscal years 2020 2019 and 2018 and the dollar and percentage variances among those years

​ 

 ​ 

net sales  the net sales increase in 2020 reflects a samestore sales increase of 163 compared to 2019 in 2020 our 16050 samestores accounted for sales of 319 billion the increase in samestore sales reflects an increase in average transaction amount driven by a significant increase in items per transaction and to a lesser degree higher average item retail prices which were offset in part by a decline in customer traffic samestore sales increased in each of the consumables seasonal home products and apparel categories with the largest percentage increase in the home products category the 2020 net sales increase was positively affected by new stores modestly offset by sales from closed stores

​ 

the net sales increase in 2019 reflects a samestore sales increase of 39 compared to 2018 in 2019 our 15209 samestores accounted for sales of 264 billion the increase in samestore sales primarily reflects an increase in average transaction amount and customer traffic compared to 2018 the increase in average transaction amount was driven by higher average item retail prices samestore sales in 2019 increased in each of the consumables seasonal and home products and apparel categories compared to 2018 the 2019 net sales increase was positively affected by new stores modestly offset by sales from closed stores

​ 

gross profit in 2020 gross profit increased by 263 and as a percentage of net sales increased by 117 basis points to 318 compared to 2019 a reduction in markdowns as a percentage of net sales and higher initial 

markups on inventory purchases each contributed to the increase in the gross profit rate in addition nonconsumables sales increased at a higher rate than consumables sales in 2020 which contributed to the increase in the gross profit rate we also experienced a lower rate of inventory shrink in 2020 compared to 2019 i t is uncertain at this time whether these trends which differ from our recent historical trends prior to 2020 will continue these factors were partially offset by increased distribution and transportation costs which were impacted by increased volume some of which is attributable to the covid19 pandemic and discretionary employee bonus expense as noted above we believe the effect of the covid19 pandemic on consumer behavior had a significant positive effect on net sales and also had a positive effect on our gross profit 

​ 

in 2019 gross profit increased by 88 and as a percentage of net sales increased by 14 basis points to 306 compared to 2018 higher initial markups on inventory purchases and a lower lifo provision contributed to the increase in the gross profit rate these factors were partially offset by increased distribution and transportation costs a greater proportion of sales of consumables which generally have a lower gross profit rate than our other product categories and sales of lower margin products comprising a higher proportion of consumables sales as well as a higher rate of inventory shrinkage

sga sga as a percentage of net sales was 212 in 2020 compared to 223 in 2019 a decrease of 106 basis points although we incurred certain incremental costs discussed above under “impact of covid19” including discretionary employee bonus expense they were more than offset by the significant increase in net sales during the period as discussed above among the expenses that were a lower percentage of net sales in 2020 were retail labor store occupancy costs utilities and depreciation and amortization in addition we recorded expenses of 310 million in 2019 reflecting our estimate for the settlement of significant legal matters these items were partially offset by 2020 increases in incentive compensation and hurricanerelated expenses 

​ 

sga as a percentage of sales was 223 in 2019 compared to 222 in 2018 an increase of 9 basis points which included the 310 million estimate in 2019 for the settlement of significant legal matters sga in 2019 included a decrease of approximately 228 million in hurricane and other disasterrelated expenses compared to 2018 as well as an increase in retail labor costs at a rate less than the increase in net sales 

​ 

interest expense  interest expense increased 498 million to 1504 million in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to higher average outstanding debt balances in connection with the issuance of debt in the first quarter of 2020 and increased 07 million to 1006 million in 2019 compared to 2018 see the detailed discussion under “liquidity and capital resources” regarding the financing of various longterm obligations

​ 

we had consolidated outstanding variablerate debt of 34 million and 4301 million as of january 29 2021 and january 31 2020 respectively and the remainder of our outstanding indebtedness as of each of those dates was fixed rate debt 

​ 

other income expense  other income expense in 2018 reflects expenses associated with the voluntary prepayment of our senior unsecured term loan facility

​ 

income taxes  the effective income tax rate for 2020 was 220 compared to a rate of 222 for 2019 which represents a net decrease of 02 percentage points the effective income tax rate was lower in 2020 primarily due to increased tax benefits associated with sharebased compensation and a larger income tax rate benefit from state taxes offset by a lower income tax rate benefit from federal income tax credits due primarily to higher pretax earnings in 2020 compared to 2019 

​ 

the effective income tax rate for 2019 was 222 compared to a rate of 211 for 2018 which represents a net increase of 11 percentage points the effective income tax rate was higher in 2019 primarily due to an increase in income taxes resulting from changes in state income tax laws and a federal income tax benefit arising from the tax cuts and jobs act in 2018 that did not reoccur in 2019

​ 

off balance sheet arrangements 

​ 

we are not party to any material off balance sheet arrangements

​ 

effects of inflation 

​ 

in 2020 2019 and 2018 we experienced increases in product costs due in part to tariffs on certain items imported from china 

​ 

liquidity and capital resources 

​ 

current financial condition and recent developments 

​ 

during the past three years we have generated an aggregate of approximately 83 billion in cash flows from operating activities and incurred approximately 25 billion in capital expenditures during that period we expanded the number of stores we operate by 2643 representing growth of approximately 18 and we remodeled or relocated 4069 stores or approximately 28 of the stores we operated as of the beginning of the threeyear period in 2021 we intend to continue our current strategy of pursuing store growth remodels and relocations

​ 

at january 29 2021 we had a 125 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement the “revolving facility” 40 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes and a commercial paper program that may provide borrowing availability of up to 10 billion at january 29 2021 we had total consolidated outstanding debt including the current portion of longterm obligations of 41 billion most of which was in the form of senior notes all of our material borrowing arrangements are described in greater detail below our borrowing availability under the revolving facility may be effectively limited by our commercial paper notes “cp notes” as further described below the information contained in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii item 8 of this report is incorporated herein by reference 

​ 

at january 29 2021 we had a total consolidated cash balance of 14 billion our balance of cash and cash equivalents was impacted by our issuance of senior unsecured notes in april 2020 as we sought to strengthen liquidity as a result of uncertainty created by the covid19 pandemic

​ 

we believe our cash flow from operations and our existing cash balances combined with availability under the revolving facility cp notes and access to the debt markets will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our current obligations projected working capital requirements capital spending and anticipated dividend payments for a period that includes the next twelve months as well as the next several years however our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity may be affected by numerous factors many of which are outside of our control depending on our liquidity levels conditions in the capital markets and other factors we may from time to time consider the issuance of debt equity or other securities the proceeds of which could provide additional liquidity for our operations 

​ 

for fiscal 2021 we anticipate potential combined borrowings under the revolving facility and cp notes to be a maximum of approximately 600 million outstanding at any one time including any anticipated borrowings to fund repurchases of common stock

​ 

revolving credit facility 

​ 

on september 10 2019 we entered into the revolving facility consisting of a 125 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility of which up to 1750 million is available for the issuance of letters of credit and which is scheduled to mature on september 10 2024 

​ 

borrowings under the revolving facility bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable interest rate margin plus at our option either a libor or b a base rate which is usually equal to the prime rate the applicable interest rate margin for borrowings as of january 29 2021 was 1015 for libor borrowings and 0015 for baserate borrowings we must also pay a facility fee payable on any used and unused commitment amounts of the revolving facility and customary fees on letters of credit issued under the revolving facility as of january 29 2021 the facility fee rate was 011 the applicable interest rate margins for borrowings the facility fees and the 

letter of credit fees under the revolving facility are subject to adjustment from time to time based on our longterm senior unsecured debt ratings 

​ 

the revolving facility contains a number of customary affirmative and negative covenants that among other things restrict subject to certain exceptions our including our subsidiaries’ ability to incur additional liens sell all or substantially all of our assets consummate certain fundamental changes or change in our lines of business and incur additional subsidiary indebtedness the revolving facility also contains financial covenants that require the maintenance of a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio as of january 29 2021 we were in compliance with all such covenants the revolving facility also contains customary events of default 

​ 

as of january 29 2021 under the revolving facility we had no outstanding borrowings outstanding letters of credit of 35 million and borrowing availability of 125 billion that due to our intention to maintain borrowing availability related to the commercial paper program described below could contribute incremental liquidity of 107 billion at january 29 2021 in addition as of january 29 2021 we had outstanding letters of credit of 777 million which were issued pursuant to separate agreements

​ 

commercial paper 

​ 

as of january 29 2021 our consolidated balance sheet reflected no outstanding unsecured cp notes cp notes totaling 1810 million were held by a whollyowned subsidiary and therefore are not reflected on the consolidated balance sheet we may issue the cp notes from time to time in an aggregate amount not to exceed 10 billion outstanding at any time the cp notes may have maturities of up to 364 days from the date of issue and rank equal in right of payment with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness we intend to maintain available commitments under the revolving facility in an amount at least equal to the amount of cp notes outstanding at any time 

​ 

senior notes 

​ 

in april 2013 we issued 9000 million aggregate principal amount of 325 senior notes due 2023 the “2023 senior notes” at a discount of 24 million which are scheduled to mature on april 15 2023 in october 2015 we issued 5000 million aggregate principal amount of 4150 senior notes due 2025 the “2025 senior notes” at a discount of 08 million which are scheduled to mature on november 1 2025 in april 2017 we issued 6000 million aggregate principal amount of 3875 senior notes due 2027 the “2027 senior notes” at a discount of 04 million which are scheduled to mature on april 15 2027 in april 2018 we issued 5000 million aggregate principal amount of 4125 senior notes due 2028 the “2028 senior notes” at a discount of 05 million which are scheduled to mature on may 1 2028 in april 2020 we issued 10 billion aggregate principal amount of 35 senior notes due 2030 the “2030 senior notes” at a discount of 07 million which are scheduled to mature on april 3 2030 and 5000 million aggregate principal amount of 4125 senior notes due 2050 the “2050 senior notes” at a discount of 50 million which are scheduled to mature on april 3 2050 collectively the 2023 senior notes 2025 senior notes 2027 senior notes 2028 senior notes 2030 senior notes and 2050 senior notes comprise the “senior notes” each of which were issued pursuant to an indenture as supplemented and amended by supplemental indentures relating to each series of senior notes as so supplemented and amended the “senior indenture” interest on the 2023 senior notes and the 2027 senior notes is payable in cash on april 15 and october 15 of each year interest on the 2025 and 2028 senior notes is payable in cash on may 1 and november 1 of each year interest on the 2030 and 2050 senior notes is payable in cash on april 3 and october 3 of each year 

​ 

we may redeem some or all of the senior notes at any time at redemption prices set forth in the senior indenture upon the occurrence of a change of control triggering event which is defined in the senior indenture each holder of our senior notes has the right to require us to repurchase some or all of such holder’s senior notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101 of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest if any to but excluding the repurchase date

​ 

the senior indenture contains covenants limiting among other things our ability subject to certain exceptions to consolidate merge or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets and our ability 

and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur or guarantee indebtedness secured by liens on any shares of voting stock of significant subsidiaries

​ 

the senior indenture also provides for events of default which if any of them occurs would permit or require the principal of and accrued interest on our senior notes to become or to be declared due and payable as applicable

​ 

rating agencies 

​ 

our senior unsecured debt is rated “baa2” by moody’s with a stable outlook and “bbb” by standard  poor’s with a stable outlook and our commercial paper program is rated “p2” by moody’s and “a2” by standard and poor’s our current credit ratings as well as future rating agency actions could i impact our ability to finance our operations on satisfactory terms ii affect our financing costs and iii affect our insurance premiums and collateral requirements necessary for our selfinsured programs there can be no assurance that we will maintain or improve our current credit ratings

​ 

contractual obligations

 ​ 

share repurchase program 

​ 

our common stock repurchase program had a total remaining authorization of approximately 068 billion at january 29 2021 effective march 17 2021 our board of directors authorized a 2 billion increase to such program which resulted in a total remaining authorization of approximately 238 billion under the program at such date the authorization allows repurchases from time to time in open market transactions including pursuant to trading plans adopted in accordance with rule 10b51 of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended or in privately negotiated transactions the timing manner and number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including price market conditions compliance with the covenants and restrictions under our debt agreements and other factors the repurchase program has no expiration date and may be modified or terminated from time to time at the discretion of our board of directors for more detail about our share repurchase program see part ii item 5 of this report and note 11 to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii item 8 of this report

​ 

other considerations 

​ 

on march 16 2021 the board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 042 per share which is payable on or before april 20 2021 to shareholders of record of our common stock on april 6 2021 we paid quarterly cash dividends of 036 per share in 2020 although the board currently expects to continue regular quarterly cash dividends the declaration and amount of future cash dividends are subject to the board’s sole discretion and will depend upon among other factors our results of operations cash requirements financial condition contractual restrictions and other factors that our board may deem relevant in its sole discretion

​ 

our inventory balance represented approximately 48 of our total assets exclusive of goodwill operating lease assets and other intangible assets as of january 29 2021 our ability to effectively manage our inventory balances can have a significant impact on our cash flows from operations during a given fiscal year inventory purchases are often somewhat seasonal in nature such as the purchase of warmweather or christmasrelated merchandise efficient management of our inventory has been and continues to be an area of focus for us

​ 

as described in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements we are involved in a number of legal actions and claims some of which could potentially result in material cash payments adverse developments in those actions could materially and adversely affect our liquidity 

​ 

cash flows 

​ 

cash flows from operating activities cash flows from operating activities were 388 billion in 2020 which represents a 164 billion increase compared to 2019 as noted above the covid19 pandemic has resulted in increased sales gross profit and operating income which contributed to the increase in net income of 9425 million in 2020 over 2019 changes in accounts payable resulted in a 7456 million increase in our working capital in 2020 compared to a 4286 million increase in 2019 due primarily to the timing of receipts and payments changes in accrued expenses resulted in a 3886 million increase in our working capital in 2020 compared to a 1003 million increase in 2019 due primarily to increased accruals for compensation and nonincome taxes changes in merchandise inventories resulted in a 5758 million decrease in our working capital in 2020 which was similar to the decrease of 5788 million in 2019 as described in greater detail below changes in income taxes including an increase in cash paid for income taxes in 2020 compared to 2019 are primarily due to the increase in pretax earnings in 2020

​ 

cash flows from operating activities were 224 billion in 2019 which represents a 944 million increase compared to 2018 changes in accounts payable resulted in a 4286 million increase in 2019 compared to a 3752 million increase in 2018 due primarily to the timing of receipts and payments which was partially impacted by certain changes in payment terms in addition net income increased by 1231 million in 2019 over 2018 these 

items were offset by changes in merchandise inventories which resulted in a 5788 million decrease in 2019 as compared to a decrease of 5213 million in 2018 changes in income taxes in 2019 compared to 2018 are primarily due to the timing of payments for income taxes

​ 

on an ongoing basis we closely monitor and manage our inventory balances and they may fluctuate from period to period based on new store openings the timing of purchases and other factors merchandise inventories increased by 12 in 2020 by 14 in 2019 and by 14 in 2018 inventory levels in the consumables category increased by 4556 million or 15 in 2020 by 3719 million or 14 in 2019 and by 3209 million or 14 in 2018 the seasonal category increased by 357 million or 4 in 2020 by 1273 million or 17 in 2019 and by 1084 million or 17 in 2018 the home products category increased by 663 million or 15 in 2020 by 828 million or 23 in 2019 and by 240 million or 7 in 2018 the apparel category increased by 129 million or 3 in 2020 decreased by 21 million or 1 in 2019 and increased by 347 million or 10 in 2018

​ 

cash flows from investing activities  significant components of property and equipment purchases in 2020 included the following approximate amounts 447 million for improvements upgrades remodels and relocations of existing stores 271 million for distribution and transportationrelated capital expenditures 250 million related to store facilities primarily for leasehold improvements fixtures and equipment in new stores and 50 million for information systems upgrades and technologyrelated projects the timing of new remodeled and relocated store openings along with other factors may affect the relationship between such openings and the related property and equipment purchases in any given period during 2020 we opened 1000 new stores and remodeled or relocated 1780 stores

​ 

significant components of property and equipment purchases in 2019 included the following approximate amounts 338 million for improvements upgrades remodels and relocations of existing stores 217 million for distribution and transportationrelated projects 149 million for new leased stores primarily for leasehold improvements fixtures and equipment and 59 million for information systems upgrades and technologyrelated projects during 2019 we opened 975 new stores and remodeled or relocated 1124 stores

​ 

significant components of property and equipment purchases in 2018 included the following approximate amounts 289 million for improvements upgrades remodels and relocations of existing stores 242 million for distribution and transportationrelated projects 138 million for new leased stores primarily for leasehold improvements fixtures and equipment and 47 million for information systems upgrades and technologyrelated projects during 2018 we opened 900 new stores and remodeled or relocated 1165 stores 

​ 

capital expenditures during 2021 are projected to be in the range of 105 billion to 115 billion we anticipate funding 2021 capital requirements with a combination of some or all of the following existing cash balances cash flows from operations availability under our revolving facility andor the issuance of additional senior notes and cp notes we plan to continue to invest in store growth and development of approximately 1050 new stores and approximately 1850 stores to be remodeled or relocated capital expenditures in 2021 are anticipated to support our store growth as well as our remodel and relocation initiatives including capital outlays for leasehold improvements fixtures and equipment the construction of new stores costs to support and enhance our supply chain initiatives including new and existing distribution center facilities and our private fleet technology initiatives as well as routine and ongoing capital requirements

​ 

cash flows from financing activities  in 2020 net proceeds from the issuance of the 2030 senior notes and 2050 senior notes totaled 15 billion net commercial paper borrowings decreased by 4252 million and borrowings and repayments under the revolving facility were 3000 million each we repurchased 123 million shares of our common stock at a total cost of 25 billion and paid cash dividends of 3559 million

​ 

in 2019 we had a net increase in consolidated commercial paper borrowings of 583 million and had no borrowings or repayments under the revolving facility we repurchased 83 million outstanding shares of our common stock in 2019 at a total cost of 12 billion and paid cash dividends of 3276 million

​

​ 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

​ 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “us gaap” requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures in addition to the estimates presented below there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed critical as defined below we believe these estimates are reasonable and appropriate however if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used the resulting changes could have a material effect on the financial statements taken as a whole

​ 

management believes the following policies and estimates are critical because they involve significant judgments assumptions and estimates management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosures presented below relating to those policies and estimates see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of our principal accounting policies

​ 

merchandise inventories  merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market “lcm” with cost determined using the retail last in first out “lifo” method we use the retail inventory method “rim” to calculate gross profit and the resulting valuation of inventories at cost which are computed utilizing a calculated costtoretail inventory ratio at an inventory department level we apply the rim to these departments which are groups of products that are fairly uniform in terms of cost selling price relationship and turnover the rim will result in valuing inventories at lcm if permanent markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories inherent in the rim calculation are certain management judgments and estimates that may impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the gross profit recognized these judgments include ensuring departments consist of similar products recording estimated shrinkage between physical inventories and timely recording of markdowns needed to sell inventory 

​ 

we perform an annual lifo analysis whereby all merchandise units are considered for inclusion in the index formulation an actual valuation of inventory under the lifo method is made at the end of each year based on the inventory levels and costs at that time in contrast interim lifo calculations are based on management’s annual estimates of sales the rate of inflation or deflation and yearend inventory levels we also perform analyses for determining obsolete inventory adjusting inventory on a quarterly basis to an lcm value based on various management assumptions including estimated below cost markdowns not yet recorded but required to liquidate such inventory in future periods

​ 

factors considered in the determination of markdowns include current and anticipated demand based on changes in competitors’ practices consumer preferences consumer spending significant weather events and unseasonable weather patterns certain of these factors are outside of our control and may result in greater than estimated markdowns to entice consumer purchases of excess inventory the amount and timing of markdowns may vary significantly from year to year

​ 

we perform physical inventories in virtually all of our stores on an annual basis due to the covid19 pandemic we were unable to perform physical inventories in our stores from midmarch through midmay in 2020 which prevented us from completing all of our planned store physical inventories in 2020 the effect of which was immaterial we calculate our shrink provision based on actual physical inventory results during the fiscal period and an accrual for estimated shrink occurring subsequent to a physical inventory through the end of the fiscal reporting period this accrual is calculated as a percentage of sales at each retail store at a department level based on the store’s most recent historical shrink rate to the extent that subsequent physical inventories yield different results than the estimated accrual our effective shrink rate for a given reporting period will include the impact of adjusting to the actual results 

​ 

we believe our estimates and assumptions related to the application of the rim results in a merchandise inventory valuation that reasonably approximates cost on a consistent basis 

​ 

impairment of longlived assets impairment of longlived assets results when the carrying value of the assets exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows generated by the assets our estimate of undiscounted future store cash flows is based upon historical operations of the stores and estimates of future profitability which encompasses many factors that are subject to variability and are difficult to predict if our estimates of future cash flows are not materially accurate our impairment analysis could be impacted accordingly if a longlived asset is found to be impaired the amount recognized for impairment is equal to the difference between the carrying value and the asset’s estimated fair value the fair value is estimated based primarily upon projected future cash flows discounted at our credit adjusted riskfree rate or other reasonable estimates of fair market value although not currently anticipated changes in these estimates assumptions or projections could materially affect the determination of fair value or impairment

​ 

insurance liabilities  we retain a significant portion of the risk for our workers’ compensation employee health general liability property loss automobile and certain thirdparty landlord claim exposures these represent significant costs primarily due to our large employee base and number of stores provisions are made for these liabilities on an undiscounted basis certain of these liabilities are based on actual claim data and estimates of incurred but not reported claims developed using actuarial methodologies based on historical claim trends which have been and are anticipated to continue to be materially accurate if future claim trends deviate from recent historical patterns or other unanticipated events affect the number and significance of future claims we may be required to record additional expenses or expense reductions which could be material to our future financial results

​ 

contingent liabilities – income taxes income tax reserves are determined using the methodology established by accounting standards relating to uncertainty in income taxes these standards require companies to assess each income tax position taken using a twostep process a determination is first made as to whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained based upon the technical merits upon examination by the taxing authorities if the tax position is expected to meet the more likely than not criteria the benefit recorded for the tax position equals the largest amount that is greater than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement of the respective tax position uncertain tax positions require determinations and liabilities to be estimated based on provisions of the tax law which may be subject to change or varying interpretation if our determinations and estimates prove to be inaccurate the resulting adjustments could be material to our future financial results

​ 

lease accounting  we adopted new accounting guidance related to leases as of february 2 2019 using the modified retrospective approach lease liabilities are recorded at a discount based upon our estimated collateralized incremental borrowing rate which involves significant judgments and estimates factors incorporated into the calculation of lease discount rates include the valuations and yields of our senior notes their credit spread over comparable us treasury rates and an index of the credit spreads for all north american investment grade companies by rating to determine an indicative secured rate we use the estimated credit spread improvement that would result from an upgrade of one ratings classification by tenor many of our stores are subject to buildtosuit arrangements with landlords which typically carry a primary lease term of up to 15 years with multiple renewal options we also have stores subject to shorterterm leases and many of these leases have renewal options we record single lease expense on a straightline basis over the lease term including any option periods that are reasonably certain to be renewed commencing on the date that we take physical possession of the property from the landlord tenant allowances to the extent received are recorded as a reduction of the right of use asset improvements of leased properties are amortized over the shorter of the life of the applicable lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset 

​ 

sharebased payments  our stock option awards are valued on an individual grant basis using the blackscholesmerton closed form option pricing model we believe that this model fairly estimates the value of our stock option awards the application of this valuation model involves assumptions that are judgmental in the valuation of stock options which affects compensation expense related to these options these assumptions include the term that the options are expected to be outstanding the historical volatility of our stock price applicable interest rates and the dividend yield of our stock other factors involving judgments that affect the expensing of sharebased payments include estimated forfeiture rates of sharebased awards historically these estimates have been materially accurate 

however if our estimates differ materially from actual experience we may be required to record additional expense or reductions of expense which could be material to our future financial results

​ 

fair value measurements accounting standards for the measurement of fair value of assets and liabilities establish a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity observable inputs that are classified within levels 1 and 2 of the hierarchy and the reporting entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions unobservable inputs classified within level 3 of the hierarchy therefore level 3 inputs are typically based on an entity’s own assumptions as there is little if any related market activity and thus require the use of significant judgment and estimates currently we have no assets or liabilities that are valued based solely on level 3 inputs our fair value measurements are primarily associated with our outstanding debt instruments we use various valuation models in determining the values of these liabilities we believe that in recent years these methodologies have produced materially accurate valuations

​ 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

​ 

financial risk management 

​ 

we are exposed to market risk primarily from adverse changes in interest rates and to a lesser degree commodity prices to minimize this risk we may periodically use financial instruments including derivatives all derivative financial instrument transactions must be authorized and executed pursuant to approval by the board of directors as a matter of policy we do not buy or sell financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes and any such derivative financial instruments are intended to be used to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure our objective is to correlate derivative financial instruments and the underlying exposure being hedged so that fluctuations in the value of the financial instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying economic exposure

​ 

interest rate risk 

​ 

we manage our interest rate risk through the strategic use of fixed and variable interest rate debt and from time to time derivative financial instruments in recent years our principal interest rate exposure has been from outstanding borrowings under our revolving facility as well as our commercial paper program as of january 29 2021 we had no consolidated borrowings under our commercial paper program and no borrowings outstanding under our revolving facility in order to mitigate a portion of the variable rate interest exposure under the credit facilities in prior years we have entered into various interest rate swaps as of january 29 2021 no such interest rate swaps were outstanding and as a result we will have exposure to fluctuations in variable interest rates for any future amounts borrowed under the revolving facility and our commercial paper program for a detailed discussion of our revolving facility and our commercial paper program see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements

​ 

at january 29 2021 our primary interest rate exposure was from changes in interest rates on our variable rate investment holdings which were classified as cash and cash equivalents in our consolidated financial statements the increase in cash and cash equivalents was driven primarily by our issuance of 15 billion of senior unsecured notes during the first quarter of 2020 as we sought to strengthen liquidity as a result of the continued uncertainty generated by the covid19 pandemic based on our variable rate cash investment balance of 11 billion at january 29 2021 the annualized effect of a 01 percentage point decrease in interest rates would have resulted in a pretax reduction of our earnings and cash flows of approximately 11 million in 2020 

​ 

at january 31 2020 our primary interest rate exposure was from changes in interest rates on our variable interest rate debt a change in interest rates on variable rate debt impacts our pretax earnings and cash flows whereas a change in interest rates on fixed rate debt impacts the economic fair value of debt but not our pretax earnings and cash flows based on our variable rate borrowing levels as of january 31 2020 the annualized effect of a one percentage point increase in variable interest rates would have resulted in a pretax reduction of our earnings and cash flows of approximately 43 million in 2019

 item 1 business 

​ 

general 

​ 

we are among the largest discount retailers in the united states by number of stores with 16368 stores located in 45 states as of february 28 2020 with the greatest concentration of stores in the southern southwestern midwestern and eastern united states we offer a broad selection of merchandise including consumable items seasonal items home products and apparel our merchandise includes national brands from leading manufacturers as well as our own private brand selections with prices at substantial discounts to national brands we offer our customers these national brand and private brand products at everyday low prices typically 10 or less in our convenient smallbox locations

​ 

our history 

​ 

jl turner founded our company in 1939 as jl turner and son wholesale we were incorporated as a kentucky corporation under the name jl turner  son inc in 1955 when we opened our first dollar general store we changed our name to dollar general corporation in 1968 and reincorporated in 1998 as a tennessee corporation our common stock was publicly traded from 1968 until july 2007 when we merged with an entity controlled by investment funds affiliated with kohlberg kravis roberts  co lp or kkr in november 2009 our common stock again became publicly traded on the new york stock exchange under the symbol “dg” and in december 2013 the entity controlled by investment funds affiliated with kkr sold its remaining shares of our common stock 

​ 

our business model 

​ 

our long history of profitable growth is founded on a commitment to a relatively simple business model providing a broad base of customers with their basic everyday and household needs supplemented with a variety of general merchandise items at everyday low prices in conveniently located smallbox stores we continually evaluate the needs and demands of our customers and modify our merchandise selections and pricing accordingly while remaining focused on increasing profitability cash generation and returns for our shareholders

​ 

our longterm operating priorities remain 1 driving profitable sales growth 2 capturing growth opportunities 3 enhancing our position as a lowcost operator and 4 investing in our people as a competitive advantage for more information on these operating priorities see the “executive overview” section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in part ii item 7 of this report 

​ 

in 2019 we achieved our 30th consecutive year of positive samestore sales growth we believe that this growth which has taken place in a variety of economic conditions is a result of our compelling value and convenience proposition although no assurances can be given that we will continue to achieve positive samestore sales growth in any given year 

​ 

compelling value and convenience proposition our ability to deliver highly competitive prices in convenient locations and our easy “in and out” shopping format create a compelling shopping experience that we believe distinguishes us from other discount retailers as well as convenience drug grocery online and mass merchant retailers our slogan “save time save money every day” summarizes our appeal to customers we believe our ability to effectively deliver both value and convenience allows us to succeed in small markets with 

limited shopping alternatives as well as in larger and more competitive markets our value and convenience proposition is evidenced by the following attributes of our business model 

​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

substantial growth opportunities we believe we have substantial longterm growth potential in the us and we have identified significant opportunities to add new stores in both existing and new markets in addition we have opportunities to relocate or remodel locations within our existing store base to better serve our customers our attractive store economics including a relatively low initial investment and simple lowcost operating model have allowed us to grow our store base to current levels and provide us significant opportunities to continue our profitable store growth strategy 

​ 

our merchandise 

​ 

we offer a focused assortment of everyday necessities which we believe helps to drive frequent customer visits and key items in a broad range of general merchandise categories our product assortment provides the opportunity for our customers to address most of their basic shopping needs with one trip we offer a wide selection of nationally advertised brands from leading manufacturers additionally our private brand products offer even greater value with options to purchase both products that are of comparable quality to national brands as well as opening price point items each at substantial discounts to the national brands

​ 

consumables is our largest merchandise category and has continued to become a larger percentage of our total sales as indicated in the table below consumables include paper and cleaning products such as paper towels bath tissue paper dinnerware trash and storage bags and laundry packaged food such as cereals canned soups and vegetables condiments spices sugar and flour perishables such as milk eggs bread refrigerated and frozen food beer and wine snacks such as candy cookies crackers salty snacks and carbonated beverages health and beauty such as overthecounter medicines and personal care products including soap body wash shampoo cosmetics dental hygiene and foot care products pet such as pet supplies and pet food and tobacco products

​ 

seasonal products include holiday items toys batteries small electronics greeting cards stationery prepaid phones and accessories gardening supplies hardware automotive and home office supplies

​ 

home products include kitchen supplies cookware small appliances light bulbs storage containers frames candles craft supplies and kitchen bed and bath soft goods

​ 

apparel includes casual everyday apparel for infants toddlers girls boys women and men as well as socks underwear disposable diapers shoes and accessories

​ 

the percentage of net sales of each of our four categories of merchandise for the fiscal years indicated below was as follows

​ 

 ​ 

our seasonal and home products categories typically account for the highest gross profit margins and the consumables category typically accounts for the lowest gross profit margin

​ 

the dollar general store 

​ 

the typical dollar general store is operated by a store manager one or more assistant store managers and three or more sales associates our stores generally feature a lowcost no frills building with limited maintenance capital low operating costs and a focused merchandise offering within a broad range of categories allowing us to deliver low retail prices while generating strong cash flows and capital investment returns our stores average approximately 7400 square feet of selling space and approximately 75 of our stores are located in towns of 20000 or fewer people we generally have had good success in locating suitable store sites in the past and we believe that there is ample opportunity for new store growth in existing and new markets in addition we believe we have significant opportunities available for our relocation and remodel programs

​ 

our store growth over the past three years is summarized in the following table

​ 

 ​ 

our customers 

​ 

our customers seek value and convenience depending on their financial situation and geographic proximity customers’ reliance on dollar general varies from fillin shopping to making periodic trips to stock up on household items to making weekly or more frequent trips to meet most essential needs we generally locate our stores and plan our merchandise selections to best serve the needs of our core customers the low and fixed income households often underserved by other retailers and we are focused on helping them make the most of their spending dollars at the same time however dollar general shoppers from a wide range of income brackets and life stages appreciate our quality merchandise as well as our attractive value and convenience proposition

​ 

our suppliers 

​ 

we purchase merchandise from a wide variety of suppliers and maintain direct buying relationships with many producers of national brand merchandise despite our broad offering we maintain only a limited number of items per category allowing us to keep our average costs low our two largest suppliers each accounted for 

approximately 8 of our purchases in 2019 our private brands come from a wide variety of suppliers we directly imported approximately 6 of our purchases at cost in 2019 

​ 

we consistently have been able to obtain sufficient quantities of core merchandise and believe that if one or more of our current sources of supply became unavailable we generally would be able to obtain alternative sources however such alternative sources could increase our merchandise costs and supply chain lead time and expenses result in a temporary reduction in store inventory levels reduce our selection or reduce the quality of our merchandise and an inability to obtain alternative sources could adversely affect our sales

​ 

distribution and transportation 

​ 

our stores are currently supported by distribution centers for nonrefrigerated merchandise located strategically throughout our geographic footprint we lease additional temporary warehouse space as necessary to support our distribution needs in addition to our traditional distribution centers we now operate multiple temperaturecontrolled distribution facilities in support of “dg fresh” our strategic multiphased shift to selfdistribution of frozen and refrigerated goods such as dairy deli and frozen products we regularly analyze and rebalance the network to ensure that it remains efficient and provides the service levels our stores require see “—properties” below for additional information pertaining to our distribution centers

​ 

most of our merchandise flows through our distribution centers and is delivered to our stores by thirdparty trucking firms utilizing our trailers we also own more than 300 semitrailer trucks with which we transport our merchandise in addition vendors or thirdparty distributors deliver or ship certain food items and other merchandise directly to our stores

​ 

seasonality 

​ 

our business is somewhat seasonal generally our most profitable sales mix occurs in the fourth quarter which includes the christmas selling season in addition our quarterly results can be affected by the timing of certain holidays new store openings remodels relocations and store closings we typically purchase substantial amounts of inventory and incur higher shipping and payroll costs in the third quarter in anticipation of increased sales activity during the fourth quarter see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information

​ 

our competition 

​ 

we operate in the basic discount consumer goods market which is highly competitive with respect to price customers store location merchandise quality assortment and presentation service offerings instock consistency customer service promotional activity employees and market share we compete with discount stores and many other retailers including mass merchandise warehouse club grocery drug convenience variety online and certain specialty stores these other retail companies operate stores in many of the areas where we operate and many of them engage in extensive advertising and marketing efforts our direct competitors include family dollar dollar tree big lots 99 cents only and various local independent operators as well as walmart target kroger aldi lidl walgreens cvs and riteaid among others certain of our competitors have greater financial distribution marketing and other resources than we do and may be able to secure better arrangements from suppliers than we can competition is intense and we believe it will continue to be so with certain competitors reducing their store locations while others move into or increase their presence in our geographic and product markets and increase the availability of mobile webbased and other digital technology to facilitate a more convenient and competitive customer online and instore shopping experience

​ 

we believe that we differentiate ourselves from other forms of retailing by offering consistently low prices in a convenient smallstore format we are able to maintain competitive prices due in part to our lowcost operating structure and the relatively limited assortment of products offered purchasing large volumes of merchandise within our focused assortment in each merchandise category allows us to keep our average product 

costs low contributing to our ability to offer competitive everyday low prices to our customers see “—our business model” above for further discussion of our competitive situation

​ 

our employees 

​ 

as of february 28 2020 we employed approximately 143000 fulltime and parttime employees including divisional and regional managers district managers store managers other store personnel and distribution center and administrative personnel we have increasingly focused on recruiting training motivating and retaining employees and we believe that the quality performance and morale of our employees continue to be an important part of our success in recent years we believe our overall relationship with our employees is good

​ 

our trademarks 

​ 

we own marks that are registered with the united states patent and trademark office and are protected under applicable intellectual property laws we attempt to obtain registration of our trademarks whenever practicable and to pursue vigorously any infringement of those marks our trademark registrations have various expiration dates however assuming that the trademark registrations are properly renewed they have a perpetual duration we also hold an exclusive license to the rexall brand through at least march 5 2026 and the believe beauty brand through at least march 23 2022

 item 1a risk factors 

investment in our company involves risks you should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information in this report and other filings that we make from time to time with the sec including our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations or liquidity these risks are not the only risks we face our business financial condition results of operations or liquidity could also be adversely affected by additional factors that apply to all companies generally or by risks not currently known to us or that we currently view to be immaterial we can provide no assurance and make no representation that our risk mitigation efforts although we believe they are reasonable will be successful

economic factors may reduce our customers’ spending impair our ability to execute our strategies and initiatives and increase our costs and expenses which could result in materially decreased sales or profitability 

many of our customers have fixed or low incomes and limited discretionary spending dollars any factor that could adversely affect their disposable income could decrease our customers’ spending or cause them to shift their spending to our lower margin product choices which could result in materially decreased sales and profitability factors that could reduce our customers’ disposable income include but are not limited to high unemployment or underemployment levels or decline in real wages inflation higher fuel energy healthcare and housing costs interest rates consumer debt levels and tax rates tax law changes that negatively affect credits and refunds lack of available credit and decreases in or elimination of government subsidies such as unemployment and food assistance programs

many of the economic factors listed above as well as commodity rates transportation lease and insurance costs wage rates foreign exchange rate fluctuations measures that create barriers to or increase the costs of international trade including increased import duties or tariffs changes in applicable laws and regulations and other economic factors also could impair our ability to successfully execute our strategies and initiatives as well as increase our cost of goods sold and selling general and administrative expenses including real estate costs and may have other adverse consequences that we are unable to fully anticipate or control all of which may materially decrease our sales or profitability 

our plans depend significantly on strategies and initiatives designed to increase sales and profitability and improve the efficiencies costs and effectiveness of our operations and failure to achieve or sustain these plans could materially affect our results of operations 

we have shortterm and longterm strategies and initiatives such as those relating to merchandising real estate and new store development store formats digital shrink sourcing private brand inventory management supply chain store operations expense reduction and technology in various stages of testing evaluation and implementation which are designed to continue to improve our results of operations and financial condition the effectiveness of these initiatives is inherently uncertain even when tested successfully and is dependent on consistency of training and execution workforce stability ease of execution and the absence of offsetting factors that can influence results adversely many of these factors are made even more challenging by the number and diverse geographic locations of our stores and distribution centers and our decentralized field management other risk factors described herein also could negatively affect general implementation failure to achieve successful or costeffective implementation of our initiatives could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition

the success of our merchandising initiatives particularly our nonconsumable initiatives and efforts to increase sales of higher margin products within the consumables category further depends in part upon our ability to predict the products that our customers will demand and to identify and timely respond to evolving trends in demographic mixes in our markets and consumer preferences if we are unable to select and timely obtain 

products that are attractive to customers and at costs that allow us to sell them at an acceptable profit or to effectively market such products it could result in materially decreased sales and profitability 

the success of our dg fresh initiative our cold chain selfdistribution initiative further depends in part on our ability to effectively transition these distribution operations from our current service providers without business disruption as well as on the availability of certain supply chain resources including temperaturecontrolled distribution centers refrigerated transportation equipment and drivers the success of our fast track initiative which is designed to enhance our instore labor productivity onshelf availability and customer convenience further depends in part on customer interest and adoption of selfcheckout our ability to gain cost efficiencies and control shrink levels from the initiative vendor cooperation and successful implementation and maintenance of the necessary technology 

if we cannot timely and costeffectively execute our real estate projects and meet our financial expectations or if we do not anticipate or successfully address the challenges imposed by our expansion including into new states or urban areas it could materially impede our planned future growth and our profitability 

delays in or failure to complete a significant portion of our real estate projects or failure to meet our financial expectations for these projects could materially adversely affect our growth and our profitability our ability to timely open relocate and remodel profitable stores and expand into additional market areas is a key component of our planned future growth and may depend in part on the availability of suitable store locations and capital funding the absence of entitlement process or occupancy delays including zoning restrictions and moratoria on small box discount retail development passed by local governments the ability to negotiate acceptable lease and development terms for example real estate development requirements and cost of building materials and labor to costeffectively hire and train new personnel especially store managers and to identify and accurately assess sufficient customer demand and general economic conditions 

we also may not anticipate or successfully address all of the challenges imposed by the expansion of our operations including into new states or urban areas where we have limited or no meaningful experience or brand recognition those areas may have different competitive and market conditions consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns than our existing markets as well as higher cost of entry and operating costs these factors may cause our new stores to be less profitable than stores in our existing markets which could slow future growth in these areas in addition many new stores will be located in areas where we have existing stores which inadvertently may temporarily or permanently divert a larger than anticipated number of customers and sales from our existing stores thereby adversely affecting our overall financial performance

we face intense competition that could limit our growth opportunities and materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

the retail business is highly competitive with respect to price customers store location merchandise quality product assortment and presentation service offerings instock consistency customer service ease of shopping experience promotional activity employees and market share we compete with discount stores and many other retailers including mass merchandise warehouse club grocery drug convenience variety online retailers and certain specialty stores to maintain our competitive position we may be required to lower prices either temporarily or permanently and may have limited ability to increase prices in response to increased costs resulting in lower margins and reduced profitability certain of our competitors have greater financial distribution marketing and other resources and may be able to secure better arrangements with suppliers than we can 

competition is intense and is expected to continue to be so with certain competitors reducing their store locations while others enter or increase their presence in our geographic and product markets including through the expansion of availability of delivery services and expand availability of mobile webbased and other digital 

technologies to facilitate a more convenient and competitive online and instore shopping experience if our competitors or others were to enter our industry in a significant way including through alliances or other business combinations it could significantly alter the competitive dynamics of the retail marketplace and result in competitors with greatly improved competitive positions which could materially affect our financial performance our ability to effectively compete will depend substantially upon our continued ability to develop and execute compelling and costeffective strategies and initiatives if we fail to anticipate or respond effectively to competitive pressures and industry changes it could materially affect our results of operations and financial condition

inventory shrinkage may negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we experience significant inventory shrinkage although some level of inventory shrinkage is an unavoidable cost of doing business higher rates of inventory shrinkage or increased security or other costs to combat inventory theft could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to reduce inventory shrinkage

our cash flows from operations profitability and financial condition may be negatively affected if we are not successful in managing our inventory balances 

our inventory balance represented approximately 55 of our total assets exclusive of goodwill operating lease assets and other intangible assets as of january 31 2020 efficient inventory management is a key component of our business success and profitability we must maintain sufficient inventory levels and an appropriate product mix to meet our customers’ demands without allowing those levels to increase such that the costs to store and hold the goods unduly impacts our financial results or increases the risk of inventory shrinkage if we do not accurately predict customer trends spending levels or price sensitivity we may have to take unanticipated markdowns to dispose of the excess inventory which also can adversely affect our financial results we continue to focus on ways to reduce these risks but we cannot make assurances that we will be successful in our inventory management if we are not successful in managing our inventory balances our cash flows from operations and financial condition may be negatively affected

failure to maintain the security of our business customer employee or vendor information or to comply with privacy laws could expose us to litigation government enforcement actions and costly response measures and could materially harm our reputation and affect our business and financial performance 

in connection with sales we transmit confidential credit and debit card information which is encrypted using pointtopoint encryption we also have access to collect or maintain certain private or confidential information regarding our customers employees and their dependents and vendors as well as our business some of this information is stored electronically in connection with our ecommerce and mobile applications some of which may leverage thirdparty service providers additionally we may share information with select vendors that assist us in conducting our business while we have implemented procedures and technology intended to protect such information and require appropriate controls of our service providers cyberattackers could compromise such controls and obtain such information as cyberattacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated and do not always immediately produce signs of intrusion moreover inadvertent or malicious employee actions could result in a defeat of security measures and compromise our or our thirdparty vendors’ information systems like other retailers we and our vendors have experienced threats to data and systems including by perpetrators of attempted random or targeted malicious cyberattacks computer viruses worms bot attacks or other destructive or disruptive software and attempts to misappropriate our information and cause system failures and disruptions if cyberattackers obtain customer employee or vendor passwords through unrelated thirdparty breaches these passwords could be used to gain access to their information or accounts with us

because we accept debit and credit cards for payment we are subject to industry data protection standards and protocols such as the payment card industry data security standards issued by the payment card 

industry security standards council nonetheless we may be vulnerable to and unable to detect and appropriately respond to data security breaches and data loss including cybersecurity attacks or other breaches of cardholder data 

a significant security breach of any kind experienced by us or one of our vendors which could be undetected for a period of time or a significant failure by us or one of our vendors to comply with applicable privacy and information security laws regulations and standards could expose us to risks of data loss litigation government enforcement actions fines or penalties credit card brand assessments negative publicity and reputational harm business disruption and costly response measures for example providing notification to and credit monitoring services for affected individuals as well as further upgrades to our security measures which may not be covered by or may exceed the coverage limits of our insurance policies and could materially disrupt our operations any resulting negative publicity could significantly harm our reputation which could cause us to lose market share as a result of customers discontinuing the use of our ecommerce and mobile applications or debit or credit cards in our stores or not shopping in our stores altogether and could materially adversely affect our business and financial performance

material damage or interruptions to our information systems as a result of external factors staffing shortages or challenges in maintaining or updating our existing technology or developing or implementing new technology could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we depend on a variety of information technology systems including systems owned and managed by thirdparty vendors for the efficient functioning of our business including without limitation transaction processing and the management of our employees facilities logistics inventories stores and customerfacing digital applications and operations our technology initiatives may not deliver desired results or may do so on a delayed schedule additionally such systems are subject to damage or interruption from power surges and outages facility damage physical theft computer and telecommunications failures inadequate or ineffective redundancy malicious code including computer viruses worms ransomware or similar cyberattacks including account compromise phishing denial of service attacks and application network or system vulnerability exploitation software upgrade failures or code defects natural disasters and human error design defects or damage or interruption to these systems may require a significant investment to fix or replace disrupt our operations result in the loss or corruption of critical data and harm our reputation all of which could materially adversely affect our business or results of operations 

we also rely heavily on our information technology staff failure to meet these staffing needs may negatively affect our ability to fulfill our technology initiatives while continuing to provide maintenance on existing systems we rely on third parties to maintain and periodically upgrade many of these systems so that they can continue to support our business we license the software programs supporting many of our systems from independent software developers the inability of these vendors developers or us to continue to maintain and upgrade these systems and software programs could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations if we were unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner and could expose us to greater risk of a cyberattack in addition costs and delays associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology including the migration of applications to the cloud or with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems also could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations fail to operate as designed result in the potential loss or corruption of data or information disrupt operations and affect our ability to meet business and reporting requirements and adversely affect our profitability

​ 

a significant disruption to our distribution network the capacity of our distribution centers or the timely receipt of inventory could adversely affect sales or increase our transportation costs which would decrease our profitability 

we rely on our distribution and transportation network to provide goods to our stores timely and cost effectively using various transportation modes including ocean rail and truck we and our vendors move goods from vendor locations to our distribution centers and our stores any disruption unanticipated or unusual expense or operational failure related to this process for example delivery delays including as a result of pandemic outbreaks or increases in transportation costs including increased fuel costs import freight costs carrier or driver wages as a result of driver shortages a decrease in transportation capacity for overseas shipments labor shortages or work stoppages for slowdowns could negatively impact sales and profits labor shortages or work stoppages in the transportation industry or disruptions to the national and international transportation infrastructure that lead to delivery delays or that necessitate our securing alternative labor or shipping suppliers could also increase our costs or otherwise negatively affect our business the recent outbreak of the strain of covid19 has led various governments to take precautionary measures to limit the spread of the virus including port closures and other restrictions which could disrupt the global transportation and distribution of goods resulting in product delivery delays or higher delivery prices as of the date of this filing we do not anticipate that supply chain disruptions either known or experienced to date as a result of the covid19 outbreak are likely to have a material impact on our financial results in 2020 however the extent to which the covid19 outbreak may impact our distribution network results of operations including sales or business in the future is uncertain as the situation continues to evolve and such impact could be more significant 

we maintain a network of distribution facilities and are moving forward with plans to build or lease new facilities to support our growth objectives and strategic initiatives delays in opening such facilities could adversely affect our financial performance by slowing store growth or the rollout of certain strategic initiatives such as our dg fresh initiative which may in turn reduce revenue growth or by increasing transportation and product costs in addition distributionrelated construction or expansion projects entail risks that could cause delays and cost overruns such as shortages of materials or skilled labor work stoppages unforeseen construction scheduling engineering environmental or geological problems weather interference fires or other casualty losses and unanticipated cost increases for these reasons the completion date and ultimate cost of these projects could differ significantly from initial expectations and we cannot guarantee that any project will be completed on time or within established budgets

risks associated with or faced by our suppliers could adversely affect our financial performance 

we source our merchandise from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers and we depend on them to supply merchandise in a timely and efficient manner in 2019 our two largest suppliers each accounted for approximately 8 of our purchases if one or more of our current sources of supply became unavailable we believe we generally would be able to obtain alternative sources but it could increase our merchandise costs and supply chain lead time result in a temporary reduction in store inventory levels and reduce the selection and quality of our merchandise an inability to obtain alternative sources could materially decrease our sales additionally if a supplier fails to deliver on its commitments we could experience merchandise outofstocks that could lead to lost sales and reputational harm further failure of suppliers to meet our compliance protocols could prolong our procurement lead time resulting in lost sales and adverse margin impact

we directly imported approximately 6 of our purchases measured at cost in 2019 but many of our domestic vendors directly import their products or components of their products changes to the prices and flow of these goods for any reason such as political unrest acts of war currency fluctuations disruptions in maritime lanes port labor disputes economic conditions and instability in countries in which foreign suppliers are located the financial instability of suppliers failure to meet our standards issues with our suppliers’ labor practices or labor problems they may experience such as strikes stoppages or slowdowns which could also increase labor costs during and following the disruption the availability and cost of raw materials pandemic outbreaks merchandise quality or safety issues transport availability and cost increases in wage rates and taxes transport 

security inflation and other factors relating to suppliers and the countries in which they are located or from which they import often are beyond our control and could adversely affect our operations and profitability 

while we are working to diversify our sources of imported goods a substantial amount of our imported merchandise comes from china and thus a change in the chinese leadership the effects of pandemic outbreaks including covid19 economic and market conditions internal economic stimulus actions or currency or other policies as well as trade relations between china and the united states and increases in costs of labor and wage taxes could negatively impact our merchandise costs we currently expect delays in the receipt of certain goods as a result of the covid19 outbreak but as of the date of this filing we do not anticipate that these known supply chain disruptions experienced to date as a result of the covid19 outbreak are likely to have a material impact on our financial results in 2020 however the extent to which the covid19 outbreak may impact our supply chain results of operations including sales or business in the future is uncertain as the situation continues to evolve and such impact could be more significant in addition the united states’ foreign trade policies duties tariffs and other impositions on imported goods trade sanctions imposed on certain countries particularly china import limitations on certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade and port labor agreements are beyond our control these and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our business and financial performance if we increase our product imports from foreign vendors the risks associated with these imports also will increase and we may be exposed to additional or different risks as we increase imports of goods produced in countries other than china 

product liability product recall or other product safety or labeling claims could adversely affect our business reputation and financial performance 

we are dependent on our vendors to ensure that the products we buy from them comply with applicable product safety and labeling laws and regulations and to inform us of all applicable restrictions on the sale of such products nonetheless product liability personal injury or other claims may be asserted against us relating to product contamination tampering expiration mislabeling recall and other safety or labeling issues including those relating to products that we may selfdistribute through our dg fresh initiative 

we seek but may not be successful in obtaining contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from our vendors if we do not have adequate contractual indemnification or insurance available such claims could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations our ability to obtain indemnification from foreign vendors may be hindered by our ability to obtain jurisdiction over them to enforce contractual obligations even with adequate insurance and indemnification such claims could significantly harm our reputation and consumer confidence in our products and we could incur significant litigation expenses which also could materially affect our results of operations even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or not fully pursued

a significant change in governmental regulations and requirements could materially increase our cost of doing business and noncompliance with governmental regulations could materially adversely affect our financial performance 

we routinely incur significant costs in complying with numerous and frequently changing laws and regulations the complexity of this regulatory environment and related compliance costs are increasing due to additional legal and regulatory requirements our expanding operations and increased regulatory scrutiny and enforcement efforts new or revised laws regulations policies and related interpretations and enforcement practices particularly those dealing with environmental compliance product and food safety or labeling information security and privacy labor and employment employee wages and those governing the sale of products may significantly increase our expenses or require extensive system and operating changes that could materially increase our cost of doing business violations of applicable laws and regulations or untimely or incomplete execution of a required product recall can result in significant penalties including loss of licenses eligibility to accept certain government benefits such as snap or significant fines class action or other litigation 

and reputational damage additionally changes in tax laws the interpretation of existing laws or our failure to sustain our reporting positions on examination could adversely affect our overall effective tax rate

legal proceedings may adversely affect our reputation business results of operations and financial condition 

our business is subject to the risk of litigation or other legal proceedings by employees consumers suppliers competitors shareholders government agencies and others through private actions class actions multidistrict litigation arbitrations derivative actions administrative proceedings regulatory actions or other litigation for example we are involved in certain legal proceedings as discussed in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements the outcome of legal proceedings particularly class action or multidistrict litigation or mass arbitrations and regulatory actions can be difficult to assess or quantify plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts and the magnitude of the potential loss may remain unknown for lengthy periods in addition certain of these matters if decided adversely to us or settled by us may result in liability material to our financial statements as a whole or may negatively affect our operating results if changes to our business operations are required and sometimes these developments are unanticipated legal proceedings in general and class actions multidistrict litigation and derivative actions in particular can be expensive and disruptive and adverse publicity could harm our reputation regardless of the validity of the allegations as a result legal proceedings may adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition see also note 7 to the consolidated financial statements

our current insurance program may expose us to unexpected costs and negatively affect our financial performance 

our insurance coverage reflects deductibles selfinsured retentions limits of liability and similar provisions that we believe are prudent based on our operations however there are types of losses we may incur but against which we cannot be insured or which we believe are not economically reasonable to insure such as losses due to acts of war certain crimes including employee crime certain wage and hour and other employmentrelated claims and litigation actions based on certain consumer protection laws and some natural and other disasters or similar events if we incur material uninsured losses our financial performance could suffer certain material events may result in sizable losses for the insurance industry and adversely affect the availability of adequate insurance coverage or result in excessive premium increases to offset negative insurance market trends we may elect to selfinsure accept higher deductibles or reduce the amount of coverage in addition we selfinsure a significant portion of expected losses under our workers’ compensation automobile liability general liability including claims made against certain of our landlords and group health insurance programs significant changes in actuarial assumptions and management estimates underlying our recorded liabilities for these losses including expected increases in medical and indemnity costs could result in materially different expenses than expected under these programs which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition although we maintain property insurance for catastrophic events at our store support center and distribution centers we are effectively selfinsured for other property losses if we experience a greater number of these losses than we anticipate our financial performance could be adversely affected

natural disasters and unusual weather conditions whether or not caused by climate change pandemic outbreaks or other health crises acts of violence or terrorism and global political events could disrupt business and result in lower sales and otherwise adversely affect our financial performance 

the occurrence of one or more natural disasters such as hurricanes fires floods tornadoes and earthquakes unusual weather conditions pandemic outbreaks or other health crises including but not limited to the covid19 outbreak acts of violence or terrorism including within our stores distribution centers or other company property or disruptive global political events such as civil unrest in countries in which our suppliers are located or similar disruptions could adversely affect our reputation business and financial performance if any of these events result in the closure of one or more of our distribution centers a significant number of stores or our corporate headquarters or impact one or more of our key suppliers our operations and financial 

performance could be materially adversely affected through an inability to make deliveries or provide other support functions to our stores and through lost sales these events also could affect consumer shopping patterns or prevent customers from reaching our stores which could lead to lost sales and higher markdowns or result in increases in fuel or other energy prices a fuel shortage store or distribution center opening delays the temporary lack of an adequate work force in a market the temporary or longterm disruption of product availability in our stores the temporary or longterm inability to obtain technology needed to effectively run our business and disruption of our utility services or information systems these events may also increase the costs of insurance if they result in significant loss of property or other insurable damage 

failure to attract train and retain qualified employees while controlling labor costs as well as other labor issues could adversely affect our financial performance 

our future growth and performance positive customer experience and legal and regulatory compliance depends on our ability to attract train retain and motivate qualified employees while operating in an industry challenged by historically high rates of employee turnover our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling our labor costs is subject to many external factors including competition for and availability of qualified personnel unemployment levels wage rates minimum wage laws health and other insurance costs changes in employment and labor laws or other workplace regulations including changes in employee benefit programs such as health insurance and paid leave programs employee activism and our reputation and relevance within the labor market if we are unable to attract train and retain adequate numbers of qualified employees our operations customer service levels legal and regulatory compliance and support functions could suffer in addition to the extent a significant portion of our employee base unionizes or attempts to unionize our labor and other related costs could increase our ability to pass along labor and other related costs to our customers is constrained by our everyday low price model and we may not be able to offset such increased costs elsewhere in our business

our success depends on our executive officers and other key personnel if we lose key personnel or are unable to hire additional qualified personnel our business may be harmed 

our future success depends to a significant degree on the skills experience and efforts of our executive officers and other key personnel the unexpected loss of the services of any of such persons could adversely affect our operations there can be no assurance that our executive succession planning retention or hiring efforts will be successful competition for skilled and experienced management personnel is intense and our future success will also depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and a failure to attract and retain new qualified personnel could adversely affect our operations 

our private brands may not be successful in improving our gross profit rate and may increase certain of the risks we face 

the sale of private brand items is an important component of our sales growth and gross profit rate enhancement plans broad market acceptance of our private brands depends on many factors including pricing quality customer perception and timely development and introduction of new products we cannot give assurance that we will achieve or maintain our expected level of private brand sales the sale and expansion of these offerings also subjects us to or increases certain risks such as product liability claims and product recalls disruptions in raw material and finished product supply and distribution chains inability to successfully protect our proprietary rights claims related to the proprietary rights of third parties and other risks generally encountered by entities that source sell and market exclusive branded offerings for retail failure to appropriately address these risks could materially adversely affect our private brand initiatives reputation results of operations and financial condition

because our business is somewhat seasonal adverse events during the fourth quarter could materially affect our financial statements as a whole 

primarily because of sales of christmasrelated merchandise our most profitable sales mix generally occurs in the fourth quarter in anticipation of this holiday we purchase substantial amounts of seasonal inventory and if sales fall below seasonal norms or our expectations it could result in unanticipated markdowns adverse events such as deteriorating economic conditions high unemployment rates high gas prices transportation disruptions or unusual or unanticipated adverse weather could result in lowerthanplanned sales during the christmas selling season which in turn could reduce our profitability and otherwise adversely affect our financial performance and operating results 

deterioration in market conditions or changes in our credit profile could adversely affect our business operations and financial condition 

we rely on the positive cash flow we generate from our operating activities and our access to the credit and capital markets to fund our operations growth strategy and return of cash to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends changes in the credit and capital markets including market disruptions limited liquidity and interest rate fluctuations may increase the cost of financing or restrict our access to these potential sources of future liquidity our continued access to liquidity sources on favorable terms depends on multiple factors including our operating performance and credit ratings our debt securities currently are rated investment grade and a downgrade of this rating likely would negatively impact our access to the debt capital markets and increase our cost of borrowing as a result disruptions in the debt markets or any downgrade of our credit ratings could adversely affect our business operations and financial condition and our ability to return cash to our shareholders we can make no assurances that our ability to obtain additional financing through the debt markets will not be adversely affected by economic conditions or that we will be able to maintain or improve our current credit ratings

new accounting guidance or changes in the interpretation or application of existing accounting guidance could adversely affect our financial performance 

the implementation of new accounting standards could require certain systems internal process and controls and other changes that could increase our operating costs and will result in changes to our financial statements in 2019 for example the implementation of accounting standards related to leases as issued by the financial accounting standards board required us to make significant changes to our lease management and other accounting systems and resulted in a material impact to our consolidated financial statements 

us generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by our management changes in these rules or their interpretation or in underlying management assumptions estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance the outcome of such changes could include litigation or regulatory actions which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

​ 

executive overview 

​ 

we are among the largest discount retailers in the united states by number of stores with 16368 stores located in 45 states as of february 28 2020 with the greatest concentration of stores in the southern southwestern midwestern and eastern united states we offer a broad selection of merchandise including consumable products such as food paper and cleaning products health and beauty products and pet supplies and nonconsumable products such as seasonal merchandise home decor and domestics and basic apparel our merchandise includes national brands from leading manufacturers as well as our own private brand selections with prices at substantial discounts to national brands we offer our customers these national brand and private brand products at everyday low prices typically 10 or less in our convenient smallbox locations

​ 

we believe our convenient store formats locations and broad selection of highquality products at compelling values have driven our substantial growth and financial success over the years and through a variety of economic cycles we are mindful that the majority of our customers are valueconscious and many have low andor fixed incomes as a result we are intensely focused on helping our customers make the most of their spending dollars our core customers are often among the first to be affected by negative or uncertain economic conditions and among the last to feel the effects of improving economic conditions particularly when trends are inconsistent and of an uncertain duration the primary macroeconomic factors that affect our core customers include the unemployment and underemployment rates wage growth changes in us and global trade policy including price increases from tariffs and changes to certain government assistance programs such as the supplemental nutrition assistance program additionally our customers are impacted by increases in those expenses that generally comprise a large portion of their household budget such as rent healthcare and fuel prices finally significant unseasonable or unusual weather patterns can impact customer shopping behaviors 

​ 

we remain committed to the following longterm operating priorities as we consistently strive to improve our performance while retaining our customercentric focus 1 driving profitable sales growth 2 capturing growth opportunities 3 enhancing our position as a lowcost operator and 4 investing in our people as a competitive advantage

​ 

we seek to drive profitable sales growth through initiatives aimed at increasing customer traffic and average transaction amount as we work to provide everyday low prices and meet our customers’ affordability needs we remain focused on enhancing our margins through effective category management inventory shrink reduction initiatives private brands penetration distribution and transportation efficiencies global sourcing and pricing and markdown optimization several of our salesdriving initiatives are also designed to capture growth opportunities and are discussed in more detail below

​ 

historically our sales of consumables which tend to have lower gross margins have been the key drivers of net sales and customer traffic while sales of nonconsumables which tend to have higher gross margins have contributed to more profitable sales growth and an increase in average transaction amount our sales mix has continued to shift slightly toward consumables and within consumables slightly toward lower margin departments such as perishables while we expect some sales mix challenges to persist certain of our initiatives are intended to address these trends although there can be no assurance we will be successful in reversing them

​ 

we continue to make progress on and invest in certain strategic initiatives that we believe will help drive profitable sales growth and capture longterm growth opportunities such opportunities include leveraging existing and developing new digital tools and technology to provide our customers with additional shopping access points and even greater convenience additionally our refreshed approach to our nonconsumable product offerings has been implemented in approximately 2400 stores as of the end of 2019 this merchandising strategy which is continuing to evolve and help shape our approach to nonconsumable categories throughout the chain offers a new differentiated and limited assortment that will change throughout the year as we extend this initiative more broadly as well as incorporate certain related merchandising efforts throughout our chain our goal is to continue to improve the shopping experience while delivering exceptional value within key areas of our nonconsumable categories 

​ 

we are continuing our rollout of the “dg fresh” initiative a selfdistribution model for fresh and frozen products that is designed to enhance sales reduce product costs improve our instock position and enhance item assortment we currently operate five dg fresh distribution facilities which served more than 6000 stores as of february 28 2020 

​ 

tariffs on products from china as applied to both our direct imports and domestic purchases did not have a net material impact on our financial results in 2019 we believe we can mitigate the potential sales and margin impact of such increased tariffs on our financial results in 2020 through various sourcing merchandising and pricing efforts however as noted above changes in trade policy that result in higher prices for our customers may negatively impact their budgets and consequently their spending and additional increases in tariff rates or expansion of products subject to tariffs may have a more significant impact on our future business there can be no assurance we will be successful in our efforts to mitigate the impacts of existing or future tariffs in whole or in part including but not limited to any impacts on customer spending 

​ 

we have limited insight into the extent to which our business may be impacted by the covid19 coronavirus outbreak and there are many unknowns while we currently expect delays in the receipt of certain goods in 2020 as a result of this outbreak we do not currently anticipate a material impact to our financial results in 2020 due to these delays further delays in the receipt of goods or other unanticipated impacts to our supply chain including on direct imports or goods purchased domestically our stores or our customers could have a more significant impact on our future business including sales and we are continuing to monitor this evolving situation

to support our other operating priorities we remain focused on capturing growth opportunities in 2019 we opened 975 new stores remodeled 1024 stores and relocated 100 stores for 2020 we plan to open approximately 1000 new stores remodel approximately 1500 stores and relocate approximately 80 stores for a total of 2580 real estate projects 

​ 

we continue to innovate within our channel and are able to utilize the most productive of our various store formats based on the specific market opportunity we expect that our traditional 7300 square foot store format will continue to be the primary store layout for new stores in 2020 we expect approximately 1125 of the planned 1500 remodels in 2020 to use a highercoolercount store format that enables us to offer an increased selection of perishable items with the traditional store format the primary store layout for the remainder of the real estate projects additionally the majority of both new stores and remodels will incorporate highercapacity coolers the acceleration of remodels in 2020 and the increased usage of the highercoolercount formats is expected to allow us to capture additional growth opportunities within our existing markets in addition our smaller format store less than 6000 square feet is expected to allow us to capture growth opportunities in urban areas we continue to incorporate lessons learned from our various store formats and layouts into our existing store base with a goal of driving increased customer traffic average transaction amount samestore sales and overall store productivity 

​ 

to support our new store growth and drive productivity we have continued to make investments in our traditional distribution center network for nonrefrigerated merchandise we began shipping from our distribution centers in longview texas and amsterdam new york in january 2019 and december 2019 respectively 

​ 

we have established a position as a lowcost operator always seeking ways to reduce or control costs that do not affect our customers’ shopping experiences we plan to continue enhancing this position over time while employing ongoing cost discipline to reduce certain expenses as a percentage of sales nonetheless we seek to maintain flexibility to invest in the business as necessary to enhance our longterm profitability

​ 

we also have launched “fast track” an initiative aimed at further enhancing our convenience proposition and instock position as well as increasing labor productivity within our stores the first phase of fast track involved sorting process optimization within our distribution centers as well as increased shelfready packaging to allow for greater storelevel stocking efficiencies followed by the secondphase pilot of a selfcheckout option in a limited number of stores we have completed the sorting process optimization at all of our nonrefrigerated distribution centers additionally we have launched the selfcheckout pilot in a select number of stores these and certain other strategic initiatives will require us to incur upfront expenses for which in some respects there may not be an immediate or acceptable return in terms of sales or enhanced profitability 

​ 

certain of our operating expenses such as wage rates and occupancy costs have continued to increase in recent years due primarily to market forces while we expect these increases to persist certain of our initiatives and plans are intended to help offset these challenges although there can be no assurance we will be successful in mitigating them

​ 

our employees are a competitive advantage and we proactively seek ways to continue investing in them our goal is to create an environment that attracts and retains talented personnel particularly at the store level because employees who are promoted from within our company generally have longer tenures and are greater contributors to improvements in our financial performance we believe our investments in compensation and training for our store managers have contributed to improved customer experience scores higher sales and improved turnover metrics 

​ 

to further enhance shareholder returns we repurchased shares of our common stock and paid quarterly cash dividends throughout 2019 in 2020 we intend to continue our share repurchase activity and to pay quarterly cash dividends subject to board discretion and approval

​ 

we utilize key performance indicators “kpis” in the management of our business our kpis include samestore sales average sales per square foot and inventory turnover samestore sales are calculated based upon stores that were open at least 13 full fiscal months and remain open at the end of the reporting period we include stores that have been remodeled expanded or relocated in our samestore sales calculation changes in samestore sales are calculated based on the comparable 52 calendar weeks in the current and prior years net sales per square foot is calculated based on total sales for the preceding 12 months as of the ending date of the reporting period divided by the average selling square footage during the period including the end of the fiscal year the beginning of the fiscal year and the end of each of our three interim fiscal quarters inventory turnover is calculated based on total cost of goods sold for the preceding four quarters divided by the average inventory balance as of the ending date of the reporting period including the end of the fiscal year the beginning of the fiscal year and the end of each of our three interim fiscal quarters each of these measures is commonly used by investors in retail companies to measure the health of the business we use these measures to maximize profitability and for decisions about the allocation of resources

​ 

a continued focus on our four operating priorities as discussed above coupled with strong cash flow management and share repurchases resulted in solid overall operating and financial performance in 2019 as 

compared to 2018 as set forth below basis points as referred to below are equal to 001 as a percentage of net sales

results of operations 

​ 

accounting periods the following text contains references to years 2019 2018 and 2017 which represent fiscal years ended january 31 2020 february 1 2019 and february 2 2018 respectively our fiscal year ends on the friday closest to january 31 fiscal years 2019 2018 and 2017 were each 52week accounting periods

​ 

seasonality  the nature of our business is somewhat seasonal primarily because of sales of christmasrelated merchandise operating profit in our fourth quarter november december and january has historically been higher than operating profit achieved in each of the first three quarters of the fiscal year expenses and to a greater extent operating profit vary by quarter results of a period shorter than a full year may not be indicative of results expected for the entire year furthermore the seasonal nature of our business may affect comparisons between periods

​ 

the following table contains results of operations data for fiscal years 2019 2018 and 2017 and the dollar and percentage variances among those years

​ 

 ​ 

net sales  the net sales increase in 2019 reflects a samestore sales increase of 39 compared to 2018 in 2019 our 15209 samestores accounted for sales of 264 billion the increase in samestore sales primarily reflects an increase in average transaction amount and customer traffic compared to 2018 the increase in average transaction amount was driven by higher average item retail prices samestore sales in 2019 increased in each of the consumables seasonal and home products and apparel categories compared to 2018 the 2019 net sales increase was positively affected by new stores modestly offset by sales from closed stores

​ 

the net sales increase in 2018 reflects a samestore sales increase of 32 compared to 2017 in 2018 our 14283 samestores accounted for sales of 239 billion the increase in samestore sales primarily reflects an increase in average transaction amount relative to 2017 the increase in average transaction amount was driven by higher average item retail prices and to a lesser extent an increase in average items per transaction while customer traffic was essentially unchanged samestore sales in 2018 increased in the consumables seasonal and home products categories and declined in the apparel category compared to 2017 samestore sales results in 2018 for the three nonconsumables categories when aggregated were positive the 2018 net sales increase was positively affected by new stores modestly offset by sales from closed stores

​ 

of our four major merchandise categories the consumables category which generally has a lower gross profit rate than the other three categories is our largest category and has continued to become a larger percentage 

of our total sales because of the impact of sales mix on gross profit we continually review our merchandise mix and strive to adjust it when appropriate 

​ 

gross profit in 2019 gross profit increased by 88 and as a percentage of net sales increased by 14 basis points to 306 compared to 2018 higher initial markups on inventory purchases and a lower lifo provision contributed to the increase in the gross profit rate these factors were partially offset by increased distribution and transportation costs a greater proportion of sales of consumables which generally have a lower gross profit rate than our other product categories and sales of lower margin products comprising a higher proportion of consumables sales as well as a higher rate of inventory shrinkage 

​ 

in 2018 gross profit increased by 81 and as a percentage of net sales decreased by 32 basis points to 305 compared to 2017 higher markdowns a greater proportion of sales of consumables which generally have a lower gross profit rate than our other product categories and sales of lower margin products comprising a higher proportion of consumables sales as well as increases in transportation costs and an increased lifo provision reduced the gross profit rate these factors were partially offset by an improved rate of inventory shrinkage and higher initial markups on inventory purchases 

​ 

sga sga as a percentage of sales was 223 in 2019 compared to 222 in 2018 an increase of 9 basis points we recorded expenses of 310 million in 2019 reflecting our estimate for the settlement of significant legal matters discussed in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements sga in 2019 included a decrease of approximately 228 million in hurricane and other disasterrelated expenses compared to 2018 as well as an increase in retail labor costs at a rate less than the increase in net sales 

​ 

sga as a percentage of sales decreased by 1 basis point rounding to 222 in both 2018 and 2017 the 2018 amounts reflect a reduction in repairs and maintenance expenses which were offset by occupancy costs and depreciation expenses each of which increased at a rate greater than the increase in net sales the 2018 amounts reflect an increase in hurricane and other disasterrelated expenses of approximately 143 million compared to 2017 the 2017 amounts include costs of 240 million related to the closure of 35 underperforming stores primarily expenses for remaining lease liabilities 

​ 

interest expense  interest expense increased 07 million to 1006 million in 2019 compared to 2018 and increased 28 million to 999 million in 2018 compared to 2017 see the detailed discussion under “liquidity and capital resources” regarding the financing of various longterm obligations 

​ 

we had consolidated outstanding variablerate debt of 4301 million and 3733 million as of january 31 2020 and february 1 2019 respectively and the remainder of our outstanding indebtedness as of each of those dates was fixed rate debt 

​ 

other income expense  other income expense in 2018 reflects expenses associated with the voluntary prepayment of our senior unsecured term loan facility and in 2017 reflects expenses associated with the issuance and refinancing of longterm debt

​ 

income taxes  the effective income tax rate for 2019 was 222 compared to a rate of 211 for 2018 which represents a net increase of 11 percentage points the effective income tax rate was higher in 2019 primarily due to an increase in income taxes resulting from changes in state income tax laws and a federal income tax benefit arising from the tax cuts and jobs act the “tcja” in 2018 that did not reoccur in 2019 

​ 

the effective income tax rate for 2018 was 211 compared to a rate of 193 for 2017 which represents a net increase of 18 percentage points the effective income tax rate was higher in 2018 primarily due to the onetime remeasurement of the federal portion of our deferred tax assets and liabilities at 21 in 2017 which was offset by the reduction in the current federal tax rate from 337 in 2017 to 21 in 2018 

​ 

our 2017 provision for income taxes reflected an estimate due to the changes in the federal income tax law arising from the tcja signed into law on december 22 2017 the provisional tax benefit consisted of 3108 million related to the onetime remeasurement of the federal portion of our deferred tax assets and liabilities at the 21 rate and 242 million related to the reduced statutory tax rate of 337 compared to 35 in prior years subsequent to the signing of the tcja the securities and exchange commission staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 “sab 118” which allowed companies to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year after the enactment date while the accounting impact is still under analysis in 2018 we concluded our analysis of the accounting impact of the tcja pursuant to sab 118 and recorded immaterial adjustments related to our 2017 provision for income taxes 

​ 

off balance sheet arrangements 

​ 

we are not party to any material off balance sheet arrangements

​ 

effects of inflation 

​ 

in 2019 and 2018 we experienced increases in product costs due in part to tariffs on certain items imported from china we experienced minimal overall commodity cost inflation or deflation in 2017 

​ 

liquidity and capital resources 

​ 

current financial condition and recent developments 

​ 

during the past three years we have generated an aggregate of approximately 62 billion in cash flows from operating activities and incurred approximately 22 billion in capital expenditures during that period we expanded the number of stores we operate by 2958 representing growth of approximately 22 and we remodeled or relocated 3053 stores or approximately 23 of the stores we operated as of the beginning of the threeyear period in 2020 we intend to continue our current strategy of pursuing store growth remodels and relocations

​ 

at january 31 2020 we had a 125 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement the “revolving facility” 25 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes and a commercial paper program that may provide borrowing availability of up to 10 billion at january 31 2020 we had total consolidated outstanding debt including the current portion of longterm obligations of 29 billion which includes commercial paper borrowings “cp notes” and senior notes all of which are described in greater detail below our borrowing availability under the revolving facility may be effectively limited by our cp notes as further described below the information contained in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii item 8 of this report is incorporated herein by reference 

​ 

we believe our cash flow from operations and our existing cash balances combined with availability under the revolving facility cp notes and access to the debt markets will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our current obligations projected working capital requirements capital spending and anticipated dividend payments for a period that includes the next twelve months as well as the next several years however our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity may be affected by numerous factors many of which are outside of our control depending on our liquidity levels conditions in the capital markets and other factors we may from time to time consider the issuance of debt equity or other securities the proceeds of which could provide additional liquidity for our operations 

​ 

for fiscal 2020 we anticipate potential combined borrowings under the revolving facility and cp notes to be a maximum of approximately 800 million outstanding at any one time including any anticipated borrowings to fund repurchases of common stock

​ 

revolving credit facility 

​ 

on september 10 2019 we entered into the revolving facility consisting of a 125 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility of which up to 1750 million is available for the issuance of letters of credit and which is scheduled to mature on september 10 2024 

​ 

borrowings under the revolving facility bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable interest rate margin plus at our option either a libor or b a base rate which is usually equal to the prime rate the applicable interest rate margin for borrowings as of january 31 2020 was 1015 for libor borrowings and 0015 for baserate borrowings we must also pay a facility fee payable on any used and unused commitment amounts of the revolving facility and customary fees on letters of credit issued under the revolving facility as of january 31 2020 the facility fee rate was 011 the applicable interest rate margins for borrowings the facility fees and the letter of credit fees under the revolving facility are subject to adjustment from time to time based on our longterm senior unsecured debt ratings 

​ 

the revolving facility contains a number of customary affirmative and negative covenants that among other things restrict subject to certain exceptions our including our subsidiaries’ ability to incur additional liens sell all or substantially all of our assets consummate certain fundamental changes or change in our lines of business and incur additional subsidiary indebtedness the revolving facility also contains financial covenants that require the maintenance of a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio as of january 31 2020 we were in compliance with all such covenants the revolving facility also contains customary events of default 

​ 

as of january 31 2020 under the revolving facility we had no outstanding borrowings outstanding letters of credit of 54 million and borrowing availability of 124 billion that due to our intention to maintain borrowing availability related to the commercial paper program described below could contribute incremental liquidity of 6384 million at january 31 2020 in addition as of january 31 2020 we had outstanding letters of credit of 414 million which were issued pursuant to separate agreements

​ 

commercial paper 

​ 

as of january 31 2020 our consolidated balance sheet reflected outstanding unsecured cp notes of 4252 million classified as longterm obligations due to our intent and ability to refinance these obligations as longterm debt an additional 1810 million of outstanding cp notes were held by a whollyowned subsidiary and are therefore not reflected on the consolidated balance sheet under this program we may issue the cp notes from time to time in an aggregate amount not to exceed 10 billion outstanding at any time the cp notes may have maturities of up to 364 days from the date of issue and rank equal in right of payment with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness we intend to maintain available commitments under the revolving facility in an amount at least equal to the amount of cp notes outstanding at any time as of january 31 2020 the consolidated outstanding cp notes had a weighted average borrowing rate of 17 

​ 

senior notes 

​ 

in april 2013 we issued 9000 million aggregate principal amount of 325 senior notes due 2023 the “2023 senior notes” at a discount of 24 million which are scheduled to mature on april 15 2023 in october 2015 we issued 5000 million aggregate principal amount of 4150 senior notes due 2025 the “2025 senior notes” at a discount of 08 million which are scheduled to mature on november 1 2025 in april 2017 we issued 6000 million aggregate principal amount of 3875 senior notes due 2027 the “2027 senior notes” at a discount of 04 million which are scheduled to mature on april 15 2027 in april 2018 we issued 5000 million aggregate principal amount of 4125 senior notes due 2028 the “2028 senior notes” at a discount of 05 million which are scheduled to mature on may 1 2028 collectively the 2023 senior notes 2025 senior notes 2027 senior notes and 2028 senior notes comprise the “senior notes” each of which were issued pursuant to an indenture as supplemented and amended by supplemental indentures relating to each series of senior notes as so 

supplemented and amended the “senior indenture” interest on the 2023 senior notes and the 2027 senior notes is payable in cash on april 15 and october 15 of each year interest on the 2025 and 2028 senior notes is payable in cash on may 1 and november 1 of each year 

​ 

we may redeem some or all of the senior notes at any time at redemption prices set forth in the senior indenture upon the occurrence of a change of control triggering event which is defined in the senior indenture each holder of our senior notes has the right to require us to repurchase some or all of such holder’s senior notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101 of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest if any to but excluding the repurchase date

​ 

the senior indenture contains covenants limiting among other things our ability subject to certain exceptions to consolidate merge or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets and our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur or guarantee indebtedness secured by liens on any shares of voting stock of significant subsidiaries

​ 

the senior indenture also provides for events of default which if any of them occurs would permit or require the principal of and accrued interest on our senior notes to become or to be declared due and payable as applicable

​ 

rating agencies 

​ 

our senior unsecured debt is rated “baa2” by moody’s with a stable outlook and “bbb” by standard  poor’s with a stable outlook and our commercial paper program is rated “p2” by moody’s and “a2” by standard and poor’s our current credit ratings as well as future rating agency actions could i impact our ability to finance our operations on satisfactory terms ii affect our financing costs and iii affect our insurance premiums and collateral requirements necessary for our selfinsured programs there can be no assurance that we will maintain or improve our current credit ratings

​ 

contractual obligations 

​ 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of january 31 2020 in thousands

 ​ 

 ​ 

share repurchase program 

​ 

our existing common stock repurchase program had a total remaining authorization of approximately 11 billion at january 31 2020 under the authorization purchases may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time subject to market and other conditions the authorization has no expiration date and may be modified or terminated from time to time at the discretion of our board of directors for more detail about our share repurchase program see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements

​ 

other considerations 

​ 

on march 11 2020 the board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 036 per share which is payable on or before april 21 2020 to shareholders of record of our common stock on april 7 2020 we paid quarterly cash dividends of 032 per share in 2019 although the board currently expects to continue regular quarterly cash dividends the declaration and amount of future cash dividends are subject to the board’s sole discretion and will depend upon among other factors our results of operations cash requirements financial condition contractual restrictions and other factors that our board may deem relevant in its sole discretion

​ 

our inventory balance represented approximately 55 of our total assets exclusive of goodwill operating lease assets and other intangible assets as of january 31 2020 our ability to effectively manage our inventory balances can have a significant impact on our cash flows from operations during a given fiscal year inventory purchases are often somewhat seasonal in nature such as the purchase of warmweather or christmasrelated merchandise efficient management of our inventory has been and continues to be an area of focus for us

​ 

as described in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements we are involved in a number of legal actions and claims some of which could potentially result in material cash payments adverse developments in those actions could materially and adversely affect our liquidity 

​ 

cash flows 

​ 

cash flows from operating activities cash flows from operating activities were 224 billion in 2019 which represents a 944 million increase compared to 2018 changes in accounts payable resulted in a 4286 million increase in 2019 compared to a 3752 million increase in 2018 due primarily to the timing of receipts and payments which was partially impacted by certain changes in payment terms in addition net income increased by 1231 million in 2019 over 2018 these items were offset by changes in merchandise inventories 

which resulted in a 5788 million decrease in 2019 as compared to a decrease of 5213 million in 2018 changes in income taxes in 2019 compared to 2018 are primarily due to the timing of payments for income taxes

​

​ 

on an ongoing basis we closely monitor and manage our inventory balances and they may fluctuate from period to period based on new store openings the timing of purchases and other factors merchandise inventories increased by 14 in 2019 by 14 in 2018 and by 11 in 2017 inventory levels in the consumables category increased by 3719 million or 14 in 2019 by 3209 million or 14 in 2018 and by 3229 million or 16 in 2017 the seasonal category increased by 1273 million or 17 in 2019 by 1084 million or 17 in 2018 and by 149 million or 2 in 2017 the home products category increased by 828 million or 23 in 2019 by 240 million or 7 in 2018 and by 106 million or 3 in 2017 the apparel category decreased by 21 million or 1 in 2019 and increased by 347 million or 10 in 2018 and by 19 million or 1 in 2017

​ 

significant components of property and equipment purchases in 2018 included the following approximate amounts 289 million for improvements upgrades remodels and relocations of existing stores 242 million for distribution and transportationrelated projects 138 million for new leased stores primarily for leasehold improvements fixtures and equipment and 47 million for information systems upgrades and technologyrelated projects during 2018 we opened 900 new stores and remodeled or relocated 1165 stores

​ 

capital expenditures during 2020 are projected to be in the range of 925 million to 975 million we anticipate funding 2020 capital requirements with a combination of some or all of the following existing cash balances cash flows from operations availability under our revolving facility andor the issuance of additional senior notes or cp notes we plan to continue to invest in store growth and development of approximately 1000 new stores and approximately 1580 stores to be remodeled or relocated capital expenditures in 2020 are anticipated to support our store growth as well as our remodel and relocation initiatives including capital outlays for leasehold improvements fixtures and equipment the construction of new stores costs to support and enhance our supply chain initiatives including new and existing distribution center facilities and our private fleet technology initiatives as well as routine and ongoing capital requirements

​ 

accounting standards 

​ 

in january 2017 the fasb issued amendments to existing guidance related to the subsequent measurement of goodwill these amendments modify the concept of impairment from the condition that exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value to the condition that exists when the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value subsequent to adoption an entity will perform its annual or interim goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value this guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2019 and early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after january 1 2017 the amendments should be applied on a prospective basis an entity is required to disclose the nature of and reason for the change in accounting principle upon transition we do not anticipate a material effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows to result from the adoption of this guidance

​ 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

​ 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “us gaap” requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures in addition to the estimates presented below there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed critical as defined below we believe these estimates are reasonable and appropriate however if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used the resulting changes could have a material effect on the financial statements taken as a whole

​ 

management believes the following policies and estimates are critical because they involve significant judgments assumptions and estimates management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosures presented below relating to those policies and estimates see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of our principal accounting policies

​ 

merchandise inventories  merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market “lcm” with cost determined using the retail last in first out “lifo” method we use the retail inventory method “rim” to calculate gross profit and the resulting valuation of inventories at cost which are computed utilizing a calculated costtoretail inventory ratio at an inventory department level we apply the rim to these departments which are groups of products that are fairly uniform in terms of cost selling price relationship and turnover the 

rim will result in valuing inventories at lcm if permanent markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories inherent in the rim calculation are certain management judgments and estimates that may impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the gross profit recognized these judgments include ensuring departments consist of similar products recording estimated shrinkage between physical inventories and timely recording of markdowns needed to sell inventory 

​ 

we perform an annual lifo analysis whereby all merchandise units are considered for inclusion in the index formulation an actual valuation of inventory under the lifo method is made at the end of each year based on the inventory levels and costs at that time in contrast interim lifo calculations are based on management’s annual estimates of sales the rate of inflation or deflation and yearend inventory levels we also perform analyses for determining obsolete inventory adjusting inventory on a quarterly basis to an lcm value based on various management assumptions including estimated below cost markdowns not yet recorded but required to liquidate such inventory in future periods

​ 

factors considered in the determination of markdowns include current and anticipated demand based on changes in competitors’ practices consumer preferences consumer spending significant weather events and unseasonable weather patterns certain of these factors are outside of our control and may result in greater than estimated markdowns to entice consumer purchases of excess inventory the amount and timing of markdowns may vary significantly from year to year

we perform physical inventories in virtually all of our stores on an annual basis we calculate our shrink provision based on actual physical inventory results during the fiscal period and an accrual for estimated shrink occurring subsequent to a physical inventory through the end of the fiscal reporting period this accrual is calculated as a percentage of sales at each retail store at a department level based on the store’s most recent historical shrink rate to the extent that subsequent physical inventories yield different results than the estimated accrual our effective shrink rate for a given reporting period will include the impact of adjusting to the actual results 

​ 

we believe our estimates and assumptions related to the application of the rim results in a merchandise inventory valuation that reasonably approximates cost on a consistent basis 

​ 

impairment of longlived assets impairment of longlived assets results when the carrying value of the assets exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows generated by the assets our estimate of undiscounted future store cash flows is based upon historical operations of the stores and estimates of future profitability which encompasses many factors that are subject to variability and are difficult to predict if our estimates of future cash flows are not materially accurate our impairment analysis could be impacted accordingly if a longlived asset is found to be impaired the amount recognized for impairment is equal to the difference between the carrying value and the asset’s estimated fair value the fair value is estimated based primarily upon projected future cash flows discounted at our credit adjusted riskfree rate or other reasonable estimates of fair market value although not currently anticipated changes in these estimates assumptions or projections could materially affect the determination of fair value or impairment

​ 

insurance liabilities  we retain a significant portion of the risk for our workers’ compensation employee health general liability property loss automobile and thirdparty landlord claim exposures these represent significant costs primarily due to our large employee base and number of stores provisions are made for these liabilities on an undiscounted basis certain of these liabilities are based on actual claim data and estimates of incurred but not reported claims developed using actuarial methodologies based on historical claim trends which have been and are anticipated to continue to be materially accurate if future claim trends deviate from recent historical patterns or other unanticipated events affect the number and significance of future claims we may be required to record additional expenses or expense reductions which could be material to our future financial results

​ 

contingent liabilities – income taxes income tax reserves are determined using the methodology established by accounting standards relating to uncertainty in income taxes these standards require companies to assess each income tax position taken using a twostep process a determination is first made as to whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained based upon the technical merits upon examination by the taxing authorities if the tax position is expected to meet the more likely than not criteria the benefit recorded for the tax position equals the largest amount that is greater than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement of the respective tax position uncertain tax positions require determinations and liabilities to be estimated based on provisions of the tax law which may be subject to change or varying interpretation if our determinations and estimates prove to be inaccurate the resulting adjustments could be material to our future financial results

​ 

lease accounting  we adopted new accounting guidance related to leases as of february 2 2019 using the modified retrospective approach under this approach existing leases were recorded at the adoption date and comparative periods were not restated and are presented under previously existing guidance adoption of the leasing standard resulted in right of use operating lease assets and operating lease liabilities of approximately 80 billion each as of february 2 2019 significant judgments and estimates were utilized in calculating these initial balances including the determination of appropriate lease discount rates

​ 

many of our stores are subject to buildtosuit arrangements with landlords which typically carry a primary lease term of up to 15 years with multiple renewal options we also have stores subject to shorterterm leases and many of these leases have renewal options certain of our stores have provisions for contingent rentals based upon a percentage of defined sales volume we recognize contingent rental expense when the achievement of specified sales targets is considered probable we record single lease expense on a straightline basis over the lease term including any option periods that are reasonably certain to be renewed commencing on the date that we take physical possession of the property from the landlord which normally includes a period prior to store opening to make necessary leasehold improvements and install store fixtures when a lease contains a predetermined fixed escalation of the minimum rent the related lease expense is recognized on a straightline basis tenant allowances to the extent received are recorded as a reduction of the right of use asset improvements of leased properties are amortized over the shorter of the life of the applicable lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset 

​ 

sharebased payments  our stock option awards are valued on an individual grant basis using the blackscholesmerton closed form option pricing model we believe that this model fairly estimates the value of our stock option awards the application of this valuation model involves assumptions that are judgmental in the valuation of stock options which affects compensation expense related to these options these assumptions include the term that the options are expected to be outstanding the historical volatility of our stock price applicable interest rates and the dividend yield of our stock other factors involving judgments that affect the expensing of sharebased payments include estimated forfeiture rates of sharebased awards historically these estimates have been materially accurate however if our estimates differ materially from actual experience we may be required to record additional expense or reductions of expense which could be material to our future financial results

​ 

fair value measurements accounting standards for the measurement of fair value of assets and liabilities establish a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity observable inputs that are classified within levels 1 and 2 of the hierarchy and the reporting entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions unobservable inputs classified within level 3 of the hierarchy therefore level 3 inputs are typically based on an entity’s own assumptions as there is little if any related market activity and thus require the use of significant judgment and estimates currently we have no assets or liabilities that are valued based solely on level 3 inputs

​ 

our fair value measurements are primarily associated with our outstanding debt instruments we use various valuation models in determining the values of these liabilities we believe that in recent years these methodologies have produced materially accurate valuations

​ 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

​ 

financial risk management 

​ 

we are exposed to market risk primarily from adverse changes in interest rates and to a lesser degree commodity prices to minimize this risk we may periodically use financial instruments including derivatives all derivative financial instrument transactions must be authorized and executed pursuant to approval by the board of directors as a matter of policy we do not buy or sell financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes and any such derivative financial instruments are intended to be used to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure our objective is to correlate derivative financial instruments and the underlying exposure being hedged so that fluctuations in the value of the financial instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying economic exposure

​ 

interest rate risk 

​ 

we manage our interest rate risk through the strategic use of fixed and variable interest rate debt and from time to time derivative financial instruments our principal interest rate exposure relates to outstanding amounts under our revolving facility as well as our commercial paper program as of january 31 2020 we had consolidated borrowings of 4252 million under our commercial paper program and no borrowings outstanding under our revolving facility in order to mitigate a portion of the variable rate interest exposure under the credit facilities in prior years we have entered into various interest rate swaps as of january 31 2020 no such interest rate swaps were outstanding and as a result we are exposed to fluctuations in variable interest rates under the revolving facility and our commercial paper program for a detailed discussion of our revolving facility and our commercial paper program see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements

​ 

a change in interest rates on variable rate debt impacts our pretax earnings and cash flows whereas a change in interest rates on fixed rate debt impacts the economic fair value of debt but not our pretax earnings and cash flows based on our variable rate borrowing levels as of january 31 2020 and february 1 2019 the annualized effect of a one percentage point increase in variable interest rates would have resulted in a pretax reduction of our earnings and cash flows of approximately 43 million in 2019 and 37 million in 2018

​ 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

​ 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that 

controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate

jl turner founded our company in 1939 as jl turner and son wholesale we were incorporated as a kentucky corporation under the name jl turner  son inc in 1955 when we opened our first dollar general store we changed our name to dollar general corporation in 1968 and reincorporated in 1998 as a tennessee corporation our common stock was publicly traded from 1968 until july 2007 when we merged with an entity controlled by investment funds affiliated with kohlberg kravis roberts  co lp or kkr in november 2009 our common stock again became publicly traded and in december 2013 the entity controlled by investment funds affiliated with kkr sold its remaining shares of our common stock 

  

our business model 

  

our long history of profitable growth is founded on a commitment to a relatively simple business model providing a broad base of customers with their basic everyday and household needs supplemented with a variety of general merchandise items at everyday low prices in conveniently located smallbox stores we continually evaluate the needs and demands of our customers and modify our merchandise selections and pricing accordingly while remaining focused on increasing profitability cash generation and returns for our shareholders 

  

our longterm operating priorities remain 1 driving profitable sales growth 2 capturing growth opportunities 3 enhancing our position as a lowcost operator and 4 investing in our people as a competitive advantage for more information on these operating priorities see the “executive overview” section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in part ii item 7 of this report 

  

in 2018 we achieved our 29th consecutive year of positive samestore sales growth we believe that this growth which has taken place in a variety of economic conditions is a result of our compelling value and convenience proposition although no assurances can be given that we will achieve positive samestore sales growth in any given year 

  

compelling value and convenience proposition our ability to deliver highly competitive prices in convenient locations and our easy “in and out” shopping format create a compelling shopping experience that we believe distinguishes us from other discount retailers as well as convenience drug grocery online and mass merchant retailers our slogan “save time save money every day” summarizes our appeal to customers we believe our ability to effectively deliver both value and convenience allows us to succeed in small markets with limited shopping alternatives as well as in larger and more competitive markets our value and convenience proposition is evidenced by the following attributes of our business model 

  



 



  



  



  

substantial growth opportunities we believe we have substantial longterm growth potential in the us we have identified significant opportunities to add new stores in both existing and new markets in addition we have opportunities to relocate or remodel locations within our existing store base to better serve our customers our attractive store economics including a relatively low initial investment and simple lowcost operating model have allowed us to grow our store base to current levels and provide us significant opportunities to continue our profitable store growth strategy 

  

our merchandise 

  

we offer a focused assortment of everyday necessities which we believe helps to drive frequent customer visits and key items in a broad range of general merchandise categories our product assortment provides the opportunity for our customers to address most of their basic shopping needs with one trip we offer a wide selection of nationally advertised brands from leading manufacturers additionally our private brand products offer even greater value with options to purchase products that we believe to be of comparable quality to national brands as well as value items each at substantial discounts to the national brands 

  

consumables is our largest merchandise category and has become a larger percentage of our total sales in recent years as indicated in the table below consumables include paper and cleaning products such as paper towels bath tissue paper dinnerware trash and storage bags laundry and other home cleaning supplies packaged food such as cereals canned soups and vegetables condiments spices sugar and flour perishables such as milk eggs bread refrigerated and frozen food beer and wine snacks such as candy cookies crackers salty snacks and carbonated beverages health and beauty such as overthecounter medicines and personal care products including soap body wash shampoo cosmetics dental hygiene and foot care products pet such as pet supplies and pet food and tobacco products 

  

seasonal products include decorations toys batteries small electronics greeting cards stationery prepaid phones and accessories gardening supplies hardware automotive and home office supplies 

  

home products include kitchen supplies cookware small appliances light bulbs storage containers frames candles craft supplies and kitchen bed and bath soft goods 

  

apparel includes casual everyday apparel for infants toddlers girls boys women and men as well as socks underwear disposable diapers shoes and accessories 

 

  

the percentage of net sales of each of our four categories of merchandise for the fiscal years indicated below was as follows 

  



  

our seasonal and home products categories typically account for the highest gross profit margins and the consumables category typically accounts for the lowest gross profit margin 

  

the dollar general store 

  

the typical dollar general store is operated by a store manager one or more assistant store managers and three or more sales associates our stores generally feature a lowcost no frills building with limited maintenance capital low operating costs and a focused merchandise offering within a broad range of categories allowing us to deliver low retail prices while generating strong cash flows and capital investment returns our stores average approximately 7400 square feet of selling space and approximately 75 of our stores are located in towns of 20000 or fewer people we generally have had good success in locating suitable store sites in the past and we believe that there is ample opportunity for new store growth in existing and new markets in addition we believe we have significant opportunities available for our relocation and remodel programs 

  

our store growth over the past three years is summarized in the following table 

  



  

our customers 

  

our customers seek value and convenience depending on their financial situation and geographic proximity customers’ reliance on dollar general varies from fillin shopping to making periodic trips to stock up on household items to making weekly or more frequent trips to meet most essential needs we generally locate our stores and plan our merchandise selections to best serve the needs of our core customers the low and fixed income households often underserved by other retailers and we are focused on helping them make the most of their spending dollars at the same time however dollar general shoppers from a wide range of income brackets and life stages appreciate our quality merchandise as well as our attractive value and convenience proposition 

  

our suppliers 

  

we purchase merchandise from a wide variety of suppliers and maintain direct buying relationships with many producers of national brand merchandise despite our broad offering we maintain only a limited number of items per category allowing us to keep our average costs low our three largest suppliers each accounted for approximately 8 of our purchases in 2018 our private brands come from a diversified supplier base we directly imported approximately 6 of our purchases at cost in 2018 

  

we have consistently managed to obtain sufficient quantities of core merchandise and believe that if one or more of our current sources of supply became unavailable we generally would be able to obtain alternative 

 

sources however such alternative sources could increase our merchandise costs and supply chain lead time result in a temporary reduction in store inventory levels reduce our selection or reduce the quality of our merchandise and an inability to obtain alternative sources could adversely affect our sales 

  

distribution and transportation 

  

our stores are currently supported by distribution centers for nonrefrigerated merchandise located strategically throughout our geographic footprint we also have a distribution center in amsterdam new york under construction which is expected to be completed in 2019 we lease additional temporary warehouse space as necessary to support our distribution needs we also have purchased a cold storage facility and we are testing the selfdistribution of fresh and frozen products an initiative which we call “dg fresh” we continually analyze and rebalance the network to ensure that it remains efficient and provides the service levels our stores require see “—properties” below for additional information pertaining to our distribution centers 

  

most of our merchandise flows through our distribution centers and is delivered to our stores by thirdparty trucking firms utilizing our trailers we also own approximately 200 semitrailer trucks with which we transport our merchandise in addition vendors or thirdparty distributors deliver or ship certain food items and other merchandise directly to our stores 

  

seasonality 

  

our business is somewhat seasonal generally our most profitable sales mix occurs in the fourth quarter which includes the christmas selling season in addition our quarterly results can be affected by the timing of certain holidays and the timing of new store openings and store closings and the amount of sales contributed by new and existing stores we typically purchase substantial amounts of inventory and incur higher shipping and payroll costs in the third quarter in anticipation of increased sales activity during the fourth quarter see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

  

our competition 

  

we operate in the basic discount consumer goods market which is highly competitive with respect to price customers store location merchandise quality assortment and presentation service offerings instock consistency customer service promotional activity employees and market share we compete with discount stores and many other retailers including mass merchandise warehouse club grocery drug convenience variety online and certain specialty stores these other retail companies operate stores in many of the areas where we operate and many of them engage in extensive advertising and marketing efforts our direct competitors include family dollar dollar tree big lots fred’s 99 cents only and various local independent operators as well as walmart target kroger aldi lidl walgreens cvs and riteaid among others certain of our competitors have greater financial distribution marketing and other resources than we do and may be able to secure better arrangements from suppliers than we can competition has intensified and we believe it will continue to do so as competitors move into or increase their presence in our geographic and product markets and increase the availability of mobile webbased and other digital technology to facilitate a more convenient and competitive customer online and instore shopping experience 

  

we believe that we differentiate ourselves from other forms of retailing by offering consistently low prices in a convenient smallstore format we believe that we are able to maintain competitive prices due in part to our lowcost operating structure and the relatively limited assortment of products offered purchasing large volumes of merchandise within our focused assortment in each merchandise category allows us to keep our average costs low contributing to our ability to offer competitive everyday low prices to our customers see “—our business model” above for further discussion of our competitive situation 

  

 

our employees 

  

as of march 1 2019 we employed approximately 135000 fulltime and parttime employees including divisional and regional managers district managers store managers other store personnel and distribution center and administrative personnel we have increasingly focused on recruiting training motivating and retaining employees and we believe that the quality performance and morale of our employees continue to be an important part of our success in recent years we believe our overall relationship with our employees is good

 item 1a risk factors 

investment in our company involves risks you should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information in this report and other filings that we make from time to time with the sec including our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations or liquidity these risks are not the only risks we face our business financial condition results of operations or liquidity could also be adversely affected by additional factors that apply to all companies generally or by risks not currently known to us or that we currently view to be immaterial we can provide no assurance and make no representation that our risk mitigation efforts although we believe they are reasonable will be successful 

economic factors may reduce our customers’ spending impair our ability to execute our strategies and initiatives and increase our costs and expenses which could result in materially decreased sales or profitability 

many of our customers have fixed or low incomes and limited discretionary spending dollars any factor that could adversely affect their disposable income could decrease our customers’ spending or cause them to shift their spending to our lower margin product choices which could result in materially decreased sales and profitability factors that could reduce our customers’ disposable income include but are not limited to high unemployment or underemployment levels inflation higher fuel energy healthcare and housing costs interest rates consumer debt levels and tax rates tax law changes that negatively affect credits and refunds lack of available credit and decreases in or elimination of government subsidies such as unemployment and food assistance programs 

many of the economic factors listed above as well as commodity rates transportation lease and insurance costs wage rates foreign exchange rate fluctuations measures that create barriers to or increase the costs of international trade including increased import duties or tariffs changes in applicable laws and regulations and other economic factors also could impair our ability to successfully execute our strategies and initiatives as well as increase our cost of goods sold and selling general and administrative expenses including real estate costs and may have other adverse consequences that we are unable to fully anticipate or control all of which may materially decrease our sales or profitability 

our plans depend significantly on strategies and initiatives designed to increase sales and profitability and improve the efficiencies costs and effectiveness of our operations and failure to achieve or sustain these plans could materially affect our results of operations 

we have shortterm and longterm strategies and initiatives such as those relating to merchandising real estate and new store development store formats digital shrink sourcing private brand inventory management supply chain store operations expense reduction and technology in various stages of testing evaluation and implementation which are designed to continue to improve our results of operations and financial condition the effectiveness of these initiatives is inherently uncertain even when tested successfully and is dependent on consistency of training and execution workforce stability ease of execution and the absence of offsetting factors that can influence results adversely many of these factors are made even more challenging by the diverse geographic locations of our stores and distribution centers and our decentralized field management other risk factors described herein also could negatively affect general implementation failure to achieve successful or costeffective implementation of our initiatives could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the success of our merchandising initiatives particularly our nonconsumable initiatives and efforts to increase sales of higher margin products within the consumables category further depends in part upon our ability to predict the products that our customers will demand and to identify and timely respond to evolving trends in demographic mixes in our markets and consumer preferences if we are unable to select and timely obtain 

 

products that are attractive to customers and at costs that allow us to sell them at an acceptable profit or to effectively market such products it could result in materially decreased sales and profitability 

we are currently testing a cold chain selfdistribution initiative which we refer to as our dg fresh initiative and also testing an initiative we refer to as fast track which is designed to enhance our instore labor productivity onshelf availability and customer convenience the success of our dg fresh initiative further depends in part on our ability to effectively transition these distribution operations from our current service providers without business disruption as well as on the availability of certain supply chain resources including temperaturecontrolled distribution centers refrigerated transportation equipment and drivers the success of our fast track initiative further depends in part on vendor cooperation successful implementation and maintenance of the necessary technology customer interest and adoption and our ability to gain cost efficiencies and control shrink levels from the initiative 

if we cannot timely and costeffectively execute our real estate projects and meet our financial expectations or if we do not anticipate or successfully address all of the challenges imposed by our expansion including into new states or metro areas it could materially impede our planned future growth and our profitability 

delays in or failure to complete any of our real estate projects or failure to meet our financial expectations for these projects could materially adversely affect our growth and our profitability our ability to timely open relocate and remodel profitable stores and expand into additional market areas is a key component of our planned future growth and may depend in part on the availability of suitable store locations and capital funding the absence of entitlement process or occupancy delays the ability to negotiate acceptable lease and development terms to costeffectively hire and train new personnel especially store managers and to identify and accurately assess sufficient customer demand and general economic conditions 

we also may not anticipate or successfully address all of the challenges imposed by the expansion of our operations including into new states or metro areas where we have limited or no meaningful experience or brand recognition those areas may have different competitive and market conditions consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns than our existing markets as well as higher cost of entry and operating costs these factors may cause our new stores to be less profitable than stores in our existing markets which could slow future growth in these areas in addition many new stores will be located in areas where we have existing stores which may result in inadvertent oversaturation and temporarily or permanently divert customers and sales from our existing stores thereby adversely affecting our overall financial performance 

we face intense competition that could limit our growth opportunities and materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

the retail business is highly competitive with respect to price customers store location merchandise quality product assortment and presentation service offerings instock consistency customer service promotional activity employees and market share we compete with discount stores and many other retailers including mass merchandise warehouse club grocery drug convenience variety online retailers and certain specialty stores to maintain our competitive position we may be required to lower prices either temporarily or permanently and may have limited ability to increase prices in response to increased costs resulting in lower margins and reduced profitability certain of our competitors have greater financial distribution marketing and other resources and may be able to secure better arrangements with suppliers than we 

competition has intensified and is expected to continue to do so as competitors enter or increase their presence in our geographic and product markets and expand availability of mobile webbased and other digital technologies we remain vulnerable to the risk that our competitors or others could enter our industry in a significant way including through the introduction of new store formats further consolidation or other business combinations or alliances within the retail industry could significantly alter the competitive dynamics of the retail 

 

marketplace and result in competitors with greatly improved competitive positions as well as competitors providing a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices which could materially affect our financial performance our ability to effectively compete will depend substantially upon our continued ability to develop and execute compelling and costeffective strategies and initiatives if we fail to respond effectively to competitive pressures and industry changes it could materially affect our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

inventory shrinkage may negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we experience significant inventory shrinkage although some level of inventory shrinkage is an unavoidable cost of doing business if we were to experience higher rates of inventory shrinkage or incur increased security or other costs to combat inventory theft our results of operations and financial condition could be affected adversely there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to reduce inventory shrinkage 

our cash flows from operations profitability and financial condition may be negatively affected if we are not successful in managing our inventory balances 

our inventory balance represented approximately 53 of our total assets exclusive of goodwill and other intangible assets as of february 1 2019 efficient inventory management is a key component of our business success and profitability we must maintain sufficient inventory levels and an appropriate product mix to meet our customers’ demands without allowing those levels to increase to such an extent that the costs to store and hold the goods unduly impacts our financial results or that increases the risk of inventory shrinkage if we do not accurately predict customer trends or spending levels or if we inappropriately price products we may have to take unanticipated markdowns to dispose of the excess inventory which also can adversely affect our financial results we continue to focus on ways to reduce these risks but we cannot make assurances that we will be successful in our inventory management if we are not successful in managing our inventory balances our cash flows from operations and financial condition may be negatively affected 

failure to maintain the security of our business customer employee or vendor information could expose us to litigation government enforcement actions and costly response measures and could materially harm our reputation and affect our business and financial performance 

in connection with sales we transmit confidential credit and debit card information which is encrypted using pointtopoint encryption we also have access to collect or maintain certain private or confidential information regarding our customers employees and their dependents and vendors as well as our business some of this information is stored electronically in connection with our ecommerce and mobile applications some of which may leverage thirdparty service providers additionally we may share information with select vendors that assist us in conducting our business while we have implemented procedures and technology intended to protect such information and require appropriate controls of our service providers cyberattackers could compromise such controls and obtain such information as cyberattacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated and do not always immediately produce signs of intrusion moreover employee error or malfeasance or other irregularities could result in a defeat of security measures and compromise our or our thirdparty vendors’ information systems if cyberattackers obtain customer employee or partner passwords through unrelated thirdparty breaches these passwords could be used to gain access to their information or accounts with us 

because we accept debit and credit cards for payment we are subject to industry data protection standards and protocols such as the payment card industry data security standards issued by the payment card industry security standards council nonetheless we may be vulnerable to and unable to detect and appropriately respond to data security breaches and data loss including cybersecurity attacks or other breaches of cardholder data 

 

a significant security breach of any kind experienced by us or one of our vendors which could be undetected for a period of time or a significant failure by us to comply with applicable privacy and information security laws regulations and standards could expose us to risks of data loss litigation government enforcement actions fines or penalties credit card brand assessments negative publicity and reputational harm business disruption and costly response measures for example providing notification to and credit monitoring services for affected individuals as well as further upgrades to our security measures which may not be covered by or may exceed the coverage limits of our insurance policies and could materially disrupt our operations any resulting negative publicity could significantly harm our reputation which could cause us to lose market share as a result of customers discontinuing the use of our ecommerce and mobile applications or debit or credit cards in our stores or not shopping in our stores altogether and could materially adversely affect our business and financial performance 

a significant disruption to our distribution network the capacity of our distribution centers or the timely receipt of inventory could adversely affect sales or increase our transportation costs which would decrease our profitability 

we rely on our distribution and transportation network to provide goods to our stores timely and cost‑effectively using various transportation modes including ocean rail and truck we and our vendors move goods from vendor locations to our distribution centers and our stores any disruption unanticipated or unusual expense or operational failure related to this process for example delivery delays or increases in transportation costs including increased fuel costs carrier or driver wages as a result of driver shortages a decrease in transportation capacity for overseas shipments labor shortages or work stoppages for slowdowns could negatively impact sales and profits labor shortages or work stoppages in the transportation industry or disruptions to the national and international transportation infrastructure that lead to delivery delays or that necessitate our securing alternative labor or shipping suppliers could also increase our costs or otherwise negatively affect our business 

we maintain a network of distribution facilities and are moving forward with plans to build or lease new facilities to support our growth objectives and strategic initiatives delays in opening such facilities could adversely affect our financial performance by slowing store growth which may in turn reduce revenue growth or by increasing transportation costs in addition distributionrelated construction or expansion projects entail risks that could cause delays and cost overruns such as shortages of materials or skilled labor work stoppages unforeseen construction scheduling engineering environmental or geological problems weather interference fires or other casualty losses and unanticipated cost increases for these reasons the completion date and ultimate cost of these projects could differ significantly from initial expectations and we cannot guarantee that any project will be completed on time or within established budgets 

risks associated with or faced by our suppliers could adversely affect our financial performance 

we source our merchandise from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers and we depend on them to supply merchandise in a timely and efficient manner in 2018 our three largest suppliers each accounted for approximately 8 of our purchases if one or more of our current sources of supply became unavailable we believe we would generally be able to obtain alternative sources but it could increase our merchandise costs and supply chain lead time result in a temporary reduction in store inventory levels and reduce the quality of our merchandise an inability to obtain alternative sources could materially decrease our sales additionally if a supplier fails to deliver on its commitments we could experience merchandise out‑of‑stocks that could lead to lost sales and reputational harm further failure of suppliers to meet our compliance protocols could prolong our procurement lead time resulting in lost sales and adverse margin impact 

we directly imported approximately 6 of our purchases measured at cost in 2018 but many of our domestic vendors directly import their products or components of their products changes to the prices and flow of these goods for any reason such as political unrest acts of war currency fluctuations disruptions in maritime lanes port labor disputes and economic conditions and instability in countries in which foreign suppliers are 

 

located the financial instability of suppliers failure to meet our standards issues with our suppliers’ labor practices or labor problems they may experience such as strikes stoppages or slowdowns which could also increase labor costs during and following the disruption the availability and cost of raw materials to suppliers increased import duties merchandise quality or safety issues transport availability and cost increases in wage rates and taxes transport security inflation and other factors relating to suppliers and the countries in which they are located or from which they import often are beyond our control and could adversely affect our operations and profitability while we are working to diversify our sources of imported goods a substantial amount of our imported merchandise comes from china and thus a change in the chinese leadership economic and market conditions internal economic stimulus actions or currency or other policies as well as trade relations between china and the united states and increases in costs of labor and wage taxes could negatively impact our merchandise costs in addition the united states’ foreign trade policies duties tariffs and other impositions on imported goods trade sanctions imposed on certain countries particularly china import limitations on certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade and port labor agreements are beyond our control these and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our business and financial performance if we increase our product imports from foreign vendors the risks associated with these imports also will increase and we may be exposed to additional or different risks as we increase imports of goods produced in countries other than china 

product liability product recall or other product safety or labeling claims could adversely affect our business reputation and financial performance 

we are dependent on our vendors to ensure that the products we buy from them comply with applicable product safety and labeling laws and regulations and to inform us of all applicable restrictions on the sale of such products nonetheless product liability personal injury or other claims may be asserted against us relating to product contamination tampering expiration mislabeling recall and other safety or labeling issues including those relating to products that we may selfdistribute through our dg fresh initiative 

we seek but may not be successful in obtaining contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from our vendors if we do not have adequate contractual indemnification or insurance available such claims could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations our ability to obtain indemnification from foreign vendors may be hindered by our ability to obtain jurisdiction over them to enforce contractual obligations even with adequate insurance and indemnification such claims could significantly harm our reputation and consumer confidence in our products and we could incur significant litigation expenses which also could materially affect our results of operations even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or not fully pursued 

a significant change in governmental regulations and requirements could materially increase our cost of doing business and noncompliance with governmental regulations could materially adversely affect our financial performance 

we routinely incur significant costs in complying with numerous and frequently changing laws and regulations the complexity of this regulatory environment and related compliance costs are increasing due to additional legal and regulatory requirements our expanding operations and increased enforcement efforts new or revised laws regulations policies and related interpretations and enforcement practices particularly those dealing with environmental compliance product and food safety or labeling information security and privacy labor and employment employee wages and those governing the sale of products may significantly increase our expenses or require extensive system and operating changes that could materially increase our cost of doing business violations of applicable laws and regulations or untimely or incomplete execution of a required product recall can result in significant penalties including loss of licenses eligibility to accept certain government benefits such as snap or significant fines class action or other litigation and reputational damage additionally changes in tax laws the interpretation of existing laws or our failure to sustain our reporting positions on examination could adversely affect our overall effective tax rate 

 

litigation may adversely affect our reputation business results of operations and financial condition 

our business is subject to the risk of litigation by employees consumers suppliers competitors shareholders government agencies and others through private actions class actions multidistrict litigation administrative proceedings regulatory actions or other litigation the outcome of litigation particularly class action or multidistrict litigation and regulatory actions is difficult to assess or quantify plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts and the magnitude of the potential loss may remain unknown for lengthy periods of time in addition certain of these lawsuits if decided adversely to us or settled by us may result in liability material to our financial statements as a whole or may negatively affect our operating results if changes to our business operations are required the cost to defend litigation may be significant and adverse publicity could harm our reputation regardless of the validity of the allegations as a result litigation may adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition see also note 6 to the consolidated financial statements 

our current insurance program may expose us to unexpected costs and negatively affect our financial performance 

our insurance coverage reflects deductibles selfinsured retentions limits of liability and similar provisions that we believe are prudent based on our operations however there are types of losses we may incur but against which we cannot be insured or which we believe are not economically reasonable to insure such as losses due to acts of war certain crimes including employee crime certain wage and hour and other employmentrelated claims and litigation actions based on certain consumer protection laws and some natural and other disasters or similar events if we incur material uninsured losses our financial performance could suffer certain material events may result in sizable losses for the insurance industry and adversely affect the availability of adequate insurance coverage or result in excessive premium increases to offset negative insurance market trends we may elect to selfinsure accept higher deductibles or reduce the amount of coverage in addition we selfinsure a significant portion of expected losses under our workers’ compensation automobile liability general liability including claims made against certain of our landlords and group health insurance programs significant changes in actuarial assumptions and management estimates underlying our recorded liabilities for these losses including expected increases in medical and indemnity costs could result in materially different expenses than expected under these programs which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition although we maintain property insurance for catastrophic events at our store support center and distribution centers we are effectively selfinsured for other property losses if we experience a greater number of these losses than we anticipate our financial performance could be adversely affected 

natural disasters and unusual weather conditions whether or not caused by climate change pandemic outbreaks terrorist acts and global political events could disrupt business and result in lower sales and otherwise adversely affect our financial performance 

the occurrence of one or more natural disasters such as hurricanes fires floods tornadoes and earthquakes unusual weather conditions pandemic outbreaks terrorist acts or disruptive global political events such as civil unrest in countries in which our suppliers are located or similar disruptions could adversely affect our business and financial performance unseasonal or significant weather conditions can affect consumer shopping patterns or prevent customers from reaching our stores which could lead to lost sales or higher markdowns if these events result in the closure of one or more of our distribution centers a significant number of stores or our corporate headquarters or impact one or more of our key suppliers our operations and financial performance could be materially adversely affected through an inability to make deliveries or provide other support functions to our stores and through lost sales these events also could result in increases in fuel or other energy prices a fuel shortage store opening delays the temporary lack of an adequate work force in a market the temporary or longterm disruption of product availability in our stores and disruption of our utility services or information systems these events may also increase the costs of insurance if they result in significant loss of property or other insurable damage 

 

material damage or interruptions to our information systems as a result of external factors staffing shortages or challenges in maintaining or updating our existing technology or developing or implementing new technology could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we depend on a variety of information technology systems including systems owned and managed by thirdparty vendors for the efficient functioning of our business including without limitation transaction processing and the management of our employees facilities logistics inventories stores and customerfacing digital applications and operations our technology initiatives may not deliver desired results or may do so on a delayed schedule additionally such systems are subject to damage or interruption from power surges and outages facility damage computer and telecommunications failures malicious code including computer viruses worms ransomware or similar cyberattacks including account compromise phishing denial of service attacks and application network or system vulnerability exploitation software upgrade failures or code defects natural disasters and human error design defects or damage or interruption to these systems may require a significant investment to fix or replace disrupt our operations result in the loss or corruption of critical data and harm our reputation all of which could materially adversely affect our business or results of operations 

we also rely heavily on our information technology staff failure to meet these staffing needs may negatively affect our ability to fulfill our technology initiatives while continuing to provide maintenance on existing systems we rely on third parties to maintain and periodically upgrade many of these systems so that they can continue to support our business we license the software programs supporting many of our systems from independent software developers the inability of these vendors developers or us to continue to maintain and upgrade these systems and software programs could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations if we were unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner and could expose us to greater risk of a cyberattack in addition costs and delays associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology or with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems could also disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations and adversely affect our profitability 

failure to attract train and retain qualified employees while controlling labor costs as well as other labor issues could adversely affect our financial performance 

our future growth and performance positive customer experience and legal and regulatory compliance depends on our ability to attract train retain and motivate qualified employees many of whom are in positions with historically high rates of turnover our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling our labor costs is subject to many external factors including competition for and availability of qualified personnel unemployment levels wage rates minimum wage laws health and other insurance costs changes in employment and labor laws or other workplace regulations including changes in employee benefit programs such as health insurance and paid leave programs employee activism and our reputation and relevance within the labor market if we are unable to attract train and retain adequate numbers of qualified employees our operations customer service levels legal and regulatory compliance and support functions could suffer in addition to the extent a significant portion of our employee base unionizes or attempts to unionize our labor costs could increase our ability to pass along labor costs to our customers is constrained by our everyday low price model and we may not be able to offset such increased costs elsewhere in our business 

our success depends on our executive officers and other key personnel if we lose key personnel or are unable to hire additional qualified personnel our business may be harmed 

our future success depends to a significant degree on the skills experience and efforts of our executive officers and other key personnel the unexpected loss of the services of any of such persons could adversely affect our operations there can be no assurance that our executive succession planning retention or hiring efforts will be successful competition for skilled and experienced management personnel is intense and our future success will also depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and a failure to attract and retain new qualified personnel could adversely affect our operations 

 

our private brands may not be successful in improving our gross profit rate and may increase certain of the risks we face 

the sale of private brand items is an important component of our sales growth and gross profit rate enhancement plans broad market acceptance of our private brands depends on many factors including pricing quality customer perception and timely development and introduction of new products we cannot give assurance that we will achieve or maintain our expected level of private brand sales the sale and expansion of these offerings also subjects us to or increases certain risks such as product liability claims and product recalls disruptions in raw material and finished product supply and distribution chains inability to successfully protect our proprietary rights claims related to the proprietary rights of third parties and other risks generally encountered by entities that source sell and market exclusive branded offerings for retail failure to appropriately address these risks could materially adversely affect our private brand initiatives reputation results of operations and financial condition 

because our business is somewhat seasonal adverse events during the fourth quarter could materially affect our financial statements as a whole 

primarily because of sales of christmasrelated merchandise our most profitable sales mix generally occurs in the fourth quarter in anticipation of this holiday we purchase substantial amounts of seasonal inventory and if sales fall below seasonal norms or expectations it could result in unanticipated markdowns adverse events such as deteriorating economic conditions high unemployment rates high gas prices public transportation disruptions or unusual or unanticipated adverse weather could result in lowerthanplanned sales during the christmas selling season which in turn could reduce our profitability and otherwise adversely affect our financial performance and operating results 

deterioration in market conditions or changes in our credit profile could adversely affect our business operations and financial condition 

we rely on the positive cash flow we generate from our operating activities and our access to the credit and capital markets to fund our operations growth strategy and return of cash to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends changes in the credit and capital markets including market disruptions limited liquidity and interest rate fluctuations may increase the cost of financing or restrict our access to these potential sources of future liquidity our continued access to liquidity sources on favorable terms depends on multiple factors including our operating performance and credit ratings our debt securities currently are rated investment grade and a downgrade of this rating likely would negatively impact our access to the debt capital markets and increase our cost of borrowing as a result disruptions in the debt markets or any downgrade of our credit ratings could adversely affect our business operations and financial condition and our ability to return cash to our shareholders we can make no assurances that our ability to obtain additional financing through the debt markets will not be adversely affected by economic conditions or that we will be able to maintain or improve our current credit ratings 

new accounting guidance or changes in the interpretation or application of existing accounting guidance could adversely affect our financial performance 

the implementation of new accounting standards could require certain systems internal process and controls and other changes that could increase our operating costs and will result in changes to our financial statements for example the implementation of accounting standards related to leases as issued by the financial accounting standards board required us to make significant changes to our lease management and other accounting systems and will result in a material impact to our consolidated financial statements 

us generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business involve 

 

many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by our management changes in these rules or their interpretation or in underlying management assumptions estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance the outcome of such changes could include litigation or regulatory actions which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

executive overview 

  

we are among the largest discount retailers in the united states by number of stores with 15472 stores located in 44 states as of march 1 2019 with the greatest concentration of stores in the southern southwestern midwestern and eastern united states we offer a broad selection of merchandise including consumable products such as food paper and cleaning products health and beauty products and pet supplies and nonconsumable products such as seasonal merchandise home decor and domestics and basic apparel our merchandise includes national brands from leading manufacturers as well as our own private brand selections with prices at substantial discounts to national brands we offer our customers these national brand and private brand products at everyday low prices typically 10 or less in our convenient smallbox locations 

  

we believe our convenient store formats locations and broad selection of highquality products at compelling values have driven our substantial growth and financial success over the years and through a variety of economic cycles we are mindful that the majority of our customers are valueconscious and many have low andor fixed incomes as a result we are intensely focused on helping our customers make the most of their spending dollars our core customers are often among the first to be affected by negative or uncertain economic conditions and among the last to feel the effects of improving economic conditions particularly when trends are inconsistent and of an uncertain duration the primary macroeconomic factors that affect our core customers include the unemployment and underemployment rates wage growth fuel prices changes in us and global trade policy including price increases from tariffs and changes to certain government assistance programs such as the supplemental nutrition assistance program additionally our customers are impacted by increases in those expenses that generally comprise a large portion of their household budget such as rent and healthcare finally significant unseasonable or unusual weather patterns can impact customer shopping behaviors 

  

we remain committed to the following longterm operating priorities as we consistently strive to improve our performance while retaining our customercentric focus 1 driving profitable sales growth 2 capturing growth opportunities 3 enhancing our position as a lowcost operator and 4 investing in our people as a competitive advantage 

  

we seek to drive profitable sales growth through initiatives aimed at increasing customer traffic and average transaction amount as we work to provide everyday low prices and meet our customers’ affordability needs we remain focused on enhancing our margins through effective category management inventory shrink reduction initiatives private brands penetration distribution and transportation efficiencies including a test to selfdistribute fresh and frozen products which we call “dg fresh” global sourcing and pricing and markdown optimization several of our salesdriving initiatives are also designed to capture growth opportunities and are discussed in more detail below 

  

historically our sales of consumables which tend to have lower gross margins have been the key drivers of net sales and customer traffic while sales of nonconsumables which tend to have higher gross margins have contributed to more profitable sales growth and an increase in average transaction amount throughout 2018 our sales mix continued to shift slightly toward consumables and within consumables slightly toward lower margin departments such as perishables and tobacco while we expect some sales mix challenges to persist certain of our initiatives are intended to address these trends although there can be no assurance we will be successful in reversing them 

  

 

we continue to make progress on and invest in certain strategic initiatives that we believe will help drive profitable sales growth and capture longterm growth opportunities such opportunities include leveraging existing and developing new digital tools and technology to provide our customers with additional shopping access points and even greater convenience following an indepth analysis in 2018 we began testing a refreshed approach to our nonconsumable product offerings this nonconsumables initiative is a merchandising strategy that offers a new differentiated and limited assortment that will change throughout the year as we look to roll out this initiative more broadly in 2019 our goal for this initiative is to continue to improve the shopping experience while delivering exceptional value within key areas of our nonconsumable categories in 2019 we also are testing two initiatives aimed at driving sales and enhancing our position as a lowcost operator as discussed further below 

  

tariffs currently in effect on products from china as applied to both our direct imports and domestic purchases did not have a material impact on our financial results in fiscal 2018 the recently postponed increase in tariff rates applicable to products from china if ultimately implemented as well as any other future increase in tariff rates or the expansion of products subject to tariffs may have a more significant impact on our business and on our customers’ budgets we continue to work to minimize price increases to our customers and to mitigate the potential sales and margin impact of current and potential future tariffs through various merchandising efforts there can be no assurance we will be successful in our efforts to mitigate these impacts in whole or in part 

  

to support our other operating priorities we remain focused on capturing growth opportunities in 2018 we opened 900 new stores remodeled 1050 stores and relocated 115 stores for 2019 we plan to open approximately 975 new stores remodel approximately 1000 stores and relocate approximately 100 stores for an approximate total of 2075 real estate projects 

  

we continue to innovate within our channel and are able to utilize the most productive of our various store formats based on the specific market opportunity we expect that our traditional 7300 square foot store format will continue to be the primary store layout for new stores relocations and remodels in 2019 we expect approximately 500 of the planned 1000 remodels in 2019 to use the highercoolercount store format that enables us to offer an increased selection of perishable items in addition our smaller format store less than 6000 square feet allows us to capture growth opportunities in metropolitan areas as well as in rural areas with a low number of households we continue to incorporate lessons learned from our various store formats and layouts into our existing store base with a goal of driving increased customer traffic average transaction amount samestore sales and overall store productivity 

  

to support our new store growth and drive productivity we continue to make investments in our traditional distribution center network for nonrefrigerated merchandise most recently we began shipping from our distribution center in longview texas in january 2019 in addition our distribution center in amsterdam new york is currently under construction and we expect to begin shipping from this facility later in 2019 

  

we have established a position as a lowcost operator always seeking ways to reduce or control costs that do not affect our customers’ shopping experiences we plan to continue enhancing this position over time while employing ongoing cost discipline to reduce certain expenses as a percentage of sales nonetheless we seek to maintain flexibility to invest in the business as necessary to enhance our longterm profitability 

  

in 2019 we will be testing “dg fresh” a selfdistribution model for fresh and frozen products that is designed to enhance sales reduce product costs improve our instock position and enhance item assortment and fast track an initiative aimed at further enhancing our convenience proposition and instock position as well as increasing labor productivity within our stores these and certain other strategic initiatives will require us to incur upfront expenses for which there may not be an immediate return in terms of sales or enhanced profitability 

  

certain operating expenses such as wage rates and occupancy costs have continued to increase in recent years while we expect these increases to persist certain of our initiatives and plans are intended to help offset these challenges although there can be no assurance we will be successful in mitigating them 

 

  

our employees are a competitive advantage and we proactively seek ways to continue investing in them our goal is to create an environment that attracts and retains talented personnel particularly at the store level because employees who are promoted from within our company generally have longer tenures and are greater contributors to improvements in our financial performance we believe our investments in compensation and training for our store managers have contributed to improved customer experience scores higher sales and improved turnover metrics 

  

to further enhance shareholder return we repurchased shares of our common stock and paid quarterly cash dividends throughout 2018 in 2019 we intend to continue our share repurchase activity and to pay quarterly cash dividends subject to board discretion and approval 

  

a continued focus on our four operating priorities as discussed above coupled with strong cash flow management and share repurchases resulted in solid overall operating and financial performance in 2018 as compared to 2017 as set forth below basis points as referred to below are equal to 001 as a percentage of net sales 

  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  

readers should refer to the detailed discussion of our operating results below for additional comments on financial performance in the current year as compared with the prior years presented 

  

 

results of operations 

  

accounting periods the following text contains references to years 2018 2017 and 2016 which represent fiscal years ended february 1 2019 february 2 2018 and february 3 2017 respectively our fiscal year ends on the friday closest to january 31 fiscal years 2018 and 2017 were 52week accounting periods and fiscal year 2016 was a 53week accounting period 

  

seasonality  the nature of our business is somewhat seasonal primarily because of sales of christmasrelated merchandise operating profit in our fourth quarter november december and january has historically been higher than operating profit achieved in each of the first three quarters of the fiscal year expenses and to a greater extent operating profit vary by quarter results of a period shorter than a full year may not be indicative of results expected for the entire year furthermore the seasonal nature of our business may affect comparisons between periods 

  

the following table contains results of operations data for fiscal years 2018 2017 and 2016 and the dollar and percentage variances among those years 

  



  

net sales  the net sales increase in 2018 reflects a samestore sales increase of 32 compared to 2017 samestores include stores that have been open for at least 13 months and remain open at the end of the reporting period changes in samestore sales are calculated based on the comparable calendar weeks in the prior year and include stores that have been remodeled expanded or relocated in 2018 our 14283 samestores accounted for sales of 239 billion the increase in samestore sales primarily reflects an increase in average transaction amount 

 

relative to 2017 the increase in average transaction amount was driven by higher average item retail prices and to a lesser extent an increase in average items per transaction while customer traffic was essentially unchanged samestore sales in 2018 increased in the consumables seasonal and home products categories and declined in the apparel category compared to 2017 samestore sales results in 2018 for the three nonconsumables categories when aggregated were positive the 2018 net sales increase was positively affected by new stores modestly offset by sales from closed stores 

  

the net sales increase in 2017 reflects a samestore sales increase of 27 compared to 2016 in 2017 our 13150 samestores accounted for sales of 219 billion the increase in samestore sales was due to increases in average transaction amount and customer traffic relative to 2016 samestore sales in 2017 increased in the consumables and seasonal categories and declined in the home products and apparel categories compared to 2016 samestore sales results in 2017 for the three nonconsumables categories when aggregated were positive net sales for the 53 rd week of 2016 totaled 3987 million the 2017 net sales increase was positively affected by new stores modestly offset by sales from closed stores 

  

of our four major merchandise categories the consumables category which generally has a lower gross profit rate than the other three categories has grown most significantly over the past several years because of the impact of sales mix on gross profit we continually review our merchandise mix and strive to adjust it when appropriate 

  

gross profit for 2018 gross profit increased by 81 and as a percentage of net sales decreased by 32 basis points to 305 compared to 2017 higher markdowns a greater proportion of sales of consumables which generally have a lower gross profit rate than our other product categories and sales of lower margin products comprising a higher proportion of consumables sales as well as increases in transportation costs and an increased lifo provision reduced the gross profit rate these factors were partially offset by an improved rate of inventory shrinkage and higher initial markups on inventory purchases 

  

for 2017 gross profit increased by 65 and as a percentage of net sales decreased by 8 basis points to 308 compared to 2016 a greater proportion of sales of consumables which generally have a lower gross profit rate than our other product categories and sales of lower margin products comprising a higher proportion of consumables sales reduced the gross profit rate higher markdowns which were primarily for promotional activities and increases in transportation costs also reduced the gross profit rate and these factors were partially offset by higher initial markups on inventory purchases and an improved rate of inventory shrinkage 

  

sga sga as a percentage of sales decreased by 1 basis point rounding to 222 in both 2018 and 2017 the 2018 amounts reflect a reduction in repairs and maintenance expenses which were offset by occupancy costs and depreciation expenses each of which increased at a rate greater than the increase in net sales the 2018 amounts reflect an increase in hurricane and other disasterrelated expenses of approximately 143 million compared to 2017 the 2017 amounts include costs of 240 million related to the closure of 35 underperforming stores primarily expenses for remaining lease liabilities 

  

sga as a percentage of sales was 222 in 2017 compared to 215 in 2016 an increase of 75 basis points the 2017 amounts reflect increased retail labor expenses which includes our investment in store manager compensation increased occupancy costs and higher incentive compensation each of which increased at a rate greater than the increase in net sales partially offsetting these increased expenses were reduced advertising costs and costs that increased at a rate less than the increase in net sales including utilities and waste management costs primarily resulting from our recycling efforts the 2017 amounts include costs related to the closure of 35 underperforming stores discussed above the 2017 amounts also reflect an increase in hurricane and other disasterrelated expenses of approximately 180 million compared to 2016 sga as a percentage of sales was favorably impacted in 2016 by increased sales including the 53 rd week discussed above among other factors 

  

interest expense  interest expense increased 28 million to 999 million in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to higher average interest rates which was partially offset by a decrease in average debt outstanding 

 

interest expense decreased 08 million to 970 million in 2017 compared to 2016 see the detailed discussion under “liquidity and capital resources” regarding the financing of various longterm obligations 

  

we had consolidated outstanding variablerate debt of 3733 million and 6125 million as of february 1 2019 and february 2 2018 respectively and the remainder of our outstanding indebtedness as of each of those dates was fixed rate debt 

  

other income expense  other income expense in 2018 reflects expenses associated with the voluntary prepayment of our senior unsecured term loan facility and in 2017 reflects expenses associated with the issuance and refinancing of longterm debt 

  

income taxes  the effective income tax rates for 2018 2017 and 2016 were expenses of 211 193 and 363 respectively 

  

under accounting standards for income taxes the impact of new tax legislation must be taken into account in the period in which the new legislation is enacted including the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities at the tax rates at which such items are expected to reverse in future periods subsequent to the signing of the tax cuts and jobs act the “act” the securities and exchange commission staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 “sab 118” which allows companies to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year after the enactment date while the accounting impact is still under analysis our 2017 provision for income taxes reflected such estimates due to the changes in income tax law including a provisional tax benefit of 335 million the provisional tax benefit consisted of 3108 million related to the onetime remeasurement of the federal portion of our deferred tax assets and liabilities at the 21 rate and 242 million related to the reduced statutory tax rate of 337 compared to 35 in prior years we concluded our analysis of the accounting impact of the act pursuant to sab 118 and recorded immaterial adjustments related to our 2017 provision for income taxes in 2018 

  

the effective income tax rate for 2018 was 211 compared to a rate of 193 for 2017 which represents a net increase of 18 percentage points the effective income tax rate was higher in 2018 primarily due to the onetime remeasurement of the deferred tax assets and liabilities at 21 in 2017 which was offset by the reduction in the current federal tax rate from 337 in 2017 to 21 in 2018 

  

the effective income tax rate for 2017 was 193 compared to a rate of 363 for 2016 which represents a net decrease of 170 percentage points the effective income tax rate was lower in 2017 primarily due to the onetime remeasurement of the federal portions of our deferred tax assets and liabilities at 21 accompanied by the changes in the federal income tax laws pursuant to the act that lowered our statutory federal tax rate to 337 for the 2017 fiscal year compared to 35 in 2016 

  

off balance sheet arrangements 

  

we are not party to any material off balance sheet arrangements 

  

effects of inflation 

  

in 2018 we experienced increases in certain product costs due in part to tariffs on certain items imported from china we experienced minimal overall commodity cost inflation or deflation in 2017 in 2016 we experienced product cost deflation reflecting reductions in commodity costs primarily related to food products 

  

 

liquidity and capital resources 

  

current financial condition and recent developments 

  

during the past three years we have generated an aggregate of approximately 56 billion in cash flows from operating activities and incurred approximately 19 billion in capital expenditures during that period we expanded the number of stores we operate by 2887 representing growth of approximately 23 and we remodeled or relocated 2835 stores or approximately 23 of the stores we operated as of the beginning of the period in 2019 we intend to continue our current strategy of pursuing store growth remodels and relocations 

  

at february 1 2019 we had a 125 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement the “revolving facility” 25 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes and a commercial paper program that may provide borrowing availability of up to 10 billion at february 1 2019 we had total consolidated outstanding debt including the current portion of longterm obligations of 29 billion which includes commercial paper borrowings “cp notes” and senior notes all of which are described in greater detail below our borrowing availability under the revolving facility may be effectively limited by our cp notes as further described below the information contained in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii item 8 of this report is incorporated herein by reference 

  

we believe our cash flow from operations and our existing cash balances combined with availability under the revolving facility cp notes and access to the debt markets will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our current obligations projected working capital requirements capital spending and anticipated dividend payments for a period that includes the next twelve months as well as the next several years however our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity may be affected by numerous factors many of which are outside of our control depending on our liquidity levels conditions in the capital markets and other factors we may from time to time consider the issuance of debt equity or other securities the proceeds of which could provide additional liquidity for our operations 

  

for fiscal 2019 we anticipate potential combined borrowings under the revolving facility and cp notes to be a maximum of approximately 800 million outstanding at any one time including any anticipated borrowings to fund repurchases of common stock 

  

revolving credit facility 

  

on february 22 2017 we entered into the revolving facility of which up to 1750 million is available for the issuance of letters of credit and which is scheduled to mature on february 22 2022 

  

borrowings under the revolving facility bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable interest rate margin plus at our option either a libor or b a base rate which is usually equal to the prime rate the applicable interest rate margin for borrowings as of february 1 2019 was 110 for libor borrowings and 010 for baserate borrowings we must also pay a facility fee payable on any used and unused commitment amounts of the revolving facility and customary fees on letters of credit issued under the revolving facility as of february 1 2019 the commitment fee rate was 015 the applicable interest rate margins for borrowings the facility fees and the letter of credit fees under the revolving facility are subject to adjustment from time to time based on our longterm senior unsecured debt ratings 

  

the revolving facility contains a number of customary affirmative and negative covenants that among other things restrict subject to certain exceptions our including our subsidiaries’ ability to incur additional liens sell all or substantially all of our assets consummate certain fundamental changes or change in our lines of business and incur additional subsidiary indebtedness the revolving facility also contains financial covenants that require the maintenance of a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio as of february 1 2019 we were in compliance with all such covenants the revolving facility also contains customary events of default 

 

  

as of february 1 2019 under the revolving facility we had no outstanding borrowings outstanding letters of credit of 76 million and borrowing availability of 12 billion that due to our intention to maintain borrowing availability related to the commercial paper program described below could contribute incremental liquidity of 6895 million at february 1 2019 in addition as of february 1 2019 we had outstanding letters of credit of 329 million which were issued pursuant to separate agreements 

  

commercial paper 

  

as of february 1 2019 our consolidated balance sheet reflected outstanding unsecured cp notes of 3669 million classified as longterm obligations due to our intent and ability to refinance these obligations as longterm debt an additional 1860 million of outstanding cp notes were held by a whollyowned subsidiary and are therefore not reflected on the consolidated balance sheet under this program we may issue the cp notes from time to time in an aggregate amount not to exceed 10 billion outstanding at any time the cp notes may have maturities of up to 364 days from the date of issue and rank equal in right of payment with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness we intend to maintain available commitments under the revolving facility in an amount at least equal to the amount of cp notes outstanding at any time as of february 1 2019 the consolidated outstanding cp notes had a weighted average borrowing rate of 27 

  

senior notes 

  

in april 2013 we issued 9000 million aggregate principal amount of 325 senior notes due 2023 the “2023 senior notes” at a discount of 24 million which are scheduled to mature on april 15 2023 in october 2015 we issued 5000 million aggregate principal amount of 4150 senior notes due 2025 the “2025 senior notes” at a discount of 08 million which are scheduled to mature on november 1 2025 in april 2017 we issued 6000 million aggregate principal amount of 3875 senior notes due 2027 the “2027 senior notes” at a discount of 04 million which are scheduled to mature on april 15 2027 in april 2018 we issued 5000 million aggregate principal amount of 4125 senior notes due 2028 the “2028 senior notes” at a discount of 05 million which are scheduled to mature on may 1 2028 collectively the 2023 senior notes 2025 senior notes 2027 senior notes and 2028 senior notes comprise the “senior notes” each of which were issued pursuant to an indenture as supplemented and amended by supplemental indentures relating to each series of senior notes as so supplemented and amended the “senior indenture” interest on the 2023 senior notes and the 2027 senior notes is payable in cash on april 15 and october 15 of each year interest on the 2025 and 2028 senior notes is payable in cash on may 1 and november 1 of each year interest payments on the 2028 senior notes commenced on november 1 2018 

  

we may redeem some or all of the senior notes at any time at redemption prices set forth in the senior indenture upon the occurrence of a change of control triggering event which is defined in the senior indenture each holder of our senior notes has the right to require us to repurchase some or all of such holder’s senior notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101 of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest if any to but excluding the repurchase date 

  

the senior indenture contains covenants limiting among other things our ability subject to certain exceptions to consolidate merge or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets and our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur or guarantee indebtedness secured by liens on any shares of voting stock of significant subsidiaries 

  

the senior indenture also provides for events of default which if any of them occurs would permit or require the principal of and accrued interest on our senior notes to become or to be declared due and payable as applicable

on march 13 2019 the board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 032 per share which is payable on or before april 23 2019 to shareholders of record of our common stock on april 9 2019 we paid quarterly cash dividends of 029 per share in 2018 although the board currently expects to continue regular quarterly cash dividends the declaration and amount of future cash dividends are subject to the board’s sole discretion and will depend upon among other factors our results of operations cash requirements financial condition contractual restrictions and other factors that our board may deem relevant in its sole discretion 

  

our inventory balance represented approximately 53 of our total assets exclusive of goodwill and other intangible assets as of february 1 2019 our ability to effectively manage our inventory balances can have a significant impact on our cash flows from operations during a given fiscal year inventory purchases are often somewhat seasonal in nature such as the purchase of warmweather or christmasrelated merchandise efficient management of our inventory has been and continues to be an area of focus for us 

  

as described in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements we are involved in a number of legal actions and claims some of which could potentially result in material cash payments adverse developments in those actions could materially and adversely affect our liquidity 

  

cash flows 

  

cash flows from operating activities cash flows from operating activities were 21 billion in 2018 which represents a 3414 million increase compared to 2017 changes in accounts payable resulted in a 3752 million increase in 2018 compared to a 4279 million increase in 2017 due primarily to the timing of receipts and payments which was partially impacted by certain changes in payment terms in addition net income increased by 505 million in 2018 over 2017 these items were offset by changes in merchandise inventories which resulted in a 5213 million decrease in 2018 as compared to a decrease of 3484 million in 2017 changes in income taxes in 2018 compared to 2017 are primarily due to the reduction in the federal income tax rate to 21 from 35 and the timing of payments for income taxes 

  

cash flows from operating activities were 18 billion in 2017 which represents a 1971 million increase compared to 2016 net income increased by 2878 million in 2017 over 2016 offset by changes in merchandise inventories which resulted in a 3484 million decrease in 2017 as compared to a decrease of 1719 million in 2016 changes in accounts payable resulted in a 4279 million increase in 2017 compared to a 565 million increase in 2016 due primarily to the timing of receipts and payments which was partially impacted by certain changes in payment terms 

  

on an ongoing basis we closely monitor and manage our inventory balances and they may fluctuate from period to period based on new store openings the timing of purchases and other factors merchandise 

 

inventories increased by 14 in 2018 by 11 in 2017 and by 6 in 2016 inventory levels in the consumables category increased by 3209 million or 14 in 2018 by 3229 million or 16 in 2017 and by 545 million or 3 in 2016 the seasonal category increased by 1084 million or 17 in 2018 by 149 million or 2 in 2017 and by 795 million or 15 in 2016 the home products category increased by 240 million or 7 in 2018 by 106 million or 3 in 2017 and by 408 million or 14 in 2016 the apparel category increased by 347 million or 10 in 2018 by 19 million or 1 in 2017 and by 99 million or 3 in 2016 

  

cash flows from investing activities  significant components of property and equipment purchases in 2018 included the following approximate amounts 289 million for improvements upgrades remodels and relocations of existing stores 242 million for distribution and transportationrelated projects 138 million for new leased stores primarily for leasehold improvements fixtures and equipment and 47 million for information systems upgrades and technologyrelated projects the timing of new remodeled and relocated store openings along with other factors may affect the relationship between such openings and the related property and equipment purchases in any given period during 2018 we opened 900 new stores and remodeled or relocated 1165 stores 

  

significant components of property and equipment purchases in 2017 included the following approximate amounts 231 million for improvements upgrades remodels and relocations of existing stores 203 million for new leased stores primarily for leasehold improvements fixtures and equipment 176 million for distribution and transportationrelated projects and 30 million for information systems upgrades and technologyrelated projects during 2017 we opened 1315 new stores and remodeled or relocated 764 stores 

  

significant components of property and equipment purchases in 2016 included the following approximate amounts 201 million for distribution and transportationrelated projects 168 million for improvements upgrades remodels and relocations of existing stores 120 million for new leased stores primarily for leasehold improvements fixtures and equipment 38 million for stores purchased or built by us and 26 million for information systems upgrades and technologyrelated projects during 2016 we opened 900 new stores and remodeled or relocated 906 stores 

  

capital expenditures during 2019 are projected to be in the range of 775 million to 825 million we anticipate funding 2019 capital requirements with a combination of some or all of the following existing cash balances cash flows from operations availability under our revolving facility andor the issuance of additional senior notes or cp notes we plan to continue to invest in store growth and development of approximately 975 new stores and approximately 1100 stores to be remodeled or relocated capital expenditures in 2019 are anticipated to support our store growth as well as our remodel and relocation initiatives including capital outlays for leasehold improvements fixtures and equipment the construction of new stores costs to support and enhance our supply chain initiatives including new and existing distribution center facilities and our private fleet technology initiatives as well as routine and ongoing capital requirements 

  

cash flows from financing activities  in 2018 we had net proceeds from the issuance of the 2028 senior notes of 4995 million redeemed the 2018 senior notes for 4000 million and made a principal payment on the term facility of 1750 million we had a net decrease in consolidated commercial paper borrowings in 2018 of 633 million and had no borrowings or repayments under the revolving facility we repurchased 99 million outstanding shares of our common stock in 2018 at a total cost of 10 billion and paid cash dividends of 3065 million 

  

in 2017 we had net proceeds from the issuance of the 2027 senior notes of 5996 million redeemed the 2017 senior notes for 5000 million and made a principal payment on the term facility of 2500 million we had a net decrease in consolidated commercial paper borrowings in 2017 of 603 million and had no borrowings or repayments under the revolving facility we repurchased 71 million outstanding shares of our common stock in 2017 at a total cost of 5797 million and paid cash dividends of 2829 million 

  

 

in 2016 we had net commercial paper borrowings of 4905 million and net repayments under the revolving facility of 2510 million we repurchased 124 million outstanding shares of our common stock at a total cost of 10 billion and paid cash dividends of 2811 million 

  

accounting standards 

  

in february 2016 the fasb issued new guidance related to lease accounting which requires a dual approach for lessee accounting under which a lessee will account for leases as finance leases or operating leases both finance leases and operating leases will result in the lessee recognizing a rightofuse asset and a corresponding lease liability on its balance sheet with differing methodology for income statement recognition this guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2018 and early adoption is permitted in july 2018 the fasb issued additional guidance which allows companies to record the cumulative effect of applying the new standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the year of adoption which we will apply we formed a project team to assess and implement the standard and an executive steering committee to provide oversight the project team has completed its internal evaluation of existing contractual arrangements for embedded leases has successfully tested computations in our lease administration system and has developed a process to compute the rates to discount the lease liabilities as required by the standard in addition the project team has identified and implemented new processes and controls to ensure compliance with the new standard and has evaluated and documented our accounting conclusions related to the new standard we will utilize transition practical expedients under which we will not be required to reassess i whether expired or existing contracts are or contain leases as defined by the new standard ii the classification of such leases and iii whether previously capitalized initial direct costs would qualify for capitalization under the new standard we have identified our store leases as the area in which we will be most affected by the new guidance and the most significant impact that adoption will have on our consolidated financial statements is to our consolidated balance sheet we expect to record consolidated right of use assets and consolidated lease liabilities of approximately 80 billion each upon transition to the new guidance 

  

in january 2017 the fasb issued amendments to existing guidance related to the subsequent measurement of goodwill these amendments modify the concept of impairment from the condition that exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value to the condition that exists when the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value subsequent to adoption an entity will perform its annual or interim goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value this guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2019 and early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after january 1 2017 the amendments should be applied on a prospective basis an entity is required to disclose the nature of and reason for the change in accounting principle upon transition we currently do not anticipate a material effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows to result from the adoption of this guidance 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “us gaap” requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures in addition to the estimates presented below there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed critical as defined below we believe these estimates are reasonable and appropriate however if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used the resulting changes could have a material effect on the financial statements taken as a whole 

  

management believes the following policies and estimates are critical because they involve significant judgments assumptions and estimates management has discussed the development and selection of the critical 

 

accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosures presented below relating to those policies and estimates see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of our principal accounting policies 

  

merchandise inventories  merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market “lcm” with cost determined using the retail last in first out “lifo” method we use the retail inventory method “rim” to calculate gross profit and the resulting valuation of inventories at cost which are computed utilizing a calculated costtoretail inventory ratio at an inventory department level we apply the rim to these departments which are groups of products that are fairly uniform in terms of cost selling price relationship and turnover the rim will result in valuing inventories at lcm if permanent markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories inherent in the retail inventory method calculation are certain management judgments and estimates that may impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the gross profit recognized these judgments include ensuring departments consist of similar products recording estimated shrinkage between physical inventories and timely recording of markdowns needed to sell inventory 

  

we perform an annual lifo analysis whereby all merchandise units are considered for inclusion in the index formulation an actual valuation of inventory under the lifo method is made at the end of each year based on the inventory levels and costs at that time in contrast interim lifo calculations are based on management’s annual estimates of sales the rate of inflation or deflation and yearend inventory levels we also perform analyses for determining obsolete inventory adjusting inventory on a quarterly basis to an lcm value based on various management assumptions including estimated below cost markdowns not yet recorded but required to liquidate such inventory in future periods 

  

factors considered in the determination of markdowns include current and anticipated demand based on changes in competitors’ practices consumer preferences consumer spending significant weather events and unseasonable weather patterns certain of these factors are outside of our control and may result in greater than estimated markdowns to entice consumer purchases of excess inventory the amount and timing of markdowns may vary significantly from year to year 

  

we perform physical inventories in virtually all of our stores on an annual basis we calculate our shrink provision based on actual physical inventory results during the fiscal period and an accrual for estimated shrink occurring subsequent to a physical inventory through the end of the fiscal reporting period this accrual is calculated as a percentage of sales at each retail store at a department level based on the store’s most recent historical shrink rate to the extent that subsequent physical inventories yield different results than the estimated accrual our effective shrink rate for a given reporting period will include the impact of adjusting to the actual results 

  

we believe our estimates and assumptions related to the application of the rim results in a merchandise inventory valuation that reasonably approximates cost on a consistent basis 

  

goodwill and other intangible assets the qualitative and quantitative assessments related to the valuation and any potential impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets are each subject to judgments andor assumptions the analysis of qualitative factors may include determining the appropriate factors to consider and the relative importance of those factors along with other assumptions if required judgments in the quantitative testing process may include projecting future cash flows determining appropriate discount rates correctly applying valuation techniques correctly computing the implied fair value of goodwill if necessary and other assumptions future cash flow projections are based on management’s projections and represent best estimates taking into account recent financial performance market trends strategic plans and other available information which in recent years have been materially accurate changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value or impairment however such a conclusion is not indicated by recent analyses future indicators of impairment could result in an asset impairment charge if these judgments or assumptions are incorrect or flawed the analysis could be negatively impacted 

  

 

our most recent evaluation of our goodwill and indefinite lived trade name intangible assets was completed during the third quarter of 2018 no indicators of impairment were evident and no assessment of or adjustment to these assets was required we are not currently projecting a decline in cash flows that could be expected to have an adverse effect such as a violation of debt covenants or future impairment charges 

  

property and equipment  property and equipment are recorded at cost we group our assets into relatively homogeneous classes and generally provide for depreciation on a straightline basis over the estimated average useful life of each asset class except for leasehold improvements which are amortized over the lesser of the applicable lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset certain store and warehouse fixtures when fully depreciated are removed from the cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization accounts the valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of depreciable lives involves judgments and the use of estimates which we believe have been materially accurate in recent years 

  

impairment of longlived assets impairment of longlived assets results when the carrying value of the assets exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows generated by the assets our estimate of undiscounted future store cash flows is based upon historical operations of the stores and estimates of future profitability which encompasses many factors that are subject to variability and are difficult to predict if our estimates of future cash flows are not materially accurate our impairment analysis could be impacted accordingly if a longlived asset is found to be impaired the amount recognized for impairment is equal to the difference between the carrying value and the asset’s estimated fair value the fair value is estimated based primarily upon projected future cash flows discounted at our credit adjusted riskfree rate or other reasonable estimates of fair market value although not currently anticipated changes in these estimates assumptions or projections could materially affect the determination of fair value or impairment 

  

insurance liabilities  we retain a significant portion of the risk for our workers’ compensation employee health general liability property loss automobile and thirdparty landlord claim exposures these represent significant costs primarily due to our large employee base and number of stores provisions are made for these liabilities on an undiscounted basis certain of these liabilities are based on actual claim data and estimates of incurred but not reported claims developed using actuarial methodologies based on historical claim trends which have been and are anticipated to continue to be materially accurate if future claim trends deviate from recent historical patterns or other unanticipated events affect the number and significance of future claims we may be required to record additional expenses or expense reductions which could be material to our future financial results 

  

contingent liabilities – income taxes income tax reserves are determined using the methodology established by accounting standards relating to uncertainty in income taxes these standards require companies to assess each income tax position taken using a twostep process a determination is first made as to whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained based upon the technical merits upon examination by the taxing authorities if the tax position is expected to meet the more likely than not criteria the benefit recorded for the tax position equals the largest amount that is greater than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement of the respective tax position uncertain tax positions require determinations and liabilities to be estimated based on provisions of the tax law which may be subject to change or varying interpretation if our determinations and estimates prove to be inaccurate the resulting adjustments could be material to our future financial results 

  

contingent liabilities  legal matters    we are subject to legal regulatory and other proceedings and claims we establish liabilities as appropriate for these claims and proceedings based upon the probability and estimability of losses and to fairly present in conjunction with the disclosures of these matters in our financial statements and sec filings management’s view of our exposure we review outstanding claims and proceedings with external counsel as needed to assess probability and estimates of loss which includes an analysis of whether such loss estimates are probable reasonably possible or remote we reevaluate these assessments on a quarterly basis or as new and significant information becomes available to determine whether a liability should be established or if any existing liability should be adjusted the actual cost of resolving a claim or proceeding ultimately may be substantially different than the amount of the recorded liability in addition because it is not 

 

permissible under us gaap to establish a litigation liability until the loss is both probable and estimable in some cases there may be insufficient time to establish a liability prior to the actual incurrence of the loss upon verdict and judgment at trial for example or in the case of a quickly negotiated settlement 

  

lease accounting and excess facilities  many of our stores are subject to buildtosuit arrangements with landlords which typically carry a primary lease term of up to 15 years with multiple renewal options we also have stores subject to shorterterm leases and many of these leases have renewal options certain of our stores have provisions for contingent rentals based upon a percentage of defined sales volume we recognize contingent rental expense when the achievement of specified sales targets is considered probable we record minimum rental expense on a straightline basis over the base noncancelable lease term commencing on the date that we take physical possession of the property from the landlord which normally includes a period prior to store opening to make necessary leasehold improvements and install store fixtures when a lease contains a predetermined fixed escalation of the minimum rent we recognize the related rent expense on a straightline basis and record the difference between the recognized rental expense and the amounts payable under the lease as deferred rent tenant allowances to the extent received are recorded as deferred incentive rent and amortized as a reduction to rent expense over the term of the lease we reflect as a liability any difference between the calculated expense and the amounts actually paid improvements of leased properties are amortized over the shorter of the life of the applicable lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset 

  

sharebased payments  our stock option awards are valued on an individual grant basis using the blackscholesmerton closed form option pricing model we believe that this model fairly estimates the value of our stock option awards the application of this valuation model involves assumptions that are judgmental in the valuation of stock options which affects compensation expense related to these options these assumptions include the term that the options are expected to be outstanding the historical volatility of our stock price applicable interest rates and the dividend yield of our stock other factors involving judgments that affect the expensing of sharebased payments include estimated forfeiture rates of sharebased awards historically these estimates have been materially accurate however if our estimates differ materially from actual experience we may be required to record additional expense or reductions of expense which could be material to our future financial results 

  

fair value measurements accounting standards for the measurement of fair value of assets and liabilities establish a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity observable inputs that are classified within levels 1 and 2 of the hierarchy and the reporting entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions unobservable inputs classified within level 3 of the hierarchy therefore level 3 inputs are typically based on an entity’s own assumptions as there is little if any related market activity and thus require the use of significant judgment and estimates currently we have no assets or liabilities that are valued based solely on level 3 inputs 

  

our fair value measurements are primarily associated with our outstanding debt instruments we use various valuation models in determining the values of these liabilities we believe that in recent years these methodologies have produced materially accurate valuations 

  

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

financial risk management 

  

we are exposed to market risk primarily from adverse changes in interest rates and to a lesser degree commodity prices to minimize this risk we may periodically use financial instruments including derivatives all derivative financial instrument transactions must be authorized and executed pursuant to approval by the board of directors as a matter of policy we do not buy or sell financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes and any such derivative financial instruments are intended to be used to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure our objective is to correlate derivative financial instruments and the underlying exposure being hedged so that fluctuations in the value of the financial instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying economic exposure 

  

interest rate risk 

  

we manage our interest rate risk through the strategic use of fixed and variable interest rate debt and from time to time derivative financial instruments our principal interest rate exposure relates to outstanding amounts under our unsecured revolving credit facility as well as our commercial paper program as of february 1 2019 we had consolidated borrowings of 3669 million under our commercial paper program and no borrowings outstanding under our revolving facility in order to mitigate a portion of the variable rate interest exposure under the credit facilities in prior years we have entered into various interest rate swaps as of february 1 2019 no such interest rate swaps were outstanding and as a result we are exposed to fluctuations in variable interest rates under the revolving facility and our commercial paper program for a detailed discussion of our revolving facility and our commercial paper program see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

a change in interest rates on variable rate debt impacts our pretax earnings and cash flows whereas a change in interest rates on fixed rate debt impacts the economic fair value of debt but not our pretax earnings and cash flows based on our variable rate borrowing levels as of february 1 2019 and february 2 2018 the annualized effect of a one percentage point increase in variable interest rates would have resulted in a pretax reduction of our earnings and cash flows of approximately 37 million in 2018 and 61 million in 2017

definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting 

  

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that 

 

controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate

 item 1 business 

  

general 

  

we are among the largest discount retailers in the united states by number of stores with 14609 stores located in 44 states as of march 2 2018 with the greatest concentration of stores in the southern southwestern midwestern and eastern united states we offer a broad selection of merchandise including consumables seasonal items home products and apparel our merchandise includes national brands from leading manufacturers as well as our own private brand selections with prices at substantial discounts to national brands we offer our customers these national brand and private brand products at everyday low prices typically 10 or less in our convenient smallbox locations 

  

our history 

  

jl turner founded our company in 1939 as jl turner and son wholesale we were incorporated as a kentucky corporation under the name jl turner  son inc in 1955 when we opened our first dollar general store we changed our name to dollar general corporation in 1968 and reincorporated in 1998 as a tennessee corporation our common stock was publicly traded from 1968 until july 2007 when we merged with an entity controlled by investment funds affiliated with kohlberg kravis roberts  co lp or kkr in november 2009 our common stock again became publicly traded and in december 2013 the entity controlled by investment funds affiliated with kkr sold its remaining shares of our common stock 

  

our business model 

  

our long history of profitable growth is founded on a commitment to a relatively simple business model providing a broad base of customers with their basic everyday and household needs supplemented with a variety of general merchandise items at everyday low prices in conveniently located smallbox stores we continually evaluate the needs and demands of our customers and modify our merchandise selections and pricing accordingly while remaining focused on increasing profitability cash generation and returns for our shareholders 

  

our longterm operating priorities remain 1 driving profitable sales growth 2 capturing growth opportunities 3 enhancing our position as a lowcost operator and 4 investing in our people as a competitive advantage for more information on these operating priorities see the “executive overview” section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in part ii item 7 of this report 

  

in fiscal year 2017 we achieved our 28th consecutive year of positive samestore sales growth we believe that this growth which has taken place in a variety of economic conditions is a result of our compelling value and convenience proposition although no assurances can be given that we will achieve positive samestore sales growth in any given year 

  

compelling value and convenience proposition our ability to deliver highly competitive prices in convenient locations and our easy “in and out” shopping format create a compelling shopping experience that we believe distinguishes us from other discount retailers as well as convenience drug grocery online and mass merchant retailers our slogan “save time save money every day” summarizes our appeal to customers we believe our ability to effectively deliver both value and convenience allows us to succeed in small markets with limited shopping alternatives as well as in larger and more competitive markets our value and convenience proposition is evidenced by the following attributes of our business model 

  



 



  



  



  

substantial growth opportunities we believe we have substantial longterm growth potential in the us we have identified significant opportunities to add new stores in both existing and new markets in addition we have opportunities to relocate or remodel locations within our existing store base to better serve our customers our attractive store economics including a relatively low initial investment and simple lowcost operating model have allowed us to grow our store base to current levels and provide us significant opportunities to continue our profitable store growth strategy 

  

our merchandise 

  

we offer a focused assortment of everyday necessities which we believe helps to drive frequent customer visits and key items in a broad range of general merchandise categories our product assortment provides the opportunity for our customers to address most of their basic shopping needs with one trip we offer a wide selection of nationally advertised brands from leading manufacturers additionally our private brand products offer even greater value with options to purchase products that we believe to be of comparable quality to national brands as well as value items each at substantial discounts to the national brands 

  

consumables is our largest merchandise category and has become a larger percentage of our total sales in recent years as indicated in the table below consumables include paper and cleaning products such as paper towels bath tissue paper dinnerware trash and storage bags laundry and other home cleaning supplies packaged food such as cereals canned soups and vegetables condiments spices sugar and flour perishables such as milk eggs bread refrigerated and frozen food beer and wine snacks such as candy cookies crackers salty snacks and carbonated beverages health and beauty such as overthecounter medicines and personal care products including soap body wash shampoo dental hygiene and foot care products pet such as pet supplies and pet food and tobacco products 

  

seasonal products include decorations toys batteries small electronics greeting cards stationery prepaid phones and accessories gardening supplies hardware automotive and home office supplies 

  

home products include kitchen supplies cookware small appliances light bulbs storage containers frames candles craft supplies and kitchen bed and bath soft goods 

  

apparel includes casual everyday apparel for infants toddlers girls boys women and men as well as socks underwear disposable diapers shoes and accessories 

 

  

the percentage of net sales of each of our four categories of merchandise for the fiscal years indicated below was as follows 

  



  

our seasonal and home products categories typically account for the highest gross profit margins and the consumables category typically accounts for the lowest gross profit margin 

  

the dollar general store 

  

the typical dollar general store is operated by a store manager one or more assistant store managers and three or more sales associates our stores generally feature a lowcost no frills building with limited maintenance capital low operating costs and a focused merchandise offering within a broad range of categories allowing us to deliver low retail prices while generating strong cash flows and capital investment returns our stores average approximately 7400 square feet of selling space and approximately 75 of our stores are located in towns of 20000 or fewer people we generally have had good success in locating suitable store sites in the past and we believe that there is ample opportunity for new store growth in existing and new markets in addition we believe we have significant opportunities available for our relocation and remodel programs 

  

our store growth over the past three years is summarized in the following table 

  



  

our customers 

  

our customers seek value and convenience depending on their financial situation and geographic proximity customers’ reliance on dollar general varies from fillin shopping to making periodic trips to stock up on household items to making weekly or more frequent trips to meet most essential needs we generally locate our stores and plan our merchandise selections to best serve the needs of our core customers the low and fixed income households often underserved by other retailers and we are focused on helping them make the most of their spending dollars at the same time however loyal dollar general shoppers from a wide range of income brackets and life stages appreciate our quality merchandise as well as our attractive value and convenience proposition 

  

our suppliers 

  

we purchase merchandise from a wide variety of suppliers and maintain direct buying relationships with many producers of national brand merchandise despite our broad offering we maintain only a limited number of items per category allowing us to keep our average costs low our largest and second largest suppliers each accounted for approximately 8 of our purchases in 2017 our private brands come from a diversified supplier base we directly imported approximately 5 of our purchases at cost in 2017 

  

 

we have consistently managed to obtain sufficient quantities of core merchandise and believe that if one or more of our current sources of supply became unavailable we generally would be able to obtain alternative sources however such alternative sources could increase our merchandise costs or reduce the quality of our merchandise and an inability to obtain alternative sources could adversely affect our sales 

  

distribution and transportation 

  

our stores are currently supported by fifteen distribution centers located strategically throughout our geographic footprint our sixteenth and seventeenth distribution centers in longview texas and amsterdam new york respectively are under construction and each is expected to be completed in 2019 we lease additional temporary warehouse space as necessary to support our distribution needs we continually analyze and rebalance the network to ensure that it remains efficient and provides the service levels our stores require see “—properties” below for additional information pertaining to our distribution centers 

  

most of our merchandise flows through our distribution centers and is delivered to our stores by thirdparty trucking firms utilizing our trailers we also own 79 semitrailer trucks with which we transport our merchandise in addition vendors or thirdparty distributors ship certain food items and other merchandise directly to our stores 

  

seasonality 

  

our business is somewhat seasonal generally our most profitable sales mix occurs in the fourth quarter which includes the christmas selling season in addition our quarterly results can be affected by the timing of certain holidays the timing of new store openings and store closings and the amount of sales contributed by new and existing stores we typically purchase substantial amounts of inventory in the third quarter and incur higher shipping and payroll costs in the third quarter in anticipation of increased sales activity during the fourth quarter see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

  

our competition 

  

we operate in the basic discount consumer goods market which is highly competitive with respect to price store location merchandise quality assortment and presentation instock consistency and customer service we compete with discount stores and with many other retailers including mass merchandise warehouse club grocery drug convenience variety online and certain specialty stores these other retail companies operate stores in many of the areas where we operate and many of them engage in extensive advertising and marketing efforts our direct competitors include family dollar dollar tree big lots fred’s 99 cents only and various local independent operators as well as walmart target kroger aldi lidl walgreens cvs and riteaid among others certain of our competitors have greater financial distribution marketing and other resources than we do competition has intensified and we believe it will continue to do so as competitors move into or increase their presence in our geographic and product markets and increase the availability of mobile webbased and other digital technology to facilitate a more convenient and competitive customer online and instore shopping experience 

  

we believe that we differentiate ourselves from other forms of retailing by offering consistently low prices in a convenient smallstore format we believe that our prices are competitive due in part to our lowcost operating structure and the relatively limited assortment of products offered purchasing large volumes of merchandise within our focused assortment in each merchandise category allows us to keep our average costs low contributing to our ability to offer competitive everyday low prices to our customers see “—our business model” above for further discussion of our competitive situation 

  

 

our employees 

  

as of march 2 2018 we employed approximately 129000 fulltime and parttime employees including divisional and regional managers district managers store managers other store personnel and distribution center and administrative personnel we have increasingly focused on recruiting training motivating and retaining employees and we believe that the quality performance and morale of our employees continue to be an important part of our success in recent years we believe our overall relationship with our employees is good

 item 1a risk factors 

  

you should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information contained in this report and other filings that we make from time to time with the sec including our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations or liquidity these risks are not the only risks we face our business financial condition results of operations or liquidity could also be adversely affected by additional factors that apply to all companies generally or by risks not currently known to us or that we currently view to be immaterial we can provide no assurance and make no representation that our risk mitigation efforts although we believe they are reasonable will be successful 

  

economic conditions and other economic factors may adversely affect our financial performance and other aspects of our business by negatively impacting our customers’ disposable income or discretionary spending affecting our ability to plan and execute our strategic initiatives increasing our costs of goods sold and selling general and administrative expenses and adversely affecting our sales or profitability 

  

we believe many of our customers have fixed or low incomes and generally have limited discretionary spending dollars any factor that could adversely affect that disposable income would decrease our customers’ confidence spending and number of trips to our stores and could cause our customers to shift their spending to products other than those sold by us or to our less profitable product choices all of which could result in lower net sales decreases in inventory turnover greater markdowns on inventory a change in the mix of products we sell and a reduction in profitability due to lower margins factors that could reduce our customers’ disposable income and over which we exercise no influence include but are not limited to adverse economic conditions such as increased or sustained high unemployment or underemployment levels inflation increases in fuel or other energy costs and interest rates lack of available credit consumer debt levels higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws uncertainty regarding government mandated participation in health insurance programs increasing healthcare and housing costs and decreases in or elimination of government subsidies such as unemployment and food assistance programs 

  

many of the factors identified above that affect disposable income as well as commodity rates transportation costs including the costs of fuel costs of labor insurance and healthcare foreign exchange rate fluctuations lease costs measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade including increased import duties or tariffs or changes in other laws and regulations and other economic factors also affect our ability to plan and execute our strategic initiatives our cost of goods sold our selling general and administrative expenses and our real estate costs and may have other adverse consequences which we are unable to fully anticipate or control all of which may adversely affect our sales or profitability we have limited or no ability to control many of these factors 

  

our plans depend significantly on strategies and initiatives designed to increase sales and profit and improve the efficiencies costs and effectiveness of our operations and failure to achieve or sustain these plans could affect our performance adversely 

  

we have shortterm and longterm strategies and initiatives such as those relating to merchandising marketing real estate and new store development digital sourcing shrink private brand inventory management distribution and transportation store operations store formats budgeting and expense reduction and technology in various stages of testing evaluation and implementation upon which we expect to rely to continue to improve our results of operations and financial condition and to achieve our financial plans these initiatives are inherently risky and uncertain even when tested successfully in their application to our business in general it is possible that successful testing can result partially from resources and attention that cannot be duplicated in broader implementation particularly in light of the diverse geographic locations of our stores and the decentralized nature of our field management general implementation also may be negatively affected by other risk factors described herein successful systemwide implementation relies on consistency of training stability of workforce ease of execution and the absence of offsetting factors that can influence results adversely failure to achieve successful 

 

implementation of our initiatives or the cost of these initiatives exceeding management’s estimates could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the success of our merchandising initiatives particularly those with respect to nonconsumable merchandise and storespecific products and allocations depends in part upon our ability to predict consistently and successfully the products that our customers will demand and to identify and timely respond to evolving trends in demographic mixes in our markets and consumer preferences expectations and needs if we are unable to select products that are attractive to customers to timely obtain such products at costs that allow us to sell them at an acceptable profit or to effectively market such products our sales market share and profitability could be adversely affected if our merchandising efforts in the nonconsumables area or the higher margin areas within consumables are unsuccessful we could be further adversely affected by our inability to offset the lower margins associated with our consumables business 

  

if we cannot open relocate or remodel stores profitably and on schedule our planned future growth will be impeded which would adversely affect sales 

  

our ability to open relocate and remodel profitable stores is a key component of our planned future growth our ability to timely open stores and to expand into additional market areas depends in part on the following factors the availability of attractive store locations the absence of entitlement process or occupancy delays the ability to negotiate acceptable lease and development terms the ability to hire and train new personnel especially store managers in a cost effective manner the ability to identify customer demand in different geographic areas general economic conditions and the availability of capital funding for expansion many of these factors also affect our ability to successfully relocate stores and many of them are beyond our control 

  

delays or failures in opening new stores or completing relocations or remodels or achieving lower than expected sales in these projects could materially adversely affect our growth andor profitability we also may not anticipate all of the challenges imposed by the expansion of our operations and as a result may not meet our targets for opening new stores remodeling or relocating stores or expanding profitably in addition our construction costs could increase as a result of economic factors discussed above 

  

some new stores and future new store opportunities may be located in areas including but not limited to new states or metro urban areas where we have limited or no meaningful experience or brand recognition those areas may have different competitive and market conditions consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns than our existing markets as well as higher cost of entry these factors may cause our new stores to be initially less successful than stores in our existing markets which could slow future growth in these areas 

  

many new stores will be located in areas where we have existing stores although we have experience in these areas increasing the number of locations in these markets may result in inadvertent oversaturation and temporarily or permanently divert customers and sales from our existing stores thereby adversely affecting our overall financial performance 

  

we face intense competition that could limit our growth opportunities and adversely impact our financial performance 

  

the retail business is highly competitive with respect to price store location merchandise quality product assortment and presentation instock consistency customer service promotional activity customers market share and employees we compete with discount stores and with many other retailers including mass merchandise warehouse club grocery drug convenience variety online retailers and certain specialty stores this competitive environment subjects us to the risk of adverse impact to our financial performance because of the lower prices and thus the lower margins that may be required to maintain our competitive position also as a discount retailer due to customer demographics and other factors we may have limited ability to increase prices in response to increased costs without losing competitive position this limitation may adversely affect our margins and financial performance certain of our competitors have greater financial distribution marketing and other resources than we do and may be able to secure better arrangements with suppliers than we can if we fail to 

 

respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets it could adversely affect our financial performance 

competition for customers has intensified as competitors have moved into or increased their presence in our geographic and product markets and increased the availability of mobile webbased and other digital technology to facilitate a more convenient and competitive customer online and instore shopping experience we expect this competition to continue to increase we remain vulnerable to the marketing power and high level of consumer recognition of larger competitors and to the risk that these competitors or others could venture into our industry in a significant way including through the introduction of new store formats further consolidation within the retail industry could significantly alter the competitive dynamics of the retail marketplace this consolidation may result in competitors with greatly improved financial resources improved access to merchandise greater market penetration and other improvements in their competitive positions as well as result in the provision of a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices by these consolidated companies which could adversely affect our financial performance 

  

our profitability may be negatively affected by inventory shrinkage 

  

we are subject to the risk of inventory loss and theft we experience significant inventory shrinkage and cannot be sure that incidences of inventory loss and theft will decrease in the future or that the measures we are taking will effectively reduce the problem of inventory shrinkage although some level of inventory shrinkage is an unavoidable cost of doing business if we were to experience higher rates of inventory shrinkage or incur increased security or other costs to combat inventory theft our results of operations and financial condition could be affected adversely 

  

our cash flows from operations may be negatively affected if we are not successful in managing our inventory balances 

  

our inventory balance represented approximately 52 of our total assets exclusive of goodwill and other intangible assets as of february 2 2018 efficient inventory management is a key component of our business success and profitability to be successful we must maintain sufficient inventory levels and an appropriate product mix to meet our customers’ demands without allowing those levels to increase to such an extent that the costs to store and hold the goods unduly impacts our financial results or that subjects us to the risk of increased inventory shrinkage if our buying decisions do not accurately predict customer trends we inappropriately price products or our expectations about customer spending levels are inaccurate we may have to take unanticipated markdowns to dispose of the excess inventory which also can adversely impact our financial results we continue to focus on ways to reduce these risks but we cannot make assurances that we will be successful in our inventory management if we are not successful in managing our inventory balances our cash flows from operations may be negatively affected 

  

any failure to maintain the security of information we hold relating to proprietary business information or our customers employees and vendors whether as a result of cybersecurity attacks or otherwise could expose us to litigation government enforcement actions and costly response measures and could materially disrupt our operations and harm our reputation and sales 

  

in connection with sales we transmit confidential credit and debit card information we also have access to collect or maintain certain private or confidential information regarding our customers employees and vendors as well as our business some of this information is stored digitally in connection with our ecommerce website and our mobile applications some of which may leverage thirdparty service providers additionally under certain circumstances we may share information with vendors that assist us in conducting our business for example thirdparty service providers assist us in the transmittal of credit and debit card information in connection with sales as required by law or otherwise in accordance with our privacy policy while we have implemented procedures and technology intended to protect and safeguard our information and require appropriate controls of our service providers it is possible that cyberattackers might compromise our security measures or those of our technology and other vendors or service providers in the future and obtain the personal information of our customers employees and vendors that we hold or our business information as cyberattacks 

 

are rapidly evolving and those threats and the means for obtaining access to information in digital and other storage media are becoming increasingly sophisticated and may not immediately produce signs of intrusion moreover employee error or malfeasance or other irregularities may result in a defeat of our or our thirdparty vendors’ security measures and breach our or our thirdparty vendors’ information systems if customer passwords are obtained through unrelated thirdparty breaches cyberattackers also could gain access to our customers’ accounts 

  

because we accept debit and credit cards for payment we are subject to industry data protection standards and protocols such as the payment card industry data security standards “pci dss” issued by the payment card industry security standards council additionally we have implemented technology in our stores to allow for the acceptance of europay mastercard and visa emv credit transactions and pointtopoint encryption complying with pci dss standards and implementing related procedures technology and information security measures require significant resources and ongoing attention however even as we comply with pci dss standards and offer emv and pointtopoint encryption technology in our stores we may be vulnerable to and unable to detect and appropriately respond to data security breaches and data loss including cybersecurity attacks or other breach of cardholder data 

  

a security breach of any kind whether experienced by us or one of our vendors which could be undetected for a period of time or any failure by us to comply with the applicable privacy and information security laws regulations and standards could expose us to risks of data loss litigation government enforcement actions fines or penalties credit card brand assessments and costly response measures including for example providing notification to and credit monitoring services for affected customers as well as further upgrades to our security measures which may not be covered by or may exceed the coverage limits of our insurance policies and could materially disrupt our operations any resulting negative media attention and publicity could significantly harm our reputation which could cause us to lose market share as a result of customers discontinuing the use of debit or credit cards in our stores or not shopping in our stores altogether and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance 

  

a significant disruption to our distribution network to the capacity of our distribution centers or to the timely receipt of inventory could adversely impact sales or increase our transportation costs which would decrease our profits 

  

we rely on our distribution and transportation network to provide goods to our stores in a timely and cost‑effective manner using various modes of transportation including ocean rail and truck we and our vendors move goods from vendor locations to our distribution centers deliveries to our stores occur from our distribution centers or directly from our vendors any disruption unanticipated or unusual expense or operational failure related to this process could affect store operations negatively for example delivery delays or increases in transportation costs including through increased fuel costs increased carrier rates or driver wages as a result of driver shortages a decrease in transportation capacity for overseas shipments or work stoppages or slowdowns could significantly decrease our ability to make sales and earn profits labor shortages or work stoppages in the transportation industry or longterm disruptions to the national and international transportation infrastructure that lead to delays or interruptions of deliveries or which would necessitate our securing alternative labor or shipping suppliers could also increase our costs or otherwise negatively affect our business 

  

we maintain a network of distribution facilities and are moving forward with plans to build new facilities to support our growth objectives delays in opening distribution centers could adversely affect our future financial performance by slowing store growth which may in turn reduce revenue growth or by increasing transportation costs in addition distributionrelated construction or expansion projects entail risks that could cause delays and cost overruns such as shortages of materials or skilled labor work stoppages unforeseen construction scheduling engineering environmental or geological problems weather interference fires or other casualty losses and unanticipated cost increases for these reasons the completion date and ultimate cost of these projects could differ significantly from initial expectations and we cannot guarantee that any project will be completed on time or within established budgets 

  

 

risks associated with or faced by our suppliers could adversely affect our financial performance 

  

the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers and we are dependent on our vendors to supply merchandise in a timely and efficient manner in 2017 our largest and second largest suppliers each accounted for approximately 8 of our purchases we have not experienced any difficulty in obtaining sufficient quantities of core merchandise and believe that if one or more of our current sources of supply became unavailable we would generally be able to obtain alternative sources however such alternative sources could increase our merchandise costs result in a temporary reduction in store inventory levels and reduce the quality of our merchandise and an inability to obtain alternative sources could adversely affect our sales additionally if a supplier fails to deliver on its commitments whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons we could experience merchandise out‑of‑stocks that could lead to lost sales and damage to our reputation 

  

we directly imported approximately 5 of our purchases measured at cost in 2017 but many of our domestic vendors directly import their products or components of their products changes to the prices and flow of these goods for any reason such as political unrest or acts of war currency fluctuations disruptions in maritime lanes port labor disputes and economic conditions and instability in the countries in which foreign suppliers are located the financial instability of suppliers suppliers’ failure to meet our standards issues with labor practices of our suppliers or labor problems they may experience such as strikes stoppages or slowdowns which could also increase labor costs during and following the disruption the availability and cost of raw materials to suppliers increased import duties merchandise quality or safety issues transport availability and cost increases in wage rates and taxes transport security inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located or from which they import are beyond our control and could adversely affect our operations and profitability while we are working to diversify our sources of imported goods and reduce the percentage of goods imported from china a substantial amount of our imported merchandise still comes from china and thus a change in the chinese leadership economic and market conditions internal economic stimulus actions or currency or other policies as well as increases in costs of labor and wage taxes could negatively impact our merchandise costs in addition the united states’ foreign trade policies duties tariffs and other impositions on imported goods trade sanctions imposed on certain countries the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade and port labor agreements are beyond our control these and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our business and financial performance as we increase our imports of merchandise from foreign vendors the risks associated with these imports also will increase and we may be exposed to additional or different risks as we increase imports of goods produced in countries other than china 

  

product liability product recall or other product safety or labeling claims could adversely affect our business reputation and financial performance 

  

all of our vendors and their products must comply with applicable product safety laws and regulations including those relating to product labeling and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all applicable safety and labeling standards however product liability personal injury or other claims may be asserted against us relating to product contamination product tampering product expiration mislabeling recall and other safety or labeling issues with respect to the products that we sell 

  

we seek but may not be successful in obtaining contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from our vendors if we do not have adequate contractual indemnification or insurance available such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations our ability to obtain indemnification from foreign vendors may be hindered by our ability to obtain jurisdiction over such vendors to enforce contractual indemnification obligations even with adequate insurance and indemnification such claims could significantly damage our reputation and consumer confidence in our products our litigation expenses could increase as well which also could have a materially negative impact on our results of operations even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued 

  

 

our private brands may not be successful in improving our gross profit rate and may increase certain of the risks we face 

  

the sale of private brand items is an important component of our sales growth and gross profit rate enhancement plans we have invested in our development and procurement resources and marketing efforts relating to these private brand offerings we believe that our success in maintaining broad market acceptance of our private brands depends on many factors including pricing our costs quality customer perception and the timely development and introduction of new products we may not achieve or maintain our expected sales for our private brands the sale and expansion of our private brand offerings also subjects us to certain risks such as potential product liability risks and mandatory or voluntary product recalls potential supply chain and distribution chain disruptions for raw materials and finished products our ability to successfully protect our proprietary rights and successfully navigate and avoid claims related to the proprietary rights of third parties our ability to successfully administer and comply with applicable contractual obligations and legal and regulatory requirements and other risks generally encountered by entities that source sell and market exclusive branded offerings for retail an increase in sales of our private brands may also adversely affect sales of our vendors’ products which in turn could adversely affect our relationship with certain of our vendors any failure to appropriately address some or all of these risks could have a significant adverse effect on our private brand initiatives and on our reputation business results of operations and financial condition 

  

we are subject to governmental regulations procedures and requirements a significant change in or noncompliance with these regulations could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance 

  

our business is subject to numerous and frequently changing federal state and local laws and regulations we routinely incur significant costs in complying with these regulations the complexity of the regulatory environment in which we operate and the related cost of compliance are increasing due to additional legal and regulatory requirements our expanding operations and increased enforcement efforts further uncertainties exist regarding the future application of certain of these legal requirements to our business new laws regulations policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices particularly those dealing with environmental compliance product safety or labeling food safety information security and privacy and labor and employment among others or changes in existing laws regulations policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices particularly those governing the sale of products or employee wages may result in significant added expenses or may require extensive system and operating changes that may be difficult to implement andor could materially increase our cost of doing business untimely compliance or noncompliance with applicable regulations or untimely or incomplete execution of a required product recall can result in the imposition of penalties including loss of licenses eligibility to accept certain government benefits such as snap or significant fines or monetary penalties class action litigation or other litigation in addition to reputational damage additionally changes in tax laws the interpretation of existing laws or our failure to sustain our reporting positions on examination could adversely affect our overall effective tax rate 

  

litigation may adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

our business is subject to the risk of litigation by employees consumers suppliers competitors shareholders government agencies and others through private actions class actions administrative proceedings regulatory actions or other litigation the outcome of litigation particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions is difficult to assess or quantify plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to these lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time in addition certain of these lawsuits if decided adversely to us or settled by us may result in liability material to our financial statements as a whole or may negatively affect our operating results if changes to our business operations are required the cost to defend future litigation may be significant there also may be adverse publicity associated with litigation that could negatively affect customer perception of our business regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable as a result litigation may adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding certain of these pending matters 

  

 

our current insurance program may expose us to unexpected costs and negatively affect our financial performance 

  

our insurance coverage reflects deductibles selfinsured retentions limits of liability and similar provisions that we believe are prudent based on the dispersion of our operations however there are types of losses we may incur but against which we cannot be insured or which we believe are not economically reasonable to insure such as losses due to acts of war employee and certain other crime certain wage and hour and other employmentrelated claims including class actions actions based on certain consumer protection laws and some natural and other disasters or similar events if we incur these losses and they are material our business could suffer certain material events may result in sizable losses for the insurance industry and adversely impact the availability of adequate insurance coverage or result in excessive premium increases to offset negative insurance market trends we may elect to selfinsure accept higher deductibles or reduce the amount of coverage in response to these market changes in addition we selfinsure a significant portion of expected losses under our workers’ compensation automobile liability general liability including claims made against certain of our landlords and group health insurance programs unanticipated changes in any applicable actuarial assumptions and management estimates underlying our recorded liabilities for these losses including expected increases in medical and indemnity costs could result in materially different expenses than expected under these programs which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition although we continue to maintain property insurance for catastrophic events at our store support center and distribution centers we are effectively selfinsured for other property losses if we experience a greater number of these losses than we anticipate our financial performance could be adversely affected 

  

natural disasters and unusual weather conditions whether or not caused by climate change pandemic outbreaks terrorist acts and global political events could disrupt business and result in lower sales and otherwise adversely affect our financial performance 

  

the occurrence of one or more natural disasters such as hurricanes fires floods tornadoes and earthquakes unusual weather conditions pandemic outbreaks terrorist acts or disruptive global political events such as civil unrest in countries in which our suppliers are located or similar disruptions could adversely affect our business and financial performance uncharacteristic or significant weather conditions can affect consumer shopping patterns which could lead to lost sales or greater than expected markdowns and adversely affect our shortterm results of operations to the extent these events result in the closure of one or more of our distribution centers a significant number of stores or our corporate headquarters or impact one or more of our key suppliers our operations and financial performance could be materially adversely affected through an inability to make deliveries or provide other support functions to our stores and through lost sales in addition these events could result in increases in fuel or other energy prices or a fuel shortage delays in opening new stores the temporary lack of an adequate work force in a market the temporary or longterm disruption in the supply of products from some domestic and overseas suppliers the temporary disruption in the transport of goods from overseas delay or increased transportation costs in the delivery of goods to our distribution centers or stores the inability of customers to reach or have transportation to our stores directly affected by such events the temporary reduction in the availability of products in our stores and disruption of our utility services or to our information systems these events also can have indirect consequences such as increases in the costs of insurance if they result in significant loss of property or other insurable damage 

  

material damage or interruptions to our information systems as a result of external factors staffing shortages or challenges or difficulties in maintaining or updating our existing technology or developing or implementing new technology could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 

  

we depend on a variety of information technology systems for the efficient functioning of our business including without limitation the processing of transactions and the management of our employees facilities logistics inventories stores and customerfacing digital operations we are continually improving our information processes and computer systems to better run our business these technology initiatives may not deliver desired results or may do so on a delayed schedule additionally such systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages facility damage computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses cybersecurity breaches cyber attacks including malicious codes worms phishing and denial of service attacks and 

 

ransomware software upgrade failures or code defects natural disasters and human error damage or interruption to or defects of design related to these systems may require a significant investment to fix or replace them and we may suffer interruptions or disruptions in our operations in the interim may experience loss or corruption of critical data and may receive negative publicity all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 

  

we also rely heavily on our information technology staff failure to meet these staffing needs may negatively affect our ability to fulfill our technology initiatives while continuing to provide maintenance on existing systems we rely on certain vendors and service providers to maintain and periodically upgrade many of these systems so that they can continue to support our business the software programs supporting many of our systems were licensed to us by independent software developers the inability of these vendors developers or us to continue to maintain and upgrade these information systems and software programs might disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations if we were unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner and could expose us to greater risk of a cybersecurity breach or other cyber attack in addition costs and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology or with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems could also disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations 

  

failure to attract train and retain qualified employees while controlling labor costs as well as other labor issues could adversely affect our financial performance 

  

our future growth and performance positive customer experience and regulatory compliance depends on our ability to attract train retain and motivate qualified employees many of whom are in positions with historically high rates of turnover our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling our labor costs is subject to many external factors including competition for and availability of qualified personnel in a given market unemployment levels within those markets wage rates within particular markets minimum wage laws health and other insurance costs changes in employment and labor laws including changes in the process for our employees to join a union or other workplace regulations including changes in employee benefit programs such as health insurance and paid leave programs employee activism and our reputation and relevance within the labor market if we are unable to attract and retain adequate numbers of qualified employees our operations customer service levels and support functions could suffer in addition to the extent a significant portion of our employee base unionizes or attempts to unionize our labor costs could increase our ability to pass along labor costs to our customers is constrained by our everyday low price model and we may not be able to offset such increased costs elsewhere in our business 

  

our success depends on our executive officers and other key personnel if we lose key personnel or are unable to hire additional qualified personnel our business may be harmed 

  

our future success depends to a significant degree on the skills experience and efforts of our executive officers and other key personnel the unexpected loss of the services of any of our executive officers could have an adverse effect on our operations there can be no assurance that our executive succession planning retention or hiring efforts will be successful competition for skilled and experienced management personnel is intense and our future success will also depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and a failure to attract and retain new qualified personnel could have an adverse effect on our operations 

  

because our business is somewhat seasonal adverse events during the fourth quarter could materially affect our financial statements as a whole 

  

primarily because of sales of christmasrelated merchandise our most profitable sales mix generally occurs in the fourth quarter in anticipation of this holiday we purchase substantial amounts of seasonal inventory adverse events such as deteriorating economic conditions high unemployment rates high gas prices public transportation disruptions or unusual or unanticipated adverse weather could result in lowerthanplanned sales during the christmas selling season which in turn could reduce our operating profit additionally an excess of seasonal merchandise inventory could result if our net sales during the christmas selling season fall below 

 

seasonal norms or expectations which could adversely affect our financial performance and operating results as a result of unanticipated markdowns 

  

deterioration in market conditions or changes in our credit profile could adversely affect our business operations and financial condition 

  

we rely on the positive cash flow we generate from our operating activities and our access to the credit and capital markets to fund our operations growth strategy and return of cash to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends changes in the credit and capital markets including market disruptions limited liquidity and interest rate fluctuations may increase the cost of financing or restrict our access to these potential sources of future liquidity our continued access to these liquidity sources on favorable terms depends on multiple factors including our operating performance and our credit ratings our debt securities currently have an investment grade rating and a downgrade of this rating likely would negatively impact our access to the debt capital markets and increase our cost of borrowing as a result any disruptions or turmoil in the debt markets or any downgrade of our credit ratings could adversely affect our business operations and financial condition and our ability to return cash to our shareholders there can be no assurances that our ability to obtain additional financing through the debt markets will not be adversely impacted by economic conditions or that we will be able to maintain or improve our current credit ratings 

  

new accounting guidance or changes in the interpretation or application of existing accounting guidance could adversely affect our financial performance 

  

the implementation of new accounting standards could require certain systems internal process and other changes that could increase our operating costs and also will result in changes to our financial statements in particular the implementation of accounting standards related to leases as issued by the financial accounting standards board “fasb” are requiring us to make significant changes to our lease management and other accounting systems and will result in a material impact to our consolidated financial statements additionally the fasb has issued accounting standards related to intraentity transfers that will result in changes to our financial statements 

  

us generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by our management changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments by our management could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance the outcome of such changes could include litigation or regulatory actions which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations

executive overview 

  

we are among the largest discount retailers in the united states by number of stores with 14609 stores located in 44 states as of march 2 2018 with the greatest concentration of stores in the southern southwestern midwestern and eastern united states we offer a broad selection of merchandise including consumable products such as food paper and cleaning products health and beauty products and pet supplies and nonconsumable products such as seasonal merchandise home decor and domestics and basic apparel our merchandise includes national brands from leading manufacturers as well as our own private brand selections with prices at substantial discounts to national brands we offer our customers these national brand and private brand products at everyday low prices typically 10 or less in our convenient smallbox locations 

  

because the customers we serve are valueconscious many with low or fixed incomes we are intensely focused on helping them make the most of their spending dollars we believe our convenient store formats locations and broad selection of highquality products at compelling values have driven our substantial growth and financial success over the years and through a variety of macroeconomic environments like other retailers we have been operating for several years in an environment with ongoing macroeconomic challenges and uncertainties our core customers are often among the first to be affected by negative or uncertain economic conditions and are among the last to feel the effects of improving economic conditions particularly when as in the recent past trends are inconsistent and their duration unknown the primary macroeconomic factors that affect our core customers include the unemployment rate the underemployment rate wage growth fuel prices and changes to certain government assistance programs such as the supplemental nutrition assistance program additionally our customers are impacted by increases in those expenses that generally comprise a large portion of their household budget such as rent and healthcare we believe that at various times the overall effect of the factors listed above has negatively affected our customer traffic and could do so in the future 

  

during 2017 we continued to make progress on certain strategic initiatives to pursue longterm growth opportunities such opportunities include leveraging existing and developing additional digital tools and technology to provide our customers with additional shopping access points and even greater convenience as well as an indepth analysis of and refreshed approach to our nonconsumables product offerings these growth initiatives will be ongoing priorities in 2018 while ensuring that we maintain our brand heritage and build upon our organizational capabilities 

  

we remain committed to the following longterm operating priorities as we consistently strive to improve our performance while retaining our customercentric focus 1 driving profitable sales growth 2 capturing growth opportunities 3 enhancing our position as a lowcost operator and 4 investing in our people as a competitive advantage 

  

we seek to drive profitable sales growth through initiatives aimed at increasing customer traffic and average transaction amount as well as an ongoing focus on enhancing our gross margins while maintaining both everyday low price and affordability 

  

historically our sales of consumables which tend to have lower gross margins have been the key drivers of net sales and customer traffic while sales of nonconsumables which tend to have higher gross margins have contributed to profitable sales growth and an increase in average transaction amount in addition throughout 2017 our sales mix continued to shift slightly toward consumables and within consumables slightly 

 

toward lower margin departments such as perishables and tobacco we expect the trends of consumables and lower margin consumables comprising an increasingly larger percentage of our sales than nonconsumables to continue throughout at least the beginning of 2018 certain of our initiatives including those related to the nonconsumables categories are intended to address these trends although there can be no assurance we will be successful in their reversal 

  

we believe samestore sales growth is key to achieving our financial objectives accordingly our initiatives are designed to increase customer traffic and average transaction amounts we made significant progress in 2017 on many of these initiatives which included the continued expansion of coolers the rollout of additional strategies across many of our merchandise departments including a redesign of our health and beauty department to drive further product awareness and market share a continued focus on improving our instock position and the addition of a queue line containing items intended to drive impulse purchases in a portion of our existing store base in 2018 we plan to continue expanding the cooler count as well as to launch a second phase of the health and beauty initiative additionally we plan to implement a redesign of the snack and beverage aisle to enhance customer awareness particularly in immediate consumption items we also plan to test an expanded assortment of “betterforyou” food choices across a select group of stores in nonconsumables the planned introduction of new and expanded product classes will provide increased opportunities for our customers to take advantage of our value and convenience offering many of these initiatives support our plans to continue investing in our existing store base with a goal to drive increased customer traffic and average transaction amount and as a result our samestore sales 

  

we demonstrate our commitment to the affordability needs of our core customer as more than 80 of our stockkeeping units were priced at 5 or less at the end of 2017 even as we work to provide everyday low prices and meet our customers’ affordability needs we also remain focused on enhancing our margins through effective category management inventory shrink reduction initiatives private brands penetration distribution and transportation efficiencies global sourcing and pricing and markdown optimization with respect to category management we strive to maintain an appropriate mix of consumables and nonconsumables sales because as noted above the mix of sales affects profitability due to the varying gross margins between and even within the consumables and nonconsumables categories we believe expanded and improved private brand offerings in 2018 will provide increased value offerings for our customers in addition to improving the profitability of certain product categories to support our efforts to reduce inventory shrink in 2018 we expect to continue to implement instore defensive merchandising and technologybased tools including a significant increase in the number of stores utilizing electronic article surveillance “eas” as the results from stores in which eas has been implemented suggest these measures help reduce shrink and improve our instock position increasing carrier and fuel rates pressured our overall gross margin in the latter half of 2017 and we anticipate that these negative impacts will continue into and throughout 2018 however we continue to seek to reduce our stem miles and optimize shipment loads to improve distribution and transportation efficiencies 

  

to support our other operating priorities we remain focused on capturing growth opportunities in 2017 we opened 1315 new stores along with remodeling or relocating 764 stores for 2018 we plan to open approximately 900 new stores remodel approximately 1000 mature store locations and relocate approximately 100 stores for an approximate total of 2000 real estate projects 

  

we continue to innovate within our channel and are able to utilize the most productive of our various store formats based on the specific market opportunity we expect that our traditional 7300 square foot store format will continue to be the primary store layout for new stores relocations and remodels in 2018 we expect a significant number of the planned 1000 remodels in 2018 to include a greater cooler count for increased selection of perishable items in addition our smaller format store less than 6000 square feet allows us to capture growth opportunities in metropolitan areas as well as in rural areas with a low number of households we continue to incorporate into our existing store base lessons learned from our various store formats and layouts with a goal of driving increased customer traffic average transaction amount samestore sales and overall store productivity 

  

 

to support our new store growth and drive productivity we continue to make investments in our distribution center network our fifteenth distribution center in jackson georgia began shipping in october 2017 we began construction on our sixteenth and seventeenth distribution centers in longview texas and amsterdam new york respectively in 2017 to continue to support our growth we expect both of these distribution centers to open in 2019 

  

we have established a position as a lowcost operator continuously seeking ways to reduce or control costs that do not affect our customers’ shopping experience we plan to continue enhancing this position over time as we aim to continually streamline our business while also employing ongoing cost discipline to reduce certain expenses as a percentage of sales although we did not leverage selling general  administrative “sga” expenses in 2017 as discussed in more detail below it was largely because of specific planned investments such as store manager pay and training and the increased store openings in the second half of the year both of which will pressure sga comparisons in the first half of 2018 

  

in 2017 we installed led lighting in a significant number of stores which reduces utilities and maintenance costs across our store base in addition to fostering a more customer and environmentally friendly shopping experience we anticipate the remaining stores in the chain that are eligible for our led lighting program will be completed in 2018 over the long term we believe actions such as these will support our goal of leveraging sga expenses at a lower same store sales growth percentage in addition we remain committed to simplifying or eliminating storelevel tasks and processes so that those time savings can be reinvested by our store managers and their teams in important areas such as enhanced customer service higher instock levels and improved store standards 

  

our employees are a competitive advantage and we are always searching for ways to continue investing in them we invest in our employees in an effort to create an environment that attracts and retains talented personnel as we believe that particularly at the store level employees who are promoted from within our company generally have longer tenures and are greater contributors to improvements in our financial performance our store managers play an important role in our customer experience and individual store profitability and beginning in march 2017 we implemented certain investments in compensation and training for this position in the form of increased sga expenses that we believe have already contributed to improved customer experience scores higher sales and improved turnover metrics 

  

to further enhance shareholder return we continued to repurchase shares of our common stock and paid quarterly cash dividends throughout 2017 in 2018 we intend to continue our share repurchase activity at a significantly greater dollar amount than in 2017 and to pay quarterly cash dividends subject to board discretion and approval 

  

on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act the “act” was signed into law among other impacts the act reduces the federal corporate tax rate to 21 from 35 effective january 1 2018 the act reduced our effective tax rate in 2017 primarily as a result of the onetime remeasurement of the federal portion of our deferred tax assets and liabilities to a lower rate accompanied by a reduction in the current year federal corporate tax rate to 337 due to our fiscal year ending approximately one month after the effective date of the act the act will have a positive material impact on our effective tax rate in 2018 and subsequent years 

  

a continued focus on our four operating priorities as discussed above coupled with strong cash flow management and share repurchases resulted in solid overall operating and financial performance in 2017 as compared to 2016 as set forth below basis points as referred to below are equal to 001 as a percentage of net sales

results of operations 

  

accounting periods the following text contains references to years 2017 2016 and 2015 which represent fiscal years ended february 2 2018 february 3 2017 and january 29 2016 respectively our fiscal year ends on the friday closest to january 31 fiscal year 2016 was a 53week accounting period and fiscal years 2017 and 2015 were 52week accounting periods 

  

seasonality  the nature of our business is somewhat seasonal primarily because of sales of christmasrelated merchandise operating profit in our fourth quarter november december and january has historically been higher than operating profit achieved in each of the first three quarters of the fiscal year expenses and to a greater extent operating profit vary by quarter results of a period shorter than a full year may not be indicative of results expected for the entire year furthermore the seasonal nature of our business may affect comparisons between periods 

  

 

the following table contains results of operations data for fiscal years 2017 2016 and 2015 and the dollar and percentage variances among those years 

  



  

net sales  the net sales increase in 2017 reflects a samestore sales increase of 27 compared to 2016 samestores include stores that have been open for at least 13 months and remain open at the end of the reporting period changes in samestore sales are calculated based on the comparable calendar weeks in the prior year and include stores that have been remodeled expanded or relocated in 2017 our 13150 samestores accounted for sales of 219 billion the increase in samestore sales was due to increases in average transaction amount and customer traffic relative to 2016 samestore sales in 2017 increased in the consumables and seasonal categories and declined in the home products and apparel categories compared to 2016 samestore sales results in 2017 for the three nonconsumables categories when aggregated were positive net sales for the 53 rd week of 2016 totaled 3987 million the 2017 net sales increase was positively affected by new stores modestly offset by sales from closed stores 

  

the net sales increase in 2016 reflects a samestore sales increase of 09 compared to 2015 primarily due to an increase in average transaction amount accompanied by customer traffic that was essentially unchanged as compared to the prior year for 2016 there were 12383 samestores which accounted for sales of 203 billion samestore sales results in 2016 reflect positive results in the consumables and home products categories partially offset by negative results in the apparel and seasonal categories compared to 2015 the remainder of the 2016 net sales increase was attributable to new stores partially offset by sales from closed stores 

  

 

of our four major merchandise categories the consumables category which generally has a lower gross profit rate than the other three categories has grown most significantly over the past several years because of the impact of sales mix on gross profit we continually review our merchandise mix and strive to adjust it when appropriate 

  

gross profit for 2017 gross profit increased by 65 and as a percentage of net sales decreased by 8 basis points to 308 compared to 2016 a greater proportion of sales of consumables which generally have a lower gross profit rate than our other product categories and sales of lower margin products comprising a higher proportion of consumables sales reduced the gross profit rate higher markdowns which were primarily for promotional activities and increases in transportation costs also reduced the gross profit rate and these factors were partially offset by higher initial markups on inventory purchases and an improved rate of inventory shrinkage 

  

for 2016 gross profit increased by 76 and as a percentage of net sales decreased by 11 basis points to 308 compared to 2015 the gross profit rate decrease in 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily reflects increased markdowns which were driven by promotional and inventory clearance activity sales of lowermargin consumables comprising a greater proportion of net sales and increased inventory shrink partially offset by higher initial inventory markups and lower transportation costs 

  

sga sga as a percentage of sales was 222 in 2017 compared to 215 in 2016 an increase of 75 basis points the 2017 results reflect increased retail labor expenses which includes our investment in store manager compensation increased occupancy costs and higher incentive compensation each of which increased at a rate greater than the increase in net sales partially offsetting these increased expenses were reduced advertising costs and costs that increased at a rate less than the increase in net sales including utilities and waste management costs primarily resulting from our recycling efforts the 2017 results include costs of 240 million related to 35 underperforming stores closed prior to the end of the year primarily expenses for remaining lease liabilities the 2017 results also reflect an increase in hurricane and other disasterrelated expenses of approximately 180 million compared to 2016 sga as a percentage of sales was favorably impacted in 2016 by increased sales including the 53 rd week discussed above among other factors 

  

sga was 215 as a percentage of net sales in 2016 increasing by 3 basis points over 2015 the 2016 results reflect increases in retail labor costs which increased at a rate greater than the increase in net sales partially offset by reductions in administrative payroll costs incentive compensation expenses and advertising costs the 2016 results also reflect an increase in hurricane and other disasterrelated expenses of 122 million over the comparable 2015 amounts 

  

interest expense  interest expense decreased 08 million to 970 million in 2017 compared to 2016 interest expense increased 109 million to 978 million in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to an increase in average debt outstanding and higher average interest rates see the detailed discussion under “liquidity and capital resources” regarding the financing of various longterm obligations 

  

we had consolidated outstanding variablerate debt of 6125 million and 9243 million as of february 2 2018 and february 3 2017 respectively the remainder of our outstanding indebtedness at february 2 2018 and february 3 2017 was fixed rate debt 

  

other income expense  other income expense in 2017 reflects expenses associated with the issuance and refinancing of longterm debt during the first quarter of 2017 

  

income taxes  the effective income tax rates for 2017 2016 and 2015 were expenses of 193 363 and 371 respectively 

  

under accounting standards for income taxes the impact of new tax legislation must be taken into account in the period in which the new legislation is enacted including the remeasurement of deferred tax assets 

 

and liabilities at the tax rates at which such items are expected to reverse in future periods subsequent to the signing of the act the securities and exchange commission staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 which allows companies to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year after the enactment date while the accounting impact is still under analysis our 2017 provision for income taxes reflects such estimates due to the changes in income tax law including a provisional tax benefit of 335 million the provisional tax benefit consists of 3108 million related to the onetime remeasurement of the federal portion of our deferred tax assets and liabilities at the 21 rate and 242 million related to the reduced statutory tax rate of 337 compared to 35 in prior years the ultimate impact may differ from these provisional amounts due to additional analysis changes in interpretations and assumptions we have made additional regulatory guidance that may be issued and actions we may take as a result of the act any subsequent adjustments to provisional estimates will be reflected in our income tax provision during one or more periods in 2018 

  

the effective income tax rate for 2017 was 193 compared to a rate of 363 for 2016 which represents a net decrease of 170 percentage points the effective income tax rate was lower in 2017 primarily due to the onetime remeasurement of the federal portions of our deferred tax assets and liabilities at 21 accompanied by the changes in the federal income tax laws pursuant to the act that lowered our statutory federal tax rate to 337 for the 2017 fiscal year compared to 35 in 2016 

  

the effective income tax rate for 2016 was 363 compared to a rate of 371 for 2015 which represents a net decrease of 08 percentage points the effective income tax rate was lower in 2016 due principally to the early adoption of a change in accounting guidance related to employee sharebased payments requiring the recognition of excess tax benefits in the statement of income rather than in the balance sheet as reported in prior years 

  

off balance sheet arrangements 

  

we are not party to any material off balance sheet arrangements 

  

effects of inflation 

  

in 2016 we experienced product cost deflation reflecting reductions in commodity costs primarily related to food products we experienced minimal overall commodity cost inflation or deflation in 2017 and 2015 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

current financial condition and recent developments 

  

during the past three years we have generated an aggregate of approximately 48 billion in cash flows from operating activities and incurred approximately 17 billion in capital expenditures during that period we expanded the number of stores we operate by 2745 representing growth of approximately 23 and we remodeled or relocated 2551 stores or approximately 22 of the stores we operated as of the beginning of the period in 2018 we intend to continue our current strategy of pursuing store growth remodels and relocations 

  

at february 2 2018 we had a 14 billion unsecured credit agreement the “facilities” 24 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes and a commercial paper program that may provide borrowing availability of up to 10 billion at february 2 2018 we had total outstanding debt including the current portion of longterm obligations of 30 billion which includes balances under the term facility as defined below commercial paper and senior notes all of which are described in greater detail below our borrowing availability under the unsecured credit agreement may be effectively limited by borrowings under the commercial paper program as further described below the information contained in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii item 8 of this report is incorporated herein by reference 

  

 

we believe our cash flow from operations including anticipated increases resulting from the act and our existing cash balances combined with availability under the facilities as defined below the commercial paper program and access to the debt markets will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our current obligations projected working capital requirements capital spending and anticipated dividend payments for a period that includes the next twelve months as well as the next several years however our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity may be affected by numerous factors many of which are outside of our control depending on our liquidity levels conditions in the capital markets and other factors we may from time to time consider the issuance of debt equity or other securities the proceeds of which could provide additional liquidity for our operations 

  

for fiscal 2018 we anticipate potential borrowings under the unsecured revolving credit facility described below and our commercial paper program to be a maximum of approximately 800 million outstanding at any one time including any anticipated borrowings to fund repurchases of common stock 

  

credit facilities 

  

on february 22 2017 we entered into the facilities which consist of a 1750 million senior unsecured term loan facility the “term facility” and a 125 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility the “revolving facility” of which up to 1750 million is available for the issuance of letters of credit the term facility is scheduled to mature on october 20 2020 and the revolving facility is scheduled to mature on february 22 2022 

  

borrowings under the facilities bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable interest rate margin plus at our option either a libor or b a base rate which is usually equal to the prime rate the applicable interest rate margin for borrowings as of february 2 2018 was 110 for libor borrowings and 010 for baserate borrowings we must also pay a facility fee payable on any used and unused commitment amounts of the facilities and customary fees on letters of credit issued under the revolving facility as of february 2 2018 the commitment fee rate was 015 the applicable interest rate margins for borrowings the facility fees and the letter of credit fees under the facilities are subject to adjustment from time to time based on our longterm senior unsecured debt ratings the weighted average allin interest rate for borrowings under the facilities was 27 as of february 2 2018 

  

the facilities can be voluntarily prepaid in whole or in part at any time without penalty there is no required principal amortization under the facilities the facilities contain a number of customary affirmative and negative covenants that among other things restrict subject to certain exceptions our including our subsidiaries’ ability to incur additional liens sell all or substantially all of our assets consummate certain fundamental changes or change in our lines of business and incur additional subsidiary indebtedness the facilities also contain financial covenants that require the maintenance of a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio as of february 2 2018 we were in compliance with all such covenants the facilities also contain customary events of default 

  

as of february 2 2018 the entire balance of the term facility was outstanding and under the revolving facility we had no outstanding borrowings outstanding letters of credit of 91 million and borrowing availability of 12 billion that due to our intention to maintain borrowing availability related to the commercial paper program described below could contribute incremental liquidity of 6247 million at february 2 2018 in addition as of february 2 2018 we had outstanding letters of credit of 375 million which were issued pursuant to separate agreements 

  

commercial paper 

  

as of february 2 2018 we had outstanding unsecured commercial paper notes the “cp notes” of 6162 million 186 million of which were held by a whollyowned subsidiary the consolidated balance of 4302 million was classified as longterm obligations on the consolidated balance sheet due to our intent and ability to refinance these obligations as longterm debt under this program we may issue the cp notes from time 

 

to time in an aggregate amount not to exceed 10 billion outstanding at any time the cp notes may have maturities of up to 364 days from the date of issue and rank equal in right of payment with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness we intend to maintain available commitments under the revolving facility in an amount at least equal to the amount of cp notes outstanding at any time as of february 2 2018 the outstanding cp notes had a weighted average borrowing rate of 18 

  

senior notes 

  

in april 2013 we issued 4000 million aggregate principal amount of 1875 senior notes due 2018 the “2018 senior notes” at a discount of 05 million which are scheduled to mature on april 15 2018 and 9000 million aggregate principal amount of 325 senior notes due 2023 the “2023 senior notes” at a discount of 24 million which are scheduled to mature on april 15 2023 in october 2015 we issued 5000 million aggregate principal amount of 4150 senior notes due 2025 the “2025 senior notes” at a discount of 08 million which are scheduled to mature on november 1 2025 in april 2017 we issued 6000 million aggregate principal amount of 3875 senior notes due 2027 the “2027 senior notes” at a discount of 04 million which are scheduled to mature on april 15 2027 collectively the 2018 senior notes the 2023 senior notes 2025 senior notes and 2027 senior notes comprise the “senior notes” each of which were issued pursuant to an indenture as supplemented and amended by supplemental indentures relating to each series of senior notes as so supplemented and amended the “senior indenture” interest on the 2018 senior notes the 2023 senior notes and the 2027 senior notes is payable in cash on april 15 and october 15 of each year interest on the 2025 senior notes is payable in cash on may 1 and november 1 of each year we expect to refinance the 2018 senior notes on or prior to their maturity utilizing proceeds from the issuance of additional senior notes revolver borrowings or the issuance of commercial paper 

  

we may redeem some or all of the senior notes at any time at redemption prices set forth in the senior indenture upon the occurrence of a change of control triggering event which is defined in the senior indenture each holder of our senior notes has the right to require us to repurchase some or all of such holder’s senior notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101 of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest if any to but excluding the repurchase date 

  

the senior indenture contains covenants limiting among other things our ability subject to certain exceptions to consolidate merge or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets and our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur or guarantee indebtedness secured by liens on any shares of voting stock of significant subsidiaries 

  

the senior indenture also provides for events of default which if any of them occurs would permit or require the principal of and accrued interest on our senior notes to become or to be declared due and payable as applicable 

  

rating agencies 

  

our senior unsecured debt is rated “baa2” by moody’s with a stable outlook and “bbb” by standard  poor’s with a stable outlook and our commercial paper program is rated “p2” by moody’s and “a2” by standard and poor’s our current credit ratings as well as future rating agency actions could i impact our ability to finance our operations on satisfactory terms ii affect our financing costs and iii affect our insurance premiums and collateral requirements necessary for our selfinsured programs there can be no assurance that we will maintain or improve our current credit ratings 

  

 

contractual obligations 

  

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of february 2 2018 in thousands 

  



  





  



  



  



  



  



  

share repurchase program 

  

our existing common stock repurchase program had a total remaining authorization of approximately 354 million at february 2 2018 our board of directors increased by 10 billion the authorization available under this common stock repurchase program on march 14 2018 under the authorization purchases may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time subject to market and other 

 

conditions the authorization has no expiration date and may be modified or terminated from time to time at the discretion of our board of directors for more detail about our share repurchase program see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

other considerations 

  

on march 14 2018 the board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 029 per share which is payable on or before april 24 2018 to shareholders of record of our common stock on april 10 2018 we paid quarterly cash dividends of 026 per share in 2017 although the board currently expects to continue regular quarterly cash dividends the declaration and amount of future cash dividends are subject to the board’s sole discretion and will depend upon among other factors our results of operations cash requirements financial condition contractual restrictions and other factors that our board may deem relevant in its sole discretion 

  

our inventory balance represented approximately 52 of our total assets exclusive of goodwill and other intangible assets as of february 2 2018 our ability to effectively manage our inventory balances can have a significant impact on our cash flows from operations during a given fiscal year inventory purchases are often somewhat seasonal in nature such as the purchase of warmweather or christmasrelated merchandise efficient management of our inventory has been and continues to be an area of focus for us 

  

as described in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements we are involved in a number of legal actions and claims some of which could potentially result in material cash payments adverse developments in those actions could materially and adversely affect our liquidity we also have certain income taxrelated contingencies as disclosed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements future negative developments could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity 

  

cash flows 

  

cash flows from operating activities cash flows from operating activities were 18 billion in 2017 which represents a 1971 million increase compared to 2016 net income increased by 2878 million in 2017 over 2016 offset by changes in merchandise inventories which resulted in a 3484 million decrease in 2017 as compared to a decrease of 1719 million in 2016 changes in accounts payable resulted in a 4279 million increase in 2017 compared to a 565 million increase in 2016 due primarily to the timing of receipts and payments which was partially impacted by certain changes in payment terms 

  

cash flows from operating activities were 16 billion in 2016 an increase of 2134 million compared to 2015 significant components of the increase in cash flows from operating activities in 2016 compared to 2015 include increased net income due primarily to increased sales and operating profit in 2016 as described in more detail above under “results of operations” changes in merchandise inventories resulted in a reduction in working capital usage in 2016 compared to 2015 as described in greater detail below accounts payable increased by 565 million in 2016 compared to a 1056 million increase in 2015 due primarily to the timing of merchandise receipts and related payments which were impacted by certain changes in payment terms 

  

on an ongoing basis we closely monitor and manage our inventory balances and they may fluctuate from period to period based on new store openings the timing of purchases and other factors merchandise inventories increased by 11 in 2017 by 6 in 2016 and by 10 in 2015 inventory levels in the consumables category increased by 3229 million or 16 in 2017 by 545 million or 3 in 2016 and by 2184 million or 13 in 2015 the seasonal category increased by 149 million or 2 in 2017 by 795 million or 15 in 2016 and by 632 million or 13 in 2015 the home products category increased by 106 million or 3 in 2017 by 408 million or 14 in 2016 and by 128 million or 5 in 2015 the apparel category increased by 19 million or 1 in 2017 increased by 99 million or 3 in 2016 and decreased by 27 million or 1 in 2015

significant components of property and equipment purchases in 2016 included the following approximate amounts 201 million for distribution and transportationrelated projects 168 million for improvements upgrades remodels and relocations of existing stores 120 million for new leased stores 38 million for stores purchased or built by us and 26 million for information systems upgrades and technologyrelated projects during 2016 we opened 900 new stores and remodeled or relocated 906 stores

capital expenditures during 2018 are projected to be in the range of 725 to 800 million we anticipate funding 2018 capital requirements with a combination of some or all of the following existing cash balances cash flows from operations availability under our revolving facility andor the issuance of additional senior notes or cp notes we plan to continue to invest in store growth and development of approximately 900 new stores and approximately 1100 stores to be remodeled or relocated capital expenditures in 2018 are anticipated to support our store growth as well as our remodel and relocation initiatives including capital outlays for leasehold improvements fixtures and equipment the construction of new stores costs to support and enhance our supply chain initiatives including new and existing distribution center facilities and our private fleet technology initiatives as well as routine and ongoing capital requirements 

  

cash flows from financing activities  in 2017 we had net proceeds from the issuance of the 2027 senior notes of 5996 million we redeemed the 2017 senior notes for 5000 million and made a principal payment on the term facility of 2500 million we had a net decrease in consolidated commercial paper borrowings in 2017 of 603 million and had no borrowings or repayments under the revolving facility we repurchased 71 million outstanding shares of our common stock in 2017 at a total cost of 5797 million and paid cash dividends of 2829 million

accounting standards 

  

in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued comprehensive new accounting standards related to the recognition of revenue which specified an effective date for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2016 with early adoption not permitted in august 2015 the fasb deferred the effective date to annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 with earlier adoption permitted only for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2016 the new guidance allows 

 

companies to use either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach in the adoption of this guidance we formed a project team to assess and implement the standard by compiling a list of the applicable revenue streams evaluating relevant contracts and comparing our current accounting policies to the new standard as a result of the efforts of this project team we identified customer incentives and gross versus net considerations as the areas in which we would most likely be affected by the new guidance we have assessed the impacts of the new standard and the related design of internal control over financial reporting based upon the terms of our agreements and the materiality of our transactions related to customer incentives and gross versus net considerations the adoption had no effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows we adopted this guidance on february 3 2018 

  

in february 2016 the fasb issued new guidance related to lease accounting which when effective will require a dual approach for lessee accounting under which a lessee will account for leases as finance leases or operating leases both finance leases and operating leases will result in the lessee recognizing a rightofuse asset and a corresponding lease liability on its balance sheet with differing methodology for income statement recognition this guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2018 and early adoption is permitted currently a modified retrospective approach is required for all leases existing or entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the consolidated financial statements the fasb has proposed guidance which would allow companies to record the cumulative effect of applying the new standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings although such guidance has not yet been formally issued we formed a project team to assess and implement the standard which is evaluating existing contractual arrangements for embedded leases and comparing our current accounting policies to the new standard as a result of the efforts of this project team we have identified store leases as the area in which we would most likely be affected by the new guidance our assessment of the impact that adoption of this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements is ongoing and we are anticipating a material impact because we are party to a significant number of lease contracts for our stores 

  

in october 2016 the fasb issued amendments to existing guidance related to accounting for intraentity transfers of assets other than inventory these amendments require an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of such transfers when the transfer occurs and affects our historical accounting for intraentity transfers of certain intangible assets this guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2017 and early adoption is permitted subject to certain guidelines the amendments should be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulativeeffect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption we adopted this guidance on february 3 2018 which will result in an increase in deferred income tax liabilities and a decrease in retained earnings of approximately 336 million in the first quarter of 2018 

  

in january 2017 the fasb issued amendments to existing guidance related to the subsequent measurement of goodwill these amendments modify the concept of impairment from the condition that exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value to the condition that exists when the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value subsequent to adoption an entity will perform its annual or interim goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value this guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2019 and early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after january 1 2017 the amendments should be applied on a prospective basis an entity is required to disclose the nature of and reason for the change in accounting principle upon transition our assessment of the impact that adoption of this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements is ongoing but we do not anticipate a material effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “us gaap” requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures in addition to the estimates presented below there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed critical as defined below we believe these estimates are reasonable and appropriate however if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used the resulting changes could have a material effect on the financial statements taken as a whole 

  

management believes the following policies and estimates are critical because they involve significant judgments assumptions and estimates management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosures presented below relating to those policies and estimates see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of our principal accounting policies 

  

merchandise inventories  merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market “lcm” with cost determined using the retail last in first out “lifo” method we use the retail inventory method “rim” to calculate gross profit and the resulting valuation of inventories at cost which are computed utilizing a calculated costtoretail inventory ratio at an inventory department level we apply the rim to these departments which are groups of products that are fairly uniform in terms of cost selling price relationship and turnover the rim will result in valuing inventories at lcm if permanent markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories inherent in the retail inventory method calculation are certain management judgments and estimates that may impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the gross profit recognized these judgments include ensuring departments consist of similar products recording estimated shrinkage between physical inventories and timely recording of markdowns needed to sell inventory 

  

we perform an annual lifo analysis whereby all merchandise units are considered for inclusion in the index formulation an actual valuation of inventory under the lifo method is made at the end of each year based on the inventory levels and costs at that time in contrast interim lifo calculations are based on management’s annual estimates of sales the rate of inflation or deflation and yearend inventory levels we also perform analyses for determining obsolete inventory adjusting inventory on a quarterly basis to an lcm value based on various management assumptions including estimated below cost markdowns not yet recorded but required to liquidate such inventory in future periods 

  

factors considered in the determination of markdowns include current and anticipated demand based on changes in competitors’ practices consumer preferences consumer spending and unseasonable weather patterns certain of these factors are outside of our control and may result in greater than estimated markdowns to entice consumer purchases of excess inventory the amount and timing of markdowns may vary significantly from year to year 

  

we perform physical inventories in virtually all of our stores on an annual basis we calculate our shrink provision based on actual physical inventory results during the fiscal period and an accrual for estimated shrink occurring subsequent to a physical inventory through the end of the fiscal reporting period this accrual is calculated as a percentage of sales at each retail store at a department level based on the store’s most recent historical shrink rate to the extent that subsequent physical inventories yield different results than the estimated accrual our effective shrink rate for a given reporting period will include the impact of adjusting to the actual results 

  

we believe our estimates and assumptions related to the application of the rim results in a merchandise inventory valuation that reasonably approximates cost on a consistent basis 

  

 

goodwill and other intangible assets the qualitative and quantitative assessments related to the valuation and any potential impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets are each subject to judgments andor assumptions the analysis of qualitative factors may include determining the appropriate factors to consider and the relative importance of those factors along with other assumptions if required judgments in the quantitative testing process may include projecting future cash flows determining appropriate discount rates correctly applying valuation techniques correctly computing the implied fair value of goodwill if necessary and other assumptions future cash flow projections are based on management’s projections and represent best estimates taking into account recent financial performance market trends strategic plans and other available information which in recent years have been materially accurate changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value or impairment however such a conclusion is not indicated by recent analyses future indicators of impairment could result in an asset impairment charge if these judgments or assumptions are incorrect or flawed the analysis could be negatively impacted 

  

our most recent evaluation of our goodwill and indefinite lived trade name intangible assets was completed during the third quarter of 2017 no indicators of impairment were evident and no assessment of or adjustment to these assets was required we are not currently projecting a decline in cash flows that could be expected to have an adverse effect such as a violation of debt covenants or future impairment charges 

  

property and equipment  property and equipment are recorded at cost we group our assets into relatively homogeneous classes and generally provide for depreciation on a straightline basis over the estimated average useful life of each asset class except for leasehold improvements which are amortized over the lesser of the applicable lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset certain store and warehouse fixtures when fully depreciated are removed from the cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization accounts the valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of depreciable lives involves judgments and the use of estimates which we believe have been materially accurate in recent years 

  

impairment of longlived assets impairment of longlived assets results when the carrying value of the assets exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows generated by the assets our estimate of undiscounted future store cash flows is based upon historical operations of the stores and estimates of future profitability which encompasses many factors that are subject to variability and are difficult to predict if our estimates of future cash flows are not materially accurate our impairment analysis could be impacted accordingly if a longlived asset is found to be impaired the amount recognized for impairment is equal to the difference between the carrying value and the asset’s estimated fair value the fair value is estimated based primarily upon projected future cash flows discounted at our credit adjusted riskfree rate or other reasonable estimates of fair market value although not currently anticipated changes in these estimates assumptions or projections could materially affect the determination of fair value or impairment 

  

insurance liabilities  we retain a significant portion of the risk for our workers’ compensation employee health general liability property loss automobile and thirdparty landlord claim exposures these represent significant costs primarily due to our large employee base and number of stores provisions are made for these liabilities on an undiscounted basis certain of these liabilities are based on actual claim data and estimates of incurred but not reported claims developed using actuarial methodologies based on historical claim trends which have been and are anticipated to continue to be materially accurate if future claim trends deviate from recent historical patterns or other unanticipated events affect the number and significance of future claims we may be required to record additional expenses or expense reductions which could be material to our future financial results 

  

contingent liabilities – income taxes income tax reserves are determined using the methodology established by accounting standards relating to uncertainty in income taxes these standards require companies to assess each income tax position taken using a twostep process a determination is first made as to whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained based upon the technical merits upon examination by the taxing authorities if the tax position is expected to meet the more likely than not criteria the benefit recorded for the tax position equals the largest amount that is greater than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement of 

 

the respective tax position uncertain tax positions require determinations and liabilities to be estimated based on provisions of the tax law which may be subject to change or varying interpretation if our determinations and estimates prove to be inaccurate the resulting adjustments could be material to our future financial results 

  

contingent liabilities  legal matters    we are subject to legal regulatory and other proceedings and claims we establish liabilities as appropriate for these claims and proceedings based upon the probability and estimability of losses and to fairly present in conjunction with the disclosures of these matters in our financial statements and sec filings management’s view of our exposure we review outstanding claims and proceedings with external counsel as needed to assess probability and estimates of loss which includes an analysis of whether such loss estimates are probable reasonably possible or remote we reevaluate these assessments on a quarterly basis or as new and significant information becomes available to determine whether a liability should be established or if any existing liability should be adjusted the actual cost of resolving a claim or proceeding ultimately may be substantially different than the amount of the recorded liability in addition because it is not permissible under us gaap to establish a litigation liability until the loss is both probable and estimable in some cases there may be insufficient time to establish a liability prior to the actual incurrence of the loss upon verdict and judgment at trial for example or in the case of a quickly negotiated settlement 

  

lease accounting and excess facilities  many of our stores are subject to buildtosuit arrangements with landlords which typically carry a primary lease term of up to 15 years with multiple renewal options we also have stores subject to shorterterm leases and many of these leases have renewal options certain of our stores have provisions for contingent rentals based upon a percentage of defined sales volume we recognize contingent rental expense when the achievement of specified sales targets is considered probable we record minimum rental expense on a straightline basis over the base noncancelable lease term commencing on the date that we take physical possession of the property from the landlord which normally includes a period prior to store opening to make necessary leasehold improvements and install store fixtures when a lease contains a predetermined fixed escalation of the minimum rent we recognize the related rent expense on a straightline basis and record the difference between the recognized rental expense and the amounts payable under the lease as deferred rent tenant allowances to the extent received are recorded as deferred incentive rent and amortized as a reduction to rent expense over the term of the lease we reflect as a liability any difference between the calculated expense and the amounts actually paid improvements of leased properties are amortized over the shorter of the life of the applicable lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset 

  

sharebased payments  our stock option awards are valued on an individual grant basis using the blackscholesmerton closed form option pricing model we believe that this model fairly estimates the value of our stock option awards the application of this valuation model involves assumptions that are judgmental in the valuation of stock options which affects compensation expense related to these options these assumptions include the term that the options are expected to be outstanding the historical volatility of our stock price applicable interest rates and the dividend yield of our stock other factors involving judgments that affect the expensing of sharebased payments include estimated forfeiture rates of sharebased awards historically these estimates have been materially accurate however if our estimates differ materially from actual experience we may be required to record additional expense or reductions of expense which could be material to our future financial results 

  

fair value measurements accounting standards for the measurement of fair value of assets and liabilities establish a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity observable inputs that are classified within levels 1 and 2 of the hierarchy and the reporting entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions unobservable inputs classified within level 3 of the hierarchy therefore level 3 inputs are typically based on an entity’s own assumptions as there is little if any related market activity and thus require the use of significant judgment and estimates currently we have no assets or liabilities that are valued based solely on level 3 inputs 

  

our fair value measurements are primarily associated with our outstanding debt instruments we use various valuation models in determining the values of these liabilities we believe that in recent years these methodologies have produced materially accurate valuations 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

financial risk management 

  

we are exposed to market risk primarily from adverse changes in interest rates and to a lesser degree commodity prices to minimize this risk we may periodically use financial instruments including derivatives all derivative financial instrument transactions must be authorized and executed pursuant to approval by the board of directors as a matter of policy we do not buy or sell financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes and any such derivative financial instruments are intended to be used to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure our objective is to correlate derivative financial instruments and the underlying exposure being hedged so that fluctuations in the value of the financial instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying economic exposure 

  

interest rate risk 

  

we manage our interest rate risk through the strategic use of fixed and variable interest rate debt and from time to time derivative financial instruments our principal interest rate exposure relates to outstanding amounts under our unsecured debt facilities as well as our commercial paper program as of february 2 2018 we had variable rate borrowings of 175 million under our term facility consolidated borrowings of 4302 million under our commercial paper program and no borrowings outstanding under our revolving facility in order to mitigate a portion of the variable rate interest exposure under the credit facilities in prior years we have entered into various interest rate swaps as of february 2 2018 no such interest rate swaps were outstanding and as a result we are exposed to fluctuations in variable interest rates under the credit facilities and our commercial paper program for a detailed discussion of our credit facilities and our commercial paper program see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

a change in interest rates on variable rate debt impacts our pretax earnings and cash flows whereas a change in interest rates on fixed rate debt impacts the economic fair value of debt but not our pretax earnings and cash flows based on our variable rate borrowing levels as of february 2 2018 and february 3 2017 the annualized effect of a one percentage point increase in variable interest rates would have resulted in a pretax reduction of our earnings and cash flows of approximately 61 million in 2017 and 92 million in 2016

general 

  

we are among the largest discount retailers in the united states by number of stores with 13429 stores located in 44 states as of march 3 2017 with the greatest concentration of stores in the southern southwestern midwestern and eastern united states we offer a broad selection of merchandise including consumables seasonal items home products and apparel our merchandise includes high quality national brands from leading manufacturers as well as our own value and comparable quality private brand selections with prices at substantial discounts to national brands we offer our merchandise at everyday low prices through our convenient smallbox locations 

  

our history 

  

jl turner founded our company in 1939 as jl turner and son wholesale we were incorporated as a kentucky corporation under the name jl turner  son inc in 1955 when we opened our first dollar general store we changed our name to dollar general corporation in 1968 and reincorporated in 1998 as a tennessee corporation our common stock was publicly traded from 1968 until july 2007 when we merged with an entity controlled by investment funds affiliated with kohlberg kravis roberts  co lp or kkr in november 2009 our common stock again became publicly traded and in december 2013 the entity controlled by investment funds affiliated with kkr sold its remaining shares of our common stock 

  

our business model 

  

our long history of profitable growth is founded on a commitment to a relatively simple business model providing a broad base of customers with their basic everyday and household needs supplemented with a variety of general merchandise items at everyday low prices in conveniently located smallbox stores we continually evaluate the needs and demands of our customers and modify our merchandise selections and pricing accordingly while remaining focused on increasing profitability cash generation and returns for our shareholders 

  

our operating priorities are summarized as follows 1 driving profitable sales growth 2 capturing growth opportunities 3 enhancing our position as a lowcost operator and 4 investing in our people as a competitive advantage for more information on these operating priorities see the “executive overview” section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in part ii item 7 of this report 

  

in fiscal year 2016 we achieved our 27th consecutive year of positive samestore sales growth this growth has taken place in a variety of economic conditions which we believe is a result of our compelling value and convenience proposition although no assurances can be given that we will achieve positive samestore sales growth in any given year 

  

compelling value and convenience proposition our ability to deliver highly competitive prices in convenient locations and our easy “in and out” shopping format create a compelling shopping experience that we believe distinguishes us from other discount retailers as well as convenience drug grocery online and mass merchant retailers our slogan “save time save money every day” summarizes our appeal to customers we believe our ability to effectively deliver both value and convenience allows us to succeed in small markets with limited shopping alternatives as well as in larger and more competitive markets our value and convenience proposition is evidenced by the following attributes of our business model 

  



 



  



  



  

substantial growth opportunities we believe we have substantial long‑term growth potential in the us we have identified significant opportunities to add new stores in both existing and new markets in addition we have opportunities to relocate or remodel locations within our existing store base to better serve our customers our attractive store economics including a relatively low initial investment and simple low‑cost operating model have allowed us to grow our store base to current levels and provide us significant opportunities to continue our profitable store growth strategy 

  

our merchandise 

  

we offer a focused assortment of everyday necessities which help to drive frequent customer visits and key items in a broad range of general merchandise categories our product assortment provides the opportunity for our customers to address most of their basic shopping needs with one trip we sell high‑quality nationally advertised brands from leading manufacturers additionally our private brand consumables offer even greater value with options to purchase national brand equivalent products as well as value items at substantial discounts to the national brand 

  

consumables is our largest merchandise category and has become a larger percentage of our total sales in recent years as indicated in the table below consumables include paper and cleaning products such as paper towels bath tissue paper dinnerware trash and storage bags laundry and other home cleaning supplies packaged food such as cereals canned soups and vegetables condiments spices sugar and flour perishables such as milk eggs bread refrigerated and frozen food beer and wine snacks such as candy cookies crackers salty snacks and carbonated beverages health and beauty such as over‑the‑counter medicines and personal care products including soap body wash shampoo dental hygiene and foot care products pet such as pet supplies and pet food and tobacco products 

  

seasonal products include decorations toys batteries small electronics greeting cards stationery prepaid phones and accessories gardening supplies hardware automotive and home office supplies 

  

home products include kitchen supplies cookware small appliances light bulbs storage containers frames candles craft supplies and kitchen bed and bath soft goods 

  

apparel includes casual everyday apparel for infants toddlers girls boys women and men as well as socks underwear disposable diapers shoes and accessories 

  

 

the percentage of net sales of each of our four categories of merchandise for the fiscal years indicated below was as follows 

  



  

our home products and seasonal categories typically account for the highest gross profit margins and the consumables category typically accounts for the lowest gross profit margin 

  

the dollar general store 

  

the typical dollar general store is operated by a store manager one or more assistant store managers and three or more sales associates our stores generally feature a low‑cost no frills building with limited maintenance capital low operating costs and a focused merchandise offering within a broad range of categories allowing us to deliver low retail prices while generating strong cash flows and capital investment returns our stores average approximately 7400 square feet of selling space and approximately 70 of our stores are located in towns of 20000 or fewer people we generally have had good success in locating suitable store sites in the past and we believe that there is ample opportunity for new store growth in existing and new markets in addition we believe we have significant opportunities available for our relocation and remodel programs 

  

our store growth over the past three years is summarized in the following table 

  



  

our customers 

  

our customers seek value and convenience depending on their financial situation and geographic proximity customers’ reliance on dollar general varies from fill‑in shopping to making periodic trips to stock up on household items to making weekly or more frequent trips to meet most essential needs we generally locate our stores and plan our merchandise selections to best serve the needs of our core customers the low and fixed income households often underserved by other retailers and we are focused on helping them make the most of their spending dollars at the same time however loyal dollar general shoppers from a wide range of income brackets and life stages appreciate our quality merchandise as well as our attractive value and convenience proposition 

  

our suppliers 

  

we purchase merchandise from a wide variety of suppliers and maintain direct buying relationships with many producers of national brand merchandise despite our broad offering we maintain only a limited number of items per category giving us a negotiating advantage in dealing with our suppliers our largest and second largest suppliers each accounted for approximately 8 of our purchases in 2016 our private brands come from a diversified supplier base we directly imported approximately 6 of our purchases at cost in 2016 

  

we have consistently managed to obtain sufficient quantities of core merchandise and believe that if one or more of our current sources of supply became unavailable we generally would be able to obtain alternative 

 

sources without experiencing a substantial disruption of our business however such alternative sources could increase our merchandise costs or reduce the quality of our merchandise and an inability to obtain alternative sources could adversely affect our sales 

  

distribution and transportation 

  

our stores are currently supported by fourteen distribution centers located strategically throughout our geographic footprint our fifteenth distribution center in jackson georgia is under construction with a goal to begin shipping from this facility in late 2017 we have announced plans to build our sixteenth distribution center in amsterdam new york with a planned completion date in fall 2018 we lease additional temporary warehouse space as necessary to support our distribution needs we continually analyze and rebalance the network to ensure that it remains efficient and provides the service our stores require see “—properties” below for additional information pertaining to our distribution centers 

  

most of our merchandise flows through our distribution centers and is delivered to our stores by third‑party trucking firms utilizing our trailers we also own 39 trucks with which we transport our merchandise in addition vendors or third‑party distributors ship certain food items and other merchandise directly to our stores 

  

seasonality 

  

our business is somewhat seasonal generally our highest sales volume occurs in the fourth quarter which includes the christmas selling season in addition our quarterly results can be affected by the timing of certain holidays the timing of new store openings and store closings and the amount of sales contributed by new and existing stores we typically purchase substantial amounts of inventory in the third quarter and incur higher shipping and payroll costs in the third quarter in anticipation of increased sales activity during the fourth quarter see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

  

our competition 

  

we operate in the basic discount consumer goods market which is highly competitive with respect to price store location merchandise quality assortment and presentation in‑stock consistency and customer service we compete with discount stores and with many other retailers including mass merchandise warehouse club grocery drug convenience variety online omnichannel and specialty stores these other retail companies operate stores in many of the areas where we operate and many of them engage in extensive advertising and marketing efforts our direct competitors include family dollar dollar tree big lots fred’s 99 cents only and various local independent operators as well as walmart target kroger aldi walgreens cvs and riteaid among others certain of our competitors have greater financial distribution marketing and other resources than we do competition has intensified and will continue to do so as competitors move into or increase their presence in our geographic markets and increase the availability of mobile and webbased technology to facilitate online shopping and real‑time product and price comparisons and to create an omnichannel shopping experience 

  

we believe that we differentiate ourselves from other forms of retailing by offering consistently low prices in a convenient small‑store format we believe that our prices are competitive due in part to our low‑cost operating structure and the relatively limited assortment of products offered purchasing large volumes of merchandise within our focused assortment in each merchandise category allows us to keep our average costs low contributing to our ability to offer competitive everyday low prices to our customers see “—our business model” above for further discussion of our competitive situation 

  

our employees 

  

as of march 3 2017 we employed approximately 121000 full‑time and part‑time employees including divisional and regional managers district managers store managers other store personnel and distribution center and administrative personnel we have increasingly focused on recruiting training motivating and retaining 

 

employees and we believe that the quality performance and morale of our employees continue to be an important part of our success in recent years we currently are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements

 item 1a risk factors 

  

you should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information contained in this report and other filings that we make from time to time with the sec including our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations or liquidity these risks are not the only risks we face our business financial condition results of operations or liquidity could also be adversely affected by additional factors that apply to all companies generally or by risks not currently known to us or that we currently view to be immaterial we can provide no assurance and make no representation that our risk mitigation efforts although we believe they are reasonable will be successful 

  

economic conditions and other economic factors may adversely affect our financial performance and other aspects of our business by negatively impacting our customers’ disposable income or discretionary spending affecting our ability to plan and execute our strategic initiatives increasing our costs of goods sold and selling general and administrative expenses and adversely affecting our sales or profitability 

  

we believe many of our customers have fixed or low incomes and generally have limited discretionary spending dollars any factor that could adversely affect that disposable income would decrease our customers’ confidence spending and number of trips to our stores and could cause our customers to shift their spending to products other than those sold by us or to our less profitable product choices all of which could result in lower net sales decreases in inventory turnover greater markdowns on inventory a change in the mix of products we sell and a reduction in profitability due to lower margins factors that could reduce our customers’ disposable income and over which we exercise no influence include but are not limited to adverse economic conditions such as increased or sustained high unemployment or underemployment levels inflation increases in fuel or other energy costs and interest rates lack of available credit consumer debt levels higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws concerns over government mandated participation in health insurance programs increasing healthcare costs and decreases in or elimination of government subsidies such as unemployment and food assistance programs 

  

many of the factors identified above that affect disposable income as well as commodity rates transportation costs including the costs of diesel fuel costs of labor insurance and healthcare foreign exchange rate fluctuations lease costs measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade changes in other laws and regulations and other economic factors also affect our ability to plan and execute our strategic initiatives our cost of goods sold and our selling general and administrative expenses and may have other adverse consequences which we are unable to fully anticipate or control all of which may adversely affect our sales or profitability we have limited or no ability to control many of these factors 

  

our plans depend significantly on strategies and initiatives designed to increase sales and improve the efficiencies costs and effectiveness of our operations and failure to achieve or sustain these plans could affect our performance adversely 

  

we have shortterm and longterm strategies and initiatives such as those relating to merchandising marketing real estate sourcing shrink private brand distribution and transportation store operations store formats budgeting and expense reduction and technology in various stages of testing evaluation and implementation upon which we expect to rely to continue to improve our results of operations and financial condition and to achieve our financial plans these initiatives are inherently risky and uncertain even when tested successfully in their application to our business in general it is possible that successful testing can result partially from resources and attention that cannot be duplicated in broader implementation particularly in light of the diverse geographic locations of our stores and the decentralized nature of our field management general implementation also may be negatively affected by other risk factors described herein successful systemwide implementation relies on consistency of training stability of workforce ease of execution and the absence of offsetting factors that can influence results adversely failure to achieve successful implementation of our initiatives or the cost of these initiatives exceeding management’s estimates could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

the success of our merchandising initiatives particularly those with respect to non‑consumable merchandise and store‑specific products and allocations depends in part upon our ability to predict consistently and successfully the products that our customers will demand and to identify and timely respond to evolving trends in demographic mixes in our markets and consumer preferences expectations and needs if we are unable to select products that are attractive to customers to timely obtain such products at costs that allow us to sell them at an acceptable profit or to effectively market such products our sales market share and profitability could be adversely affected if our merchandising efforts in the non‑consumables area or the higher margin areas within consumables are unsuccessful we could be further adversely affected by our inability to offset the lower margins associated with our consumables business further our merchandising efforts in the consumables area may not generate the net sales growth and increase customer traffic to the levels needed to offset the lower margins generated by sales of consumables and maintain our targeted gross profit margins 

  

if we cannot open relocate or remodel stores profitably and on schedule our planned future growth will be impeded which would adversely affect sales 

  

our ability to open relocate and remodel profitable stores is a key component of our planned future growth our ability to timely open stores and to expand into additional market areas depends in part on the following factors the availability of attractive store locations the absence of entitlement process or occupancy delays the ability to negotiate acceptable lease and development terms the ability to hire and train new personnel especially store managers in a cost effective manner the ability to identify customer demand in different geographic areas general economic conditions and the availability of capital funding for expansion many of these factors also affect our ability to successfully relocate stores and many of them are beyond our control 

  

delays or failures in opening new stores or completing relocations or remodels or achieving lower than expected sales in these projects could materially adversely affect our growth andor profitability we also may not anticipate all of the challenges imposed by the expansion of our operations and as a result may not meet our targets for opening new stores remodeling or relocating stores or expanding profitably 

  

some new stores and future new store opportunities may be located in areas including but not limited to new states or metro urban areas where we have limited or no meaningful experience or brand recognition those areas may have different competitive and market conditions consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns than our existing markets as well as higher cost of entry these factors may cause our new stores to be initially less successful than stores in our existing markets which could slow future growth in these areas 

  

many new stores will be located in areas where we have existing stores although we have experience in these areas increasing the number of locations in these markets may result in inadvertent oversaturation and temporarily or permanently divert customers and sales from our existing stores thereby adversely affecting our overall financial performance 

  

we face intense competition that could limit our growth opportunities and adversely impact our financial performance 

  

the retail business is highly competitive with respect to price store location merchandise quality product assortment and presentation in‑stock consistency customer service promotional activity customers market share and employees we compete with discount stores and with many other retailers including mass merchandise warehouse club grocery drug convenience variety online retailers and other specialty stores this competitive environment subjects us to the risk of adverse impact to our financial performance because of the lower prices and thus the lower margins that may be required to maintain our competitive position also companies like ours due to customer demographics and other factors may have limited ability to increase prices in response to increased costs without losing competitive position this limitation may adversely affect our margins and financial performance certain of our competitors have greater financial distribution marketing and other resources than we do and may be able to secure better arrangements with suppliers than we can if we fail to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets it could adversely affect our financial performance 

 

competition for customers has intensified as competitors have moved into or increased their presence in our geographic markets and increased the availability of mobile and web‑based technology to facilitate online shopping and real‑time product and price comparisons and to create an omnichannel shopping experience we expect this competition to continue to increase we remain vulnerable to the marketing power and high level of consumer recognition of larger competitors and to the risk that these competitors or others could venture into our industry in a significant way including through the introduction of new store formats further consolidation within the discount retail industry could significantly alter the competitive dynamics of the retail marketplace this consolidation may result in competitors with greatly improved financial resources improved access to merchandise greater market penetration and other improvements in their competitive positions as well as result in the provision of a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices by these consolidated companies which could adversely affect our financial performance 

  

our profitability may be negatively affected by inventory shrinkage 

  

we are subject to the risk of inventory loss and theft we experience significant inventory shrinkage and cannot be sure that incidences of inventory loss and theft will decrease in the future or that the measures we are taking will effectively reduce the problem of inventory shrinkage although some level of inventory shrinkage is an unavoidable cost of doing business if we were to experience higher rates of inventory shrinkage or incur increased security or other costs to combat inventory theft our results of operations and financial condition could be affected adversely 

  

our cash flows from operations may be negatively affected if we are not successful in managing our inventory balances 

  

our inventory balance represented approximately 53 of our total assets exclusive of goodwill and other intangible assets as of february 3 2017 efficient inventory management is a key component of our business success and profitability to be successful we must maintain sufficient inventory levels and an appropriate product mix to meet our customers’ demands without allowing those levels to increase to such an extent that the costs to store and hold the goods unduly impacts our financial results or that subjects us to the risk of increased inventory shrinkage if our buying decisions do not accurately predict customer trends we inappropriately price products or our expectations about customer spending levels are inaccurate we may have to take unanticipated markdowns to dispose of the excess inventory which also can adversely impact our financial results we continue to focus on ways to reduce these risks but we cannot make assurances that we will be successful in our inventory management if we are not successful in managing our inventory balances our cash flows from operations may be negatively affected 

  

a significant disruption to our distribution network to the capacity of our distribution centers or to the timely receipt of inventory could adversely impact sales or increase our transportation costs which would decrease our profits 

  

we rely on our distribution and transportation network to provide goods to our stores in a timely and cost‑effective manner using various modes of transportation including ocean rail and truck we and our vendors move goods from vendor locations to our distribution centers deliveries to our stores occur from our distribution centers or directly from our vendors any disruption unanticipated or unusual expense or operational failure related to this process could affect store operations negatively for example delivery delays or increases in transportation costs including through increased fuel costs increased carrier rates or driver wages as a result of driver shortages a decrease in transportation capacity for overseas shipments or work stoppages or slowdowns could significantly decrease our ability to make sales and earn profits labor shortages or work stoppages in the transportation industry or long‑term disruptions to the national and international transportation infrastructure that lead to delays or interruptions of deliveries or which would necessitate our securing alternative labor or shipping suppliers could also increase our costs or otherwise negatively affect our business 

  

we maintain a network of distribution facilities and are moving forward with plans to build new facilities to support our growth objectives delays in opening distribution centers could adversely affect our future financial performance by slowing store growth which may in turn reduce revenue growth or by increasing transportation 

 

costs in addition distribution‑related construction or expansion projects entail risks that could cause delays and cost overruns such as shortages of materials or skilled labor work stoppages unforeseen construction scheduling engineering environmental or geological problems weather interference fires or other casualty losses and unanticipated cost increases the completion date and ultimate cost of these projects could differ significantly from initial expectations due to construction‑related or other reasons we cannot guarantee that any project will be completed on time or within established budgets 

  

risks associated with or faced by our suppliers could adversely affect our financial performance 

  

the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers and we are dependent on our vendors to supply merchandise in a timely and efficient manner in 2016 our largest and second largest suppliers each accounted for approximately 8 of our purchases we have not experienced any difficulty in obtaining sufficient quantities of core merchandise and believe that if one or more of our current sources of supply became unavailable we would generally be able to obtain alternative sources without experiencing a substantial disruption of our business however such alternative sources could increase our merchandise costs result in a temporary reduction in store inventory levels and reduce the quality of our merchandise and an inability to obtain alternative sources could adversely affect our sales additionally if a supplier fails to deliver on its commitments whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons we could experience merchandise out‑of‑stocks that could lead to lost sales and damage to our reputation 

  

we directly imported approximately 6 of our purchases measured at cost in 2016 but many of our domestic vendors directly import their products or components of their products changes to the prices and flow of these goods for any reason such as political unrest or acts of war currency fluctuations disruptions in maritime lanes port labor disputes and economic conditions and instability in the countries in which foreign suppliers are located the financial instability of suppliers suppliers’ failure to meet our standards issues with labor practices of our suppliers or labor problems they may experience such as strikes stoppages or slowdowns which could also increase labor costs during and following the disruption the availability and cost of raw materials to suppliers increased import duties merchandise quality or safety issues transport availability and cost increases in wage rates and taxes transport security inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located or from which they import are beyond our control and could adversely affect our operations and profitability while we are working to reduce our dependency on goods produced in china a substantial amount of our imported merchandise still comes from china and thus a change in the chinese leadership economic and market conditions internal economic stimulus actions or currency or other policies as well as increases in costs of labor and wage taxes could negatively impact our merchandise costs in addition the united states’ foreign trade policies duties tariffs and other impositions on imported goods trade sanctions imposed on certain countries the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade and port labor agreements are beyond our control these and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our business and financial performance as we increase our imports of merchandise from foreign vendors the risks associated with these imports also will increase and we may be exposed to additional or different risks as we increase imports of goods produced in countries other than china 

  

our private brands may not maintain broad market acceptance and may increase the risks we face 

  

the sale of private brand items is an important component of our sales growth and gross profit rate enhancement plans we have invested in our development and procurement resources and marketing efforts relating to these private brand offerings we believe that our success in maintaining broad market acceptance of our private brands depends on many factors including pricing our costs quality customer perception and the timely development and introduction of new products we may not achieve or maintain our expected sales for our private brands the sale and expansion of our private brand offerings also subjects us to certain risks such as potential product liability risks and mandatory or voluntary product recalls potential supply chain and distribution chain disruptions for raw materials and finished products our ability to successfully protect our proprietary rights and successfully navigate and avoid claims related to the proprietary rights of third parties our ability to successfully administer and comply with applicable contractual obligations and legal and regulatory requirements and other risks generally encountered by entities that source sell and market exclusive branded offerings for retail 

 

an increase in sales of our private brands may also adversely affect sales of our vendors’ products which in turn could adversely affect our relationship with certain of our vendors any failure to appropriately address some or all of these risks could have a significant adverse effect on our private brand initiatives and on our reputation business results of operations and financial condition 

  

product liability product recall or other product safety claims could adversely affect our business reputation and financial performance 

  

all of our vendors and their products must comply with applicable product safety laws and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all applicable safety standards however product liability personal injury or other claims may be asserted against us relating to product contamination product tampering mislabeling recall and other safety issues with respect to the products that we sell 

  

we seek but may not be successful in obtaining contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from our vendors if we do not have adequate contractual indemnification or insurance available such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations our ability to obtain indemnification from foreign vendors may be hindered by our ability to obtain jurisdiction over such vendors to enforce contractual indemnification obligations even with adequate insurance and indemnification such claims could significantly damage our reputation and consumer confidence in our products our litigation expenses could increase as well which also could have a materially negative impact on our results of operations even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued 

  

we are subject to governmental regulations procedures and requirements a significant change in or noncompliance with these regulations could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance 

  

our business is subject to numerous and frequently changing federal state and local laws and regulations we routinely incur significant costs in complying with these regulations the complexity of the regulatory environment in which we operate and the related cost of compliance are increasing due to additional legal and regulatory requirements our expanding operations and increased enforcement efforts further uncertainties exist regarding the future application of certain of these legal requirements to our business new laws regulations policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices particularly those dealing with environmental compliance product safety food safety information security and privacy and labor and employment among others or changes in existing laws regulations policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices particularly those governing the sale of products or employee wages may result in significant added expenses or may require extensive system and operating changes that may be difficult to implement andor could materially increase our cost of doing business untimely compliance or noncompliance with applicable regulations or untimely or incomplete execution of a required product recall can result in the imposition of penalties including loss of licenses or significant fines or monetary penalties class action litigation or other litigation in addition to reputational damage additionally changes in tax laws the interpretation of existing laws or our failure to sustain our reporting positions on examination could adversely affect our effective tax rate 

  

litigation may adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

our business is subject to the risk of litigation by employees consumers suppliers competitors shareholders government agencies and others through private actions class actions administrative proceedings regulatory actions or other litigation the outcome of litigation particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions is difficult to assess or quantify plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to these lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time in addition certain of these lawsuits if decided adversely to us or settled by us may result in liability material to our financial statements as a whole or may negatively affect our operating results if changes to our business operations are required the cost to defend future litigation may be significant there also may be adverse publicity associated with litigation that could negatively affect customer perception of our business regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable as a result 

 

litigation may adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding certain of these pending matters 

  

our current insurance program may expose us to unexpected costs and negatively affect our financial performance 

  

our insurance coverage reflects deductibles self‑insured retentions limits of liability and similar provisions that we believe are prudent based on the dispersion of our operations however there are types of losses we may incur but against which we cannot be insured or which we believe are not economically reasonable to insure such as losses due to acts of war employee and certain other crime certain wage and hour and other employment‑related claims including class actions actions based on certain consumer protection laws and some natural and other disasters or similar events if we incur these losses and they are material our business could suffer certain material events may result in sizable losses for the insurance industry and adversely impact the availability of adequate insurance coverage or result in excessive premium increases to offset negative insurance market trends we may elect to self‑insure accept higher deductibles or reduce the amount of coverage in response to these market changes in addition we self‑insure a significant portion of expected losses under our workers’ compensation automobile liability general liability and group health insurance programs unanticipated changes in any applicable actuarial assumptions and management estimates underlying our recorded liabilities for these losses including expected increases in medical and indemnity costs could result in materially different expenses than expected under these programs which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition although we continue to maintain property insurance for catastrophic events at our store support center and distribution centers we are effectively self‑insured for other property losses if we experience a greater number of these losses than we anticipate our financial performance could be adversely affected 

  

natural disasters and unusual weather conditions whether or not caused by climate change pandemic outbreaks terrorist acts and global political events could disrupt business and result in lower sales and otherwise adversely affect our financial performance 

  

the occurrence of one or more natural disasters such as hurricanes fires floods tornadoes and earthquakes unusual weather conditions pandemic outbreaks terrorist acts or disruptive global political events such as civil unrest in countries in which our suppliers are located or similar disruptions could adversely affect our business and financial performance uncharacteristic or significant weather conditions can affect consumer shopping patterns which could lead to lost sales or greater than expected markdowns and adversely affect our short‑term results of operations to the extent these events result in the closure of one or more of our distribution centers a significant number of stores or our corporate headquarters or impact one or more of our key suppliers our operations and financial performance could be materially adversely affected through an inability to make deliveries or provide other support functions to our stores and through lost sales in addition these events could result in increases in fuel or other energy prices or a fuel shortage delays in opening new stores the temporary lack of an adequate work force in a market the temporary or long‑term disruption in the supply of products from some domestic and overseas suppliers the temporary disruption in the transport of goods from overseas delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution centers or stores the inability of customers to reach or have transportation to our stores directly affected by such events the temporary reduction in the availability of products in our stores and disruption of our utility services or to our information systems these events also can have indirect consequences such as increases in the costs of insurance if they result in significant loss of property or other insurable damage 

  

any failure to maintain the security of information we hold relating to our customers employees and vendors whether as a result of cybersecurity attacks or otherwise could expose us to litigation government enforcement actions and costly response measures and could materially disrupt our operations and harm our reputation and sales 

  

in connection with sales we transmit confidential credit and debit card information we also have access to collect or maintain certain private or confidential information regarding our customers employees and vendors as well as our business additionally under certain circumstances we may share information with vendors that assist us in conducting our business for example third‑party vendors assist us in the transmittal of 

 

credit and debit card information in connection with sales as required by law or otherwise in accordance with our privacy policy while we have implemented procedures and technology intended to protect and safeguard our information and require appropriate controls of our vendors it is possible that cyberattackers might compromise our security measures or those of our technology and other vendors in the future and obtain the personal information of our customers employees and vendors that we hold or our business information as cyberattacks are rapidly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated and may not immediately produce signs of intrusion moreover employee error or malfeasance or other irregularities may result in a defeat of our or our third‑party vendors’ security measures and breach our or our third‑party vendors’ information systems 

  

because we accept debit and credit cards for payment we are subject to the payment card industry data security standards “pci dss” issued by the payment card industry security standards council pci dss contains compliance guidelines and standards with regard to our security surrounding the physical and electronic storage processing and transmission of cardholder data additionally we have implemented technology in all of our stores to allow for the acceptance of europay mastercard and visa emv credit transactions complying with pci dss standards and implementing related procedures technology and information security measures require significant resources and ongoing attention however even as we comply with pci dss standards and offer emv technology in our stores we may be vulnerable to and unable to detect and appropriately respond to data security breaches and data loss including cybersecurity attacks or other breach of cardholder data 

  

a security breach of any kind whether experienced by us or one of our vendors which could be undetected for a period of time or any failure by us to comply with the applicable privacy and information security laws regulations and standards could expose us to risks of data loss litigation government enforcement actions fines or penalties credit card brand assessments and costly response measures including for example providing notification to and credit monitoring services for affected customers as well as further upgrades to our security measures which may not be covered by or may exceed the coverage limits of our insurance policies and could materially disrupt our operations any resulting negative media attention and publicity could significantly harm our reputation which could cause us to lose market share as a result of customers discontinuing the use of debit or credit cards in our stores or not shopping in our stores altogether and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance 

  

material damage or interruptions to our information systems as a result of external factors staffing shortages or challenges or difficulties in maintaining or updating our existing technology or developing or implementing new technology could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 

  

we depend on a variety of information technology systems for the efficient functioning of our business and are continually improving our information processes and computer systems to better run our business these technology initiatives may not deliver desired results or may do so on a delayed schedule additionally such systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages facility damage computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses cybersecurity breaches cyber attacks natural disasters and human error damage or interruption to these systems may require a significant investment to fix or replace them and we may suffer interruptions or disruptions in our operations in the interim may experience loss or corruption of critical data and may receive negative publicity all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 

  

we also rely heavily on our information technology staff failure to meet these staffing needs may negatively affect our ability to fulfill our technology initiatives while continuing to provide maintenance on existing systems we rely on certain vendors to maintain and periodically upgrade many of these systems so that they can continue to support our business the software programs supporting many of our systems were licensed to us by independent software developers the inability of these vendors developers or us to continue to maintain and upgrade these information systems and software programs would disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations if we were unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner and could expose us to greater risk of a cybersecurity breach or other cyber attack in addition costs and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology or with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems could also disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations 

  

 

failure to attract train and retain qualified employees while controlling labor costs as well as other labor issues could adversely affect our financial performance 

  

our future growth and performance positive customer experience and regulatory compliance depends on our ability to attract train retain and motivate qualified employees many of whom are in positions with historically high rates of turnover our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling our labor costs is subject to many external factors including competition for and availability of qualified personnel in a given market unemployment levels within those markets prevailing wage rates minimum wage laws health and other insurance costs changes in employment and labor laws including changes in the process for our employees to join a union or other workplace regulations including changes in “entitlement” programs such as health insurance and paid leave programs and our reputation and relevance within the labor market if we are unable to attract and retain adequate numbers of qualified employees our operations customer service levels and support functions could suffer to the extent a significant portion of our employee base unionizes or attempts to unionize our labor costs could increase in addition potential regulatory changes relating to overtime exemptions for certain employees under federal and state laws could result in increased labor costs to our business and negatively affect our operating results if the regulatory changes are implemented our ability to pass along labor costs to our customers is constrained by our everyday low price model and we may not be able to offset such increased costs elsewhere in our business 

  

our success depends on our executive officers and other key personnel if we lose key personnel or are unable to hire additional qualified personnel our business may be harmed 

  

our future success depends to a significant degree on the skills experience and efforts of our executive officers and other key personnel the unexpected loss of the services of any of our executive officers could have an adverse effect on our operations there can be no assurance that our executive succession planning retention or hiring efforts will be successful competition for skilled and experienced management personnel is intense and our future success will also depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and a failure to attract and retain new qualified personnel could have an adverse effect on our operations we do not currently maintain key person life insurance policies with respect to our executive officers or key personnel 

  

because our business is somewhat seasonal with the highest volume of net sales during the fourth quarter adverse events during the fourth quarter could materially affect our financial statements as a whole 

  

we generally recognize our highest volume of net sales during the christmas selling season which occurs in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year in anticipation of this holiday we purchase substantial amounts of seasonal inventory adverse events such as deteriorating economic conditions high unemployment rates high gas prices public transportation disruptions or unusual or unanticipated adverse weather could result in lower‑than‑planned sales during the christmas selling season an excess of seasonal merchandise inventory could result if our net sales during the christmas selling season fall below seasonal norms or expectations if our fourth quarter sales results were substantially below expectations our financial performance and operating results could be adversely affected by unanticipated markdowns especially in seasonal merchandise 

  

deterioration in market conditions or changes in our credit profile could adversely affect our business operations and financial condition 

  

we rely on the positive cash flow we generate from our operating activities and our access to the credit and capital markets to fund our operations growth strategy and return of cash to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends changes in the credit and capital markets including market disruptions limited liquidity and interest rate fluctuations may increase the cost of financing or restrict our access to these potential sources of future liquidity our continued access to these liquidity sources on favorable terms depends on multiple factors including our operating performance and our credit ratings our debt securities currently have an investment grade rating and a downgrade of this rating likely would negatively impact our access to the debt capital markets and increase our cost of borrowing as a result any disruptions or turmoil in the debt markets or any downgrade of our credit ratings could adversely affect our business operations and financial condition and our ability to return cash to our shareholders there can be no assurances that our ability to obtain additional financing 

 

through the debt markets will not be adversely impacted by economic conditions or that we will be able to maintain or improve our current credit ratings 

  

new accounting guidance or changes in the interpretation or application of existing accounting guidance could adversely affect our financial performance 

  

the implementation of new accounting standards will require extensive systems internal process and other changes that could increase our operating costs and also will result in changes to our financial statements in particular the implementation of accounting standards related to leases as issued by the financial accounting standards board “fasb” are requiring us to make significant changes to our lease management and other accounting systems and will result in significant changes to our financial statements additionally the fasb has issued accounting standards related to revenue recognition and intraentity transfers that could result in changes to our financial statements 

  

us generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by our management changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments by our management could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance the outcome of such changes could include litigation or regulatory actions which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations

executive overview 

  

we are among the largest discount retailers in the united states by number of stores with 13429 stores located in 44 states as of march 3 2017 with the greatest concentration of stores in the southern southwestern midwestern and eastern united states we offer a broad selection of merchandise including consumable products such as food paper and cleaning products health and beauty products and pet supplies and nonconsumable products such as seasonal merchandise home decor and domestics and basic apparel our merchandise includes highquality national brands from leading manufacturers as well as our own value and comparable quality private brand selections with prices at substantial discounts to national brands we offer our customers these national brand and private brand products at everyday low prices typically 10 or less in our convenient smallbox locations 

  

because the customers we serve are valueconscious many with low or fixed incomes we are intensely focused on helping them make the most of their spending dollars we believe our convenient store format and broad selection of highquality products at compelling values have driven our substantial growth and financial success over the years like other retailers we have been operating for several years in an environment with ongoing macroeconomic challenges and uncertainties our core customers are often among the first to be affected by negative or uncertain economic conditions and are among the last to feel the effects of improving economic conditions particularly when as in the recent past trends are inconsistent and their duration unknown the primary macroeconomic factors that affect our core customers include the unemployment rate the underemployment rate wage growth fuel prices and changes to certain government assistance programs such as the 2016 changes to the supplemental nutrition assistance program which had the effect of not only reducing benefit levels but also eliminating benefit eligibility for certain individuals additionally our customers are impacted by increases in those expenses that generally comprise a large portion of their budget such as rent and healthcare and during 2016 these expenses increased at a rate that was greater than many of our core customers’ growth in income we believe the overall effect of the factors listed above have negatively affected our traffic and along with deflationary pressures including both lower commodity costs and pricing actions on our products have negatively affected samestore sales 

  

during 2016 we undertook a strategic review of our business and the retail environment that was designed to help identify additional longterm growth opportunities this strategic review resulted in prioritizing those growth opportunities that we believe are most important for the business such as leveraging digital tools and technology while ensuring that we maintain our brand heritage and build upon our organizational capabilities 

  

following this strategic review we remain committed to the following longterm operating priorities as we consistently strive to improve our performance while retaining our customercentric focus 1 driving profitable sales growth 2 capturing growth opportunities 3 enhancing our position as a lowcost operator and 4 investing in our people as a competitive advantage 

  

we seek to drive profitable sales growth through initiatives aimed at increasing customer traffic and average transaction amount as well as an ongoing focus on enhancing our margins while maintaining both everyday low price and affordability 

  

historically our sales of consumables which tend to have lower gross margins have been the key drivers of net sales and customer traffic while sales of nonconsumables which tend to have higher gross 

 

margins have contributed to profitable sales growth and an increase in average transaction amount we expect these trends to continue in 2017 samestore sales growth is key to achieving our objectives as noted above in recent periods economic and competitive deflationary pressures resulting in lower commodity costs and prices has negatively affected our net and same store sales performance and the continuation if any of these deflationary pressures could negatively impact sales of certain items going forward additionally we have made certain pricing adjustments and marketing investments in designated geographies with a focus on the consumables category to drive customer traffic these pricing adjustments and marketing investments are performing well in the majority of stores that received them with improvements in transactions units and samestore sales we expect to continue to evaluate and refresh these pricing adjustments across various items categories and markets as needed 

  

during 2016 we made significant progress with the rollout of other initiatives designed to increase customer traffic and sales such as the expansion of coolers in existing stores the expansion of certain product classes including health and beauty care party and stationery and improvement in our instock position we plan to further this progress in 2017 with the continued expansion of coolers the rollout of additional merchandising initiatives across all merchandise categories a continued focus on improving our instock position and the addition of a queue line similar to that in our dg16 layout stores discussed below in a portion of our existing store base we will continue to utilize our updated customer segmentation information which has provided us with deeper insights into the spending habits for each of our core customer segments to refine these initiatives and drive our category management process as we optimize our assortment and expand into those products that are most likely to drive customer traffic to our stores we plan to enhance our advertising effectiveness in 2017 by further integrating our traditional and digital media mix designed to ensure that we reach our target customers where when and how they decide to engage with us while also targeting a higher return on investment we also plan to continue investing in our existing store base through many of these targeted merchandising initiatives with a goal to drive increased customer traffic average transaction amount and samestore sales 

  

we demonstrate our commitment to the affordability needs of our core customer by pricing more than 80 of our stockkeeping units at 5 or less at the end of 2016 however as we work to provide everyday low prices and meet our customers’ affordability needs we also remain focused on enhancing our margins through effective category management inventory shrink reduction initiatives private brands penetration efforts to improve distribution and transportation efficiencies global sourcing and pricing and markdown optimization with respect to category management we strive to maintain an appropriate mix of consumables and nonconsumables sales because as noted above the mix of sales affects profitability due to the varying gross margins between and even within the consumables and nonconsumables categories to support our efforts to reduce inventory shrink we continue to implement additional instore defensive merchandising and technologybased tools such as electronic article surveillance and videoenabled exceptionbased reporting in select stores we strive to balance these and other shrink reduction efforts with our efforts to improve our instock position we seek to reduce our stem miles and optimize loads to improve distribution and transportation efficiencies 

  

to support our other operating priorities we remain focused on capturing growth opportunities and innovating within our channel in 2016 we continued to expand our store count opening 900 stores and remodeling or relocating 906 stores in 2017 we intend to open approximately 1000 stores and to relocate or remodel approximately 900 stores 

  

we continue to innovate within our channel and during 2016 we began implementing the dg16 store layout for all new stores relocations and remodels in addition we also began testing a smaller format store less than 6000 square feet which we believe could allow us to capture growth opportunities in metropolitan areas as well as rural areas with a low number of households in 2017 we plan to incorporate into a portion of our existing store base certain lessons learned from the dg16 layout and smaller format stores as well those learned in connection with the conversion of the larger format former walmart express stores we acquired during 2016 to support our new store growth and drive productivity we continue to make investments in our distribution center network during 2016 we opened new distribution centers in texas and wisconsin our fifteenth distribution center in jackson georgia is under construction with a goal to begin shipping from this facility in late 2017 we 

 

expect to break ground on our sixteenth distribution center in amsterdam new york in mid2017 to support our northeast growth 

  

we have established a position as a lowcost operator continuously seeking ways to reduce or control costs that do not affect our customers’ shopping experience we continued to enhance this position during 2016 through our zerobased budgeting initiative streamlining our business while also reducing certain expenses as a percentage of sales this initiative was successful in 2016 as evidenced by reductions in administrative payroll advertising and certain other costs and we believe this initiative has the momentum to assist in leveraging sga expenses at a lower samestore sales growth percentage over the long term in addition we remain committed to simplifying or eliminating storelevel tasks and processes so that those time savings can be reinvested by our store managers and their teams in important areas such as enhanced customer service higher instock levels and improved store standards 

  

our employees are a competitive advantage and we are always searching for ways to continue investing in them we invest in our employees in an effort to create an environment that attracts and retains talented personnel as we believe that particularly at the store level employees who are promoted from within generally have longer tenures and are greater contributors to improvements in our financial performance during 2016 these efforts helped to achieve our lowest level of store manager turnover in four years during 2017 we will build upon this foundation by investing approximately 70 million primarily for increased compensation and training for our store managers as well as strategic initiatives our store managers play a critical role in our customer experience and we anticipate this investment in their compensation will contribute to improved customer experience scores higher sales lower shrink and improved turnover metrics the proposed changes to the overtime exemption regulations under the fair labor standards act “flsa” are subject to an injunction by a federal court and if such regulations were to be implemented we likely will incur incremental sga expenses 

  

to further enhance shareholder return in 2017 we plan to continue to repurchase shares of our common stock although we expect to do so in a lower amount than in 2016 and pay quarterly cash dividends subject to board discretion 

  

a continued focus on our four operating priorities as discussed above coupled with strong cash flow management and share repurchases resulted in solid overall operating and financial performance in 2016 as compared to 2015 as set forth below basis points as referred to below are equal to 001 as a percentage of net sales

results of operations 

  

accounting periods the following text contains references to years 2016 2015 and 2014 which represent fiscal years ended february 3 2017 january 29 2016 and january 30 2015 respectively our fiscal year ends on the friday closest to january 31 fiscal year 2016 was a 53week accounting period and fiscal years 2015 and 2014 were 52week accounting periods 

  

seasonality  the nature of our business is somewhat seasonal primarily because of sales of christmasrelated merchandise sales in our fourth quarter november december and january have historically been higher than sales achieved in each of the first three quarters of the fiscal year expenses and to a greater extent operating profit vary by quarter results of a period shorter than a full year may not be indicative of results expected for the entire year furthermore the seasonal nature of our business may affect comparisons between periods for more information about the seasonality of our business see “seasonality” included in part 1 item 1 of this report 

  

 

the following table contains results of operations data for fiscal years 2016 2015 and 2014 and the dollar and percentage variances among those years 

  



  

net sales  the net sales increase in 2016 reflects a samestore sales increase of 09 compared to 2015 primarily due to an increase in average transaction amount accompanied by traffic that was essentially unchanged as compared to the prior year samestore sales were affected by the factors discussed in the executive overview above for 2016 there were 12383 samestores which accounted for sales of 203 billion samestores include stores that have been open for at least 13 months and remain open at the end of the reporting period changes in samestore sales are calculated based on the comparable calendar weeks in the prior year and include stores that have been remodeled expanded or relocated samestore sales results reflect positive results in the consumables and home products categories partially offset by negative results in our apparel and seasonal categories net sales for the 53 rd week of 2016 totaled 3987 million the remainder of the increase in sales in 2016 was attributable to new stores partially offset by sales from closed stores 

  

the net sales increase in 2015 reflects a samestore sales increase of 28 compared to 2014 for 2015 there were 11706 samestores which accounted for sales of 1925 billion the increase in sales reflects increases in both customer traffic and average transaction amounts samestore sales results reflect positive results in all four of our product categories with the greatest increases in sales of consumables and seasonal followed by home products and apparel the remainder of the increase in sales in 2015 was attributable to new stores partially offset by sales from closed stores 

  

 

of our four major merchandise categories the consumables category which generally has a lower gross profit rate than the other three categories has grown most significantly over the past several years because of the impact of sales mix on gross profit we continually review our merchandise mix and strive to adjust it when appropriate 

  

gross profit the gross profit rate as a percentage of sales was 308 in 2016 gross profit increased by 76 in 2016 as compared to 2015 and as a percentage of sales declined by 11 basis points over the same period the gross profit rate decrease in 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily reflects increased markdowns which were driven by promotional and inventory clearance activity sales of lowermargin consumables comprising a greater proportion of net sales and increased inventory shrink partially offset by higher initial inventory markups and lower transportation costs we recorded a lifo benefit of 122 million in 2016 compared to a lifo benefit of 23 million in 2015 

  

the gross profit rate as a percentage of sales was 310 in 2015 compared to 307 in 2014 gross profit increased by 87 in 2015 and as a percentage of sales increased by 27 basis points the gross profit rate increase in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily reflects lower transportation costs and an improved rate of inventory shrinkage partially offset by increased markdowns we recorded a lifo benefit of 23 million in 2015 compared to a lifo provision of 42 million in 2014 

  

sga sga was 215 as a percentage of sales in 2016 increasing by 3 basis points over 2015 the 2016 results reflect increases in retail labor costs which increased at a rate greater than the increase in net sales partially offset by reductions in administrative payroll costs incentive compensation expenses and advertising costs the 2016 results also reflect an increase in disasterrelated expenses of 122 million over 2015 much of which was hurricanerelated 

  

sga was 214 as a percentage of sales in 2015 compared to 213 in 2014 an increase of 10 basis points the 2015 results reflect increases in incentive compensation expenses repairs and maintenance expenses occupancy costs and fees associated with an increase in debit card transactions partially offsetting these items was a higher volume of cash back transactions resulting in increased convenience fees collected from customers the 2014 results reflect expenses of 143 million or 8 basis points as a percentage of sales related to an acquisition that was not completed 

  

interest expense  interest expense increased 109 million to 978 million in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to an increase in average debt outstanding and higher average interest rates see the detailed discussion under “liquidity and capital resources” regarding the financing of various longterm obligations interest expense decreased 13 million to 869 million in 2015 compared to 2014 

  

we had outstanding variablerate debt of 9243 million and 6866 million as of february 3 2017 and january 29 2016 respectively the remainder of our outstanding indebtedness at february 3 2017 and january 29 2016 was fixed rate debt 

  

income taxes  the effective income tax rates for 2016 2015 and 2014 were expenses of 363 371 and 366 respectively 

  

the effective income tax rate for 2016 was 363 compared to a rate of 371 for 2015 which represents a net decrease of 08 percentage points the effective income tax rate was lower in 2016 due principally to the early adoption of a change in accounting guidance related to employee sharebased payments requiring the recognition of excess tax benefits in the statement of income rather than in the balance sheet as reported in prior years 

  

the effective income tax rate for 2015 was 371 compared to a rate of 366 for 2014 which represents a net increase of 05 percentage points the effective income tax rate was lower in 2014 due principally to federal and state reserve releases in 2014 that did not reoccur to the same extent in 2015 as in prior years we receive a 

 

significant income tax benefit related to wages paid to certain newly hired employees that qualify for federal jobs credits principally the work opportunity tax credit or “wotc” in december 2015 congress retroactively extended the federal law authorizing the wotc for the period from january 1 2015 through december 31 2019 

  

off balance sheet arrangements 

  

we are not party to any material off balance sheet arrangements 

  

effects of inflation 

  

in 2016 we experienced product cost deflation reflecting reductions in commodity costs primarily related to food products we experienced minimal overall commodity cost inflation or deflation in 2015 and 2014 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

current financial condition and recent developments 

  

during the past three years we have generated an aggregate of approximately 43 billion in cash flows from operating activities and incurred approximately 14 billion in capital expenditures during that period we expanded the number of stores we operate by 2188 representing growth of approximately 20 and we remodeled or relocated 2702 stores or approximately 20 of the stores we operated as of february 3 2017 in 2017 we intend to continue our current strategy of pursuing store growth remodels and relocations 

  

at february 3 2017 we had a fiveyear 1425 billion unsecured credit agreement and we had outstanding 23 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes as further discussed below during the third quarter of 2016 we established a commercial paper program that may provide borrowing availability of up to 10 billion at february 3 2017 we had total outstanding debt including the current portion of longterm obligations of 32 billion which includes balances under the 2015 term facility and 2015 revolving facility each as defined below commercial paper and senior notes all of which are described in greater detail below we had 9862 million available for borrowing under the unsecured credit agreement that due to our intention to maintain borrowing availability related to the commercial paper program as described below could contribute incremental liquidity of 4957 million at february 3 2017 we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement on february 22 2017 as described further below the information contained in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii item 8 of this report is incorporated herein by reference 

  

we believe our cash flow from operations and existing cash balances combined with availability under the facilities as defined below the commercial paper program and access to the debt markets will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our current obligations projected working capital requirements capital spending and anticipated dividend payments for a period that includes the next twelve months as well as the next several years however our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity may be affected by numerous factors many of which are outside of our control depending on our liquidity levels conditions in the capital markets and other factors we may from time to time consider the issuance of debt equity or other securities the proceeds of which could provide additional liquidity for our operations 

  

for the remainder of fiscal 2017 we anticipate potential borrowings under the unsecured revolving credit facility described below and our commercial paper program to be a maximum of approximately 750 million outstanding at any one time including any anticipated borrowings to fund repurchases of common stock 

  

credit facilities 

  

on february 22 2017 we entered into an unsecured amended and restated credit agreement the “facilities” which consists of a 1750 million senior unsecured term loan facility the “term facility” and a 125 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility the “revolving facility” which provides for the issuance 

 

of letters of credit up to 1750 million the term facility is scheduled to mature on october 20 2020 and the revolving facility is scheduled to mature on february 22 2022 the facilities replaced our previous unsecured credit agreement which consisted of a 4250 million senior unsecured term loan facility the “2015 term facility” and a 10 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility the “2015 revolving facility” 

  

borrowings under the facilities bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable interest rate margin plus at our option either a libor or b a base rate which is usually equal to the prime rate the applicable interest rate margin for borrowings as of march 3 2017 was 110 for libor borrowings and 010 for baserate borrowings and the commitment fee rate is 015 we also must pay a facility fee payable on any used and unused commitment amounts of the facilities and customary fees on letters of credit issued under the revolving facility the applicable interest rate margins for borrowings the facility fees and the letter of credit fees under the facilities are subject to adjustment from time to time based on our longterm senior unsecured debt ratings the weighted average allin interest rate for borrowings under the facilities was 188 as of march 3 2017 

  

the facilities can be voluntarily prepaid in whole or in part at any time without penalty there is no required amortization under the facilities the facilities contain a number of customary affirmative and negative covenants that among other things restrict subject to certain exceptions our including our subsidiaries’ ability to incur additional liens sell all or substantially all of our assets consummate certain fundamental changes or change in our lines of business and incur additional subsidiary indebtedness the facilities also contain financial covenants that require the maintenance of a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio as of march 3 2017 we were in compliance with all such covenants the facilities also contain customary events of default the terms of the term facility and the revolving facility are substantially similar to the terms of the 2015 term facility and the 2015 revolving facility respectively including financial covenants and events of default 

  

as of february 3 2017 under the 2015 revolving facility we had no outstanding borrowings and outstanding letters of credit of 138 million in addition as of february 3 2017 we had outstanding letters of credit of 294 million which were issued pursuant to separate agreements 

  

commercial paper 

  

on august 1 2016 we established a commercial paper program under which we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes the “cp notes” under this program we may issue the cp notes from time to time in an aggregate amount not to exceed 10 billion outstanding at any time the cp notes have maturities of up to 364 days from the date of issue and rank equal in right of payment with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness we intend to maintain available commitments under the revolving facility in an amount at least equal to the amount of cp notes outstanding at any time we had 4905 million of cp notes outstanding at february 3 2017 that were classified as longterm obligations in the consolidated balance sheet due to our intent and ability to refinance these obligations as longterm debt at a weighted average borrowing rate of 10

we have 5000 million aggregate principal amount of 4125 senior notes due 2017 the “2017 senior notes” which are scheduled to mature on july 15 2017 4000 million aggregate principal amount of 1875 senior notes due 2018 the “2018 senior notes” net of discount of 01 million which are scheduled to mature on april 15 2018 9000 million aggregate principal amount of 325 senior notes due 2023 the “2023 senior notes” net of discount of 16 million which are scheduled to mature on april 15 2023 and 5000 million aggregate principal amount of 4150 senior notes due 2025 the “2025 senior notes” net of discount of 07 million which are scheduled to mature on november 1 2025 collectively the 2017 senior notes the 2018 senior notes the 2023 senior notes and the 2025 senior notes comprise the “senior notes” each of which were issued pursuant to an indenture as supplemented and amended by supplemental indentures relating to each series of senior notes as so supplemented and amended the “senior indenture” interest on the 2017 senior notes is 

 

payable in cash on january 15 and july 15 of each year interest on the 2018 senior notes and the 2023 senior notes is payable in cash on april 15 and october 15 of each year interest on the 2025 senior notes is payable in cash on may 1 and november 1 of each year we expect to refinance the 2017 senior notes prior to their maturity utilizing proceeds from one or more of the issuance of additional senior notes revolver borrowings or issuance of cp notes 

  

we may redeem some or all of the senior notes at any time at redemption prices set forth in the senior indenture upon the occurrence of a change of control triggering event which is defined in the senior indenture each holder of our senior notes has the right to require us to repurchase some or all of such holder’s senior notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101 of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest if any to but excluding the repurchase date 

  

the senior indenture contains covenants limiting among other things our ability subject to certain exceptions to consolidate merge or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets and our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur or guarantee indebtedness secured by liens on any shares of voting stock of significant subsidiaries 

  

the senior indenture also provides for events of default which if any of them occurs would permit or require the principal of and accrued interest on our senior notes to become or to be declared due and payable as applicable 

  

rating agencies 

  

on june 1 2016 moody’s investors service upgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to baa2 from baa3 and on august 3 2016 assigned to us a commercial paper rating of p2 and affirmed our existing senior unsecured debt rating of baa2 both with a stable outlook on august 4 2016 standard  poor’s assigned to us a shortterm corporate credit and commercial paper rating of a2 and affirmed our existing longterm corporate credit and senior unsecured rating of bbb all with a stable outlook our current credit ratings as well as future rating agency actions could i impact our ability to finance our operations on satisfactory terms ii affect our financing costs and iii affect our insurance premiums and collateral requirements necessary for our selfinsured programs there can be no assurance that we will maintain or improve our current credit ratings 

  

interest rate swaps 

  

from time to time we use interest rate swaps to minimize the risk of adverse changes in interest rates these swaps are intended to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure because of high correlation between the derivative financial instrument and the underlying exposure being hedged fluctuations in the value of the financial instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying economic exposure our principal interest rate exposure relates to outstanding amounts under our facilities and the cp notes at february 3 2017 and january 29 2016 we had no outstanding interest rate swaps for more information see item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” below 

  

 

contractual obligations 

  

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of february 3 2017 in thousands 

  



  





  



  



  



  



  



  

share repurchase program 

  

on august 24 2016 our board of directors authorized a 10 billion increase to our existing common stock repurchase program which had a total remaining authorization of approximately 933 million at february 3 

 

2017 under the authorization purchases may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time subject to market and other conditions the authorization has no expiration date and may be modified or terminated from time to time at the discretion of our board of directors for more detail about our share repurchase program see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

other considerations 

  

on march 15 2017 the board of directors approved a quarterly cash dividend to shareholders of 026 per share which is payable on april 25 2017 to shareholders of record on april 11 2017 an increase of 001 per share over quarterly dividends paid in 2016 although the board currently intends to continue regular quarterly cash dividends the payment of future cash dividends and the amounts of any such dividends are subject to the board’s discretion and will depend upon among other factors our results of operations cash requirements financial condition contractual restrictions and other factors that our board may deem relevant 

  

our inventory balance represented approximately 53 of our total assets exclusive of goodwill and other intangible assets as of february 3 2017 our ability to effectively manage our inventory balances can have a significant impact on our cash flows from operations during a given fiscal year inventory purchases are often somewhat seasonal in nature such as the purchase of warmweather or christmasrelated merchandise efficient management of our inventory has been and continues to be an area of focus for us 

  

as described in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements we are involved in a number of legal actions and claims some of which could potentially result in material cash payments adverse developments in those actions could materially and adversely affect our liquidity we also have certain income taxrelated contingencies as disclosed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements future negative developments could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity 

  

cash flows 

  

cash flows from operating activities cash flows from operating activities were 16 billion in 2016 an increase of 2134 million compared to 2015 significant components of the increase in cash flows from operating activities in 2016 compared to 2015 include increased net income due primarily to increased sales and operating profit in 2016 as described in more detail above under “results of operations” changes in merchandise inventories resulted in a reduction in working capital usage in 2016 compared to 2015 as described in greater detail below accounts payable increased by 565 million in 2016 compared to a 1056 million increase in 2015 due primarily to the timing of merchandise receipts and related payments which were impacted by increases in payment terms 

  

cash flows from operating activities were 14 billion in 2015 an increase of 648 million compared to 2014 significant components of the increase in cash flows from operating activities in 2015 compared to 2014 include increased net income due primarily to increased sales and operating profit in 2015 as described in more detail above under “results of operations” changes in merchandise inventories resulted in an increased use of working capital growing by a greater amount in 2015 compared to 2014 as described in greater detail below accounts payable increased by 1056 million in 2015 compared to a 972 million increase in 2014 due primarily to the timing of merchandise receipts and related payments 

  

on an ongoing basis we closely monitor and manage our inventory balances and they may fluctuate from period to period based on new store openings the timing of purchases and other factors merchandise inventories increased by 6 in 2016 by 10 in 2015 and by 9 in 2014 inventory levels in the consumables category increased by 545 million or 3 in 2016 by 2184 million or 13 in 2015 and by 1784 million or 12 in 2014 the seasonal category increased by 795 million or 15 in 2016 by 632 million or 13 in 2015 and by 138 million or 3 in 2014 the home products category increased by 408 million or 14 in 2016 by 128 million or 5 in 2015 and was essentially unchanged in 2014 the apparel category increased by 

 

99 million or 3 in 2016 decreased by 27 million or 1 in 2015 and increased by 371 million or 13 in 2014 

  

cash flows from investing activities  significant components of property and equipment purchases in 2016 included the following approximate amounts 201 million for distribution and transportationrelated projects 168 million for improvements upgrades remodels and relocations of existing stores 120 million for new leased stores 38 million for stores purchased or built by us and 26 million for information systems upgrades and technologyrelated projects the timing of new remodeled and relocated store openings along with other factors may affect the relationship between such openings and the related property and equipment purchases in any given period during 2016 we opened 900 new stores and remodeled or relocated 906 stores 

  

significant components of property and equipment purchases in 2015 included the following approximate amounts 168 million for improvements upgrades remodels and relocations of existing stores 144 million for distribution and transportationrelated projects 99 million for new leased stores 53 million for stores built by us and 34 million for information systems upgrades and technologyrelated projects during 2015 we opened 730 new stores and remodeled or relocated 881 stores 

  

significant components of property and equipment purchases in 2014 included the following approximate amounts 127 million for improvements upgrades remodels and relocations of existing stores 102 million for new leased stores 64 million for distribution and transportationrelated projects 38 million for stores built by us and 35 million for information systems upgrades and technologyrelated projects during 2014 we opened 700 new stores and remodeled or relocated 915 stores 

  

capital expenditures during 2017 are projected to be in the range of 650 to 700 million we anticipate funding 2017 capital requirements with existing cash balances cash flows from operations availability under our revolving facility and the issuance of cp notes we plan to continue to invest in store growth and development of approximately 1000 new stores and approximately 900 stores to be remodeled or relocated capital expenditures in 2017 are anticipated to support our store growth as well as our remodel and relocation initiatives including capital outlays for leasehold improvements fixtures and equipment the construction of new stores costs to support and enhance our supply chain initiatives including new and existing distribution center facilities technology initiatives as well as routine and ongoing capital requirements 

  

cash flows from financing activities  in 2016 we repurchased 124 million outstanding shares of our common stock at a total cost of 9905 million net repayments under the 2015 revolving facility during 2016 were 2510 million we had net commercial paper borrowings during 2016 of 4905 million we also paid cash dividends of 2811 million 

  

in 2015 we repurchased 176 million outstanding shares of our common stock at a total cost of 13 billion we made repayments of 5000 million on our term loan facilities and had proceeds of 4992 million from the issuance of senior notes net borrowings under our revolving credit facilities during 2015 were 2510 million we also paid cash dividends of 2583 million 

  

in 2014 we repurchased 141 million outstanding shares of our common stock at a total cost of 8001 million we made repayments of 750 million on our term loan facility borrowings and repayments under our revolving credit facilities during the 2014 period were the same amount resulting in no net increase to amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility during 2014 

  

accounting standards 

  

in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued comprehensive new accounting standards related to the recognition of revenue which specified an effective date for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2016 with early adoption not permitted in august 2015 the fasb deferred the effective date to annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 with earlier adoption 

 

permitted only for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2016 the new guidance allows companies to use either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach in the adoption of this guidance we have formed a project team to assess and implement the standard by compiling a list of the applicable revenue streams evaluating relevant contracts and comparing our current accounting policies to the new standard as a result of the efforts of this project team we have identified customer incentives and gross versus net considerations as the areas in which we could most likely be affected by the new guidance we are continuing to assess all the impacts of the new standard and the design of internal control over financial reporting but based upon the terms of our agreements and the materiality of the transactions related to customer incentives and gross versus net considerations we do not expect the adoption to have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows we expect to complete this work in 2017 and to adopt this guidance on february 3 2018 

  

in february 2016 the fasb issued new guidance related to lease accounting which when effective will require a dual approach for lessee accounting under which a lessee will account for leases as finance leases or operating leases both finance leases and operating leases will result in the lessee recognizing a rightofuse asset and a corresponding lease liability on its balance sheet with differing methodology for income statement recognition this guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2018 and early adoption is permitted a modified retrospective approach is required for all leases existing or entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the consolidated financial statements we are currently assessing the impact that adoption of this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and we are anticipating a material impact because we are party to a significant number of lease contracts 

  

in october 2016 the fasb issued amendments to existing guidance related to accounting for intraentity transfers of assets other than inventory these amendments require an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of such transfers when the transfer occurs and affects our historical accounting for intraentity transfers of certain intangible assets this guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2017 and early adoption is permitted subject to certain guidelines the amendments should be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulativeeffect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption we are currently assessing the impact that adoption of this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements but expect such adoption will result in an increase in deferred income tax liabilities and a decrease in retained earnings 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “us gaap” requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures in addition to the estimates presented below there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed critical as defined below we believe these estimates are reasonable and appropriate however if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used the resulting changes could have a material effect on the financial statements taken as a whole 

  

management believes the following policies and estimates are critical because they involve significant judgments assumptions and estimates management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosures presented below relating to those policies and estimates see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of our principal accounting policies 

  

merchandise inventories  merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market “lcm” with cost determined using the retail last in first out “lifo” method we use the retail inventory method “rim” to calculate gross profit and the resulting valuation of inventories at cost which are computed utilizing a calculated costtoretail inventory ratio at an inventory department level we apply the rim to these departments 

 

which are groups of products that are fairly uniform in terms of cost selling price relationship and turnover the rim will result in valuing inventories at lcm if permanent markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories inherent in the retail inventory method calculation are certain management judgments and estimates that may impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the gross profit recognized these judgments include ensuring departments consist of uniform products recording estimated shrinkage between physical inventories and timely recording of markdowns needed to sell inventory 

  

we perform an annual lifo analysis whereby all merchandise units are considered for inclusion in the index formulation an actual valuation of inventory under the lifo method is made at the end of each year based on the inventory levels and costs at that time in contrast interim lifo calculations are based on management’s annual estimates of sales the rate of inflation or deflation and yearend inventory levels we also perform analyses for determining obsolete inventory adjusting inventory on a quarterly basis to an lcm value based on various management assumptions including estimated below cost markdowns not yet recorded but required to liquidate such inventory in future periods 

  

factors considered in the determination of markdowns include current and anticipated demand based on changes in competitors’ practices consumer preferences consumer spending and unseasonable weather patterns certain of these factors are outside of our control and may result in greater than estimated markdowns to entice consumer purchases of excess inventory the amount and timing of markdowns may vary significantly from year to year 

  

we perform physical inventories in virtually all of our stores on an annual basis we calculate our shrink provision based on actual physical inventory results during the fiscal period and an accrual for estimated shrink occurring subsequent to a physical inventory through the end of the fiscal reporting period this accrual is calculated as a percentage of sales at each retail store at a department level based on the store’s most recent historical shrink rate to the extent that subsequent physical inventories yield different results than the estimated accrual our effective shrink rate for a given reporting period will include the impact of adjusting to the actual results 

  

we believe our estimates and assumptions related to the application of the rim results in a merchandise inventory valuation that reasonably approximates cost on a consistent basis 

  

goodwill and other intangible assets the qualitative and quantitative assessments related to the valuation and any potential impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets are each subject to judgments andor assumptions the analysis of qualitative factors may include determining the appropriate factors to consider and the relative importance of those factors along with other assumptions if required judgments in the quantitative testing process may include projecting future cash flows determining appropriate discount rates correctly applying valuation techniques correctly computing the implied fair value of goodwill if necessary and other assumptions future cash flow projections are based on management’s projections and represent best estimates taking into account recent financial performance market trends strategic plans and other available information which in recent years have been materially accurate changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value or impairment however such a conclusion is not indicated by recent analyses future indicators of impairment could result in an asset impairment charge if these judgments or assumptions are incorrect or flawed the analysis could be negatively impacted 

  

our most recent evaluation of our goodwill and indefinite lived trade name intangible assets was completed during the third quarter of 2016 no indicators of impairment were evident and no assessment of or adjustment to these assets was required we are not currently projecting a decline in cash flows that could be expected to have an adverse effect such as a violation of debt covenants or future impairment charges 

  

property and equipment  property and equipment are recorded at cost we group our assets into relatively homogeneous classes and generally provide for depreciation on a straightline basis over the estimated average useful life of each asset class except for leasehold improvements which are amortized over the lesser of 

 

the applicable lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset certain store and warehouse fixtures when fully depreciated are removed from the cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization accounts the valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of depreciable lives involves judgments and the use of estimates which we believe have been materially accurate in recent years 

  

impairment of longlived assets impairment of longlived assets results when the carrying value of the assets exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows generated by the assets our estimate of undiscounted future store cash flows is based upon historical operations of the stores and estimates of future profitability which encompasses many factors that are subject to variability and are difficult to predict if our estimates of future cash flows are not materially accurate our impairment analysis could be impacted accordingly if a longlived asset is found to be impaired the amount recognized for impairment is equal to the difference between the carrying value and the asset’s estimated fair value the fair value is estimated based primarily upon projected future cash flows discounted at our credit adjusted riskfree rate or other reasonable estimates of fair market value although not currently anticipated changes in these estimates assumptions or projections could materially affect the determination of fair value or impairment 

  

insurance liabilities  we retain a significant portion of the risk for our workers’ compensation employee health property loss automobile and general liability claims these represent significant costs primarily due to our large employee base and number of stores provisions are made for these liabilities on an undiscounted basis certain of these liabilities are based on actual claim data and estimates of incurred but not reported claims developed using actuarial methodologies based on historical claim trends which have been and are anticipated to continue to be materially accurate if future claim trends deviate from recent historical patterns or other unanticipated events affect the number and significance of future claims we may be required to record additional expenses or expense reductions which could be material to our future financial results 

  

contingent liabilities – income taxes income tax reserves are determined using the methodology established by accounting standards relating to uncertainty in income taxes these standards require companies to assess each income tax position taken using a twostep process a determination is first made as to whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained based upon the technical merits upon examination by the taxing authorities if the tax position is expected to meet the more likely than not criteria the benefit recorded for the tax position equals the largest amount that is greater than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement of the respective tax position uncertain tax positions require determinations and liabilities to be estimated based on provisions of the tax law which may be subject to change or varying interpretation if our determinations and estimates prove to be inaccurate the resulting adjustments could be material to our future financial results 

  

contingent liabilities  legal matters    we are subject to legal regulatory and other proceedings and claims we establish liabilities as appropriate for these claims and proceedings based upon the probability and estimability of losses and to fairly present in conjunction with the disclosures of these matters in our financial statements and sec filings management’s view of our exposure we review outstanding claims and proceedings with external counsel to assess probability and estimates of loss which includes an analysis of whether such loss estimates are probable reasonably possible or remote we reevaluate these assessments on a quarterly basis or as new and significant information becomes available to determine whether a liability should be established or if any existing liability should be adjusted the actual cost of resolving a claim or proceeding ultimately may be substantially different than the amount of the recorded liability in addition because it is not permissible under us gaap to establish a litigation liability until the loss is both probable and estimable in some cases there may be insufficient time to establish a liability prior to the actual incurrence of the loss upon verdict and judgment at trial for example or in the case of a quickly negotiated settlement 

  

lease accounting and excess facilities  many of our stores are subject to buildtosuit arrangements with landlords which typically carry a primary lease term of up to 15 years with multiple renewal options we also have stores subject to shorterterm leases and many of these leases have renewal options certain of our stores have provisions for contingent rentals based upon a percentage of defined sales volume we recognize contingent rental expense when the achievement of specified sales targets is considered probable we record minimum rental 

 

expense on a straightline basis over the base noncancelable lease term commencing on the date that we take physical possession of the property from the landlord which normally includes a period prior to store opening to make necessary leasehold improvements and install store fixtures when a lease contains a predetermined fixed escalation of the minimum rent we recognize the related rent expense on a straightline basis and record the difference between the recognized rental expense and the amounts payable under the lease as deferred rent tenant allowances to the extent received are recorded as deferred incentive rent and amortized as a reduction to rent expense over the term of the lease we reflect as a liability any difference between the calculated expense and the amounts actually paid improvements of leased properties are amortized over the shorter of the life of the applicable lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset 

  

sharebased payments  our stock option awards are valued on an individual grant basis using the blackscholesmerton closed form option pricing model we believe that this model fairly estimates the value of our stock option awards the application of this valuation model involves assumptions that are judgmental in the valuation of stock options which affects compensation expense related to these options these assumptions include the term that the options are expected to be outstanding the historical volatility of our stock price applicable interest rates and the dividend yield of our stock other factors involving judgments that affect the expensing of sharebased payments include estimated forfeiture rates of sharebased awards historically these estimates have been materially accurate however if our estimates differ materially from actual experience we may be required to record additional expense or reductions of expense which could be material to our future financial results 

  

fair value measurements accounting standards for the measurement of fair value of assets and liabilities establish a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity observable inputs that are classified within levels 1 and 2 of the hierarchy and the reporting entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions unobservable inputs classified within level 3 of the hierarchy therefore level 3 inputs are typically based on an entity’s own assumptions as there is little if any related market activity and thus require the use of significant judgment and estimates currently we have no assets or liabilities that are valued based solely on level 3 inputs 

  

our fair value measurements are primarily associated with our outstanding debt instruments we use various valuation models in determining the values of these liabilities we believe that in recent years these methodologies have produced materially accurate valuations 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

financial risk management 

  

we are exposed to market risk primarily from adverse changes in interest rates and to a lesser degree commodity prices to minimize this risk we may periodically use financial instruments including derivatives all derivative financial instrument transactions must be authorized and executed pursuant to approval by the board of directors as a matter of policy we do not buy or sell financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes and any such derivative financial instruments are intended to be used to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure our objective is to correlate derivative financial instruments and the underlying exposure being hedged so that fluctuations in the value of the financial instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying economic exposure 

  

interest rate risk 

  

we manage our interest rate risk through the strategic use of fixed and variable interest rate debt and from time to time derivative financial instruments our principal interest rate exposure relates to outstanding amounts under our unsecured debt facilities as well as our commercial paper program as of february 3 2017 we had variable rate borrowings of 425 million under our 2015 term facility borrowings of 4905 million under our commercial paper program and no borrowings outstanding under our 2015 revolving facility in order to mitigate a portion of the variable rate interest exposure under the credit facilities in prior years we have entered into various interest rate swaps as of february 3 2017 no such interest rate swaps were outstanding and as a result we are exposed to fluctuations in variable interest rates under the credit facilities and our commercial paper program for a detailed discussion of our credit facilities and our commercial paper program see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

a change in interest rates on variable rate debt impacts our pretax earnings and cash flows whereas a change in interest rates on fixed rate debt impacts the economic fair value of debt but not our pretax earnings and cash flows based on our variable rate borrowing levels as of february 3 2017 and january 29 2016 the annualized effect of a one percentage point increase in variable interest rates would have resulted in a pretax reduction of our earnings and cash flows of approximately 92 million in 2016 and 69 million in 2015

 item 9a controls and procedures 

  

a disclosure controls and procedures under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined under rule 13a‑15e or 15d‑15e promulgated under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” based on this evaluation our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report 

  

b management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting our management prepared and is responsible for the consolidated financial statements and all related financial information contained in this report this responsibility includes establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a‑15f or 15d‑15f under the exchange act our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles 

  

to comply with the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanes‑oxley act of 2002 management designed and implemented a structured and comprehensive assessment process to evaluate the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting such assessment was based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework 2013 framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission because of its inherent limitations a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements management regularly monitors our internal control over financial reporting and actions are taken to correct any deficiencies as they are identified based on its assessment management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as of february 3 2017

dollar general corporation 

  

we have audited dollar general corporation and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of february 3 2017 based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 2013 framework the coso criteria dollar general corporation and subsidiaries’ management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

  

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

  

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

in our opinion dollar general corporation and subsidiaries maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of february 3 2017 based on the coso criteria 

  

we also have audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated balance sheets of dollar general corporation and subsidiaries as of february 3 2017 and january 29 2016 and the related consolidated statements of income comprehensive income shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended february 3 2017 of dollar general corporation and subsidiaries and our report dated march 24 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon

general 

we are the largest discount retailer in the united states by number of stores with 9961 stores located in 39 states as of march 2 2012 primarily in the southern southwestern midwestern and eastern united states we offer a broad selection of merchandise including consumables seasonal home products and apparel our merchandise includes high quality national brands from leading manufacturers as well as comparable quality private brand selections with prices at substantial discounts to national brands we offer our merchandise at everyday low prices typically 10 or less through our convenient smallbox approximately 7200 square feet locations 

our history 

jl turner founded our company in 1939 as jl turner and son wholesale we were incorporated as a kentucky corporation under the name jl turner  son inc in 1955 when we opened our first dollar general store we changed our name to dollar general corporation in 1968 and reincorporated in 1998 as a tennessee corporation our common stock was publicly traded from 1968 until july 2007 when we merged with an entity controlled by investment funds affiliated with kohlberg kravis roberts  co lp or kkr in november 2009 our common stock again became publicly traded buck holdings lp a delaware limited partnership controlled by kkr continues to beneficially own a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock 

our business model 

our long history of profitable growth is founded on a commitment to a relatively simple business model providing a broad base of customers with their basic everyday and household needs supplemented with a variety of general merchandise items at everyday low prices in conveniently located smallbox stores we continually evaluate the needs and demands of our customers and modify our merchandise selections and pricing accordingly while remaining focused on increasing profitability for our shareholders 

fiscal year 2011 represented our 22 nd consecutive year of samestore sales growth this growth regardless of economic conditions suggests that we have a less cyclical model than most retailers and we believe is a result of our compelling value and convenience proposition 

our attractive store economics including a relatively low initial investment and simple low cost operating model have allowed us to grow our store base to current levels and provide us significant opportunities to continue our profitable store growth strategy 

compelling value and convenience proposition our ability to deliver highly competitive prices on national brand and quality private brand products in convenient locations and our easy in and out shopping format create a compelling shopping experience that distinguishes us from other discount convenience and drugstore retailers our slogan save time save money every day summarizes our appeal to customers we believe our ability to effectively deliver both value and convenience allows us to succeed in small markets with limited shopping alternatives as well as to profitably coexist alongside larger retailers in more competitive markets our compelling value and convenience proposition is evidenced by the following attributes of our business model 

• convenient locations our stores are conveniently located in a variety of rural suburban and urban communities currently with approximately 70 serving communities with populations of less than 20000 in more densely populated areas our smallbox stores typically serve the closely surrounding neighborhoods the majority of our customers live within three to five miles or a 2 

10minute drive of our stores our close proximity to customers drives customer loyalty and trip frequency and makes us an attractive alternative to large discount and other largebox retail and grocery stores which are often located farther away our low cost economic model enables us to serve many areas with fewer than 1500 households 

• timesaving shopping experience we also provide customers with a highly convenient shopping experience our stores smaller size allows us to locate parking near the front entrance our product offering includes most necessities such as basic packaged and refrigerated food and dairy products cleaning supplies paper products and health and beauty care items as well as greeting cards party supplies apparel housewares hardware and automotive supplies among others our typical store opens at 800 am and closes at 900 pm or 1000 pm seven days per week our convenient hours and broad merchandise offering allow our customers to fulfill their routine shopping requirements and minimize their need to shop elsewhere • everyday low prices on quality merchandise our research indicates that we offer a price advantage over most food and drug retailers and that our prices are highly competitive with even the largest discount retailers our ability to offer everyday low prices on quality merchandise is supported by our lowcost operating structure and our strategy to maintain a limited number of stock keeping units skus per category which we believe helps us maintain strong purchasing power most items are priced below 10 with approximately 25 at 1 or less we offer quality nationally advertised brands at these everyday low prices in addition to offering our own comparable quality private brands at value prices attractive store economics the traditional dollar general store size design and location requires minimal initial capital investment and low maintenance expenditures our typical locations involve a modest nofrills building which helps keep our rental and other fixed overhead costs relatively low our leased stores generally deliver positive cash flow in their first year of operations typically resulting in pay back of capital in less than two years our stringent market analysis real estate site selection and new store approval processes as well as our new store marketing programs help us optimize financial returns and minimize the risks of opening unprofitable stores 

our lean store staffing model and centralized management of utilities maintenance and supplies procurement contribute to our relatively low operating costs and efficient store operations recent additions and upgrades to technology in our stores including highspeed data transmission inventory control workforce management and task management systems are enabling us to manage our store operations even more effectively 

substantial growth opportunities we believe we have the longterm potential in the us to more than double our existing store base while maintaining strong returns on capital we have identified significant opportunities to add new stores in both existing and new markets in addition we have opportunities within our existing store base to relocate or remodel to better serve our customers see our growth strategy for additional details 

our growth strategy 

we believe we have the right strategy and execution capabilities to capitalize on the considerable growth opportunities afforded by our business model we believe we continue to have significant opportunities to drive profitable growth through increasing samestore sales expanding our operating profit rate and growing our store base 

increasing samestore sales we believe the combination of our necessitydriven product mix and our attractive value proposition including a wellbalanced merchandising approach provides a strong basis for increased sales our average sales per square foot increased to 213 in 2011 including a 4 contribution from the 53 rd week from 201 in 2010 and 195 in 2009 we believe we will continue to 

have additional opportunities to increase our store productivity through improved instock positions price optimization continued improvements in space utilization and additional operating and merchandising initiatives including further expansion of our frozen and refrigerated food offerings 

we remodeled or relocated 575 stores in 2011 and we plan to relocate or remodel 550 stores in 2012 remodels and relocations typically drive incremental samestore sales growth a relocation typically results in an improved more visible and accessible location and usually includes increased square footage we believe we will continue to have opportunities for additional remodels and relocations beyond 2012 

expanding operating profit rate another key component of our growth strategy is improving our operating profit rate through enhanced gross profit and expense reduction initiatives even though we faced challenges in 2011 resulting from ongoing pressures with regard to discretionary spending and significant increases in product costs we were able to increase our operating profit by 17 equal to 30 basis points as a percent of sales primarily due to our ongoing efforts to reduce selling general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales 

we remain committed to an everyday low price edlp strategy that our customers can depend on to strengthen our adherence to this strategy and still protect gross profit we utilize various pricing and merchandising options including price optimization strategies changes to our product selection such as alternate national brands and the expansion of our private brands and modifications to our packaging and product size in 2011 the cost of many basic commodities including cotton sugar coffee groundnuts and resin as well as transportation fuel increased and many of these increases were passed along to us by our vendors these cost increases posed a challenge to our continued priority of improving our gross profit rate in 2011 

our private brand program complements our model of offering customers nationally branded consumables merchandise at everyday low prices when compared to similar national brands private or proprietary brand items generally have higher gross profit rates the addition of private brands also allows us to better control quality and improve our packaging and shelf presentation over less recognizable packer labels over the past few years we have expanded our private brand initiative to our nonconsumable offerings dramatically improving the visual impact of many of our nonconsumables including housewares domestics lawn and garden tools and summer toys 

in addition in 2010 and 2011 we increased our offering of items at the 100 price point focusing first on food followed by health and beauty because we believe this program adds incremental sales and gross profit we plan to further this program in 2012 continuing to combine some of our 100 edlp items with special purchases 

improving our inventory shrinkage has been and continues to be an important component of expanding our gross profit rate to achieve this objective we have concentrated our shrink reduction efforts on stores with the highest shrink rates in addition we have been successful in employing exception reporting tools and enhanced shrink optimization processes 

we also continue to believe we have the potential to directly source a larger portion of our products internationally at significant savings to current costs in 2011 we imported approximately 780 million of goods or 8 of total purchases at cost 

we continually look for ways to improve our cost structure and enhance efficiencies throughout the organization for example in 2011 we fully implemented a store workforce management program and made further progress on reducing costs through our energy management and centralized procurement systems 

growing our store base based on a detailed marketbymarket analysis we believe we have the potential to at least double our current number of stores through expansion in both existing and new markets in 2011 we made our initial entrance into connecticut new hampshire and nevada our first new states since 2006 and in 2012 we plan to open approximately 50 stores in california we have confidence in our real estate disciplines and in our ability to identify open and operate successful new stores as a result we believe that at least our present level of new store growth is sustainable for the foreseeable future 

our merchandise 

we offer a focused assortment of everyday necessities which drive frequent customer visits and key items in a broad range of general merchandise categories our product assortment provides the opportunity for our customers to address most of their basic shopping needs with one trip we sell high quality national brands from leading manufacturers such as procter  gamble kimberly clark unilever kelloggs general mills nabisco cocacola and pepsico which are typically found at higher retail prices elsewhere additionally our private brand consumables offer consumers even greater value with options to purchase value items and national brand equivalent products at substantial discounts to the national brand 

our stores generally offer approximately 10000 total skus per store however the number of skus in a given store can vary based upon the stores size geographic location merchandising initiatives seasonality and other factors most of our products are priced at 10 or less with approximately 25 at 1 or less we separate our merchandise into four categories 1 consumables 2 seasonal 3 home products and 4 apparel 

consumables is our largest category and includes paper and cleaning products such as paper towels bath tissue paper dinnerware trash and storage bags laundry and other home cleaning supplies food including packaged food and perishables such as cereals canned soups and vegetables sugar flour milk eggs and bread beverages and snacks including candy cookies crackers salty snacks and carbonated beverages health and beauty including overthecounter medicines and personal care products such as soap body wash shampoo dental hygiene and foot care products and pet including pet supplies and pet food 

seasonal products include decorations toys batteries small electronics greeting cards stationery prepaid cell phones and accessories gardening supplies hardware automotive and home office supplies 

home products includes kitchen supplies cookware small appliances light bulbs storage containers frames candles craft supplies and kitchen bed and bath soft goods 

apparel includes casual everyday apparel for infants toddlers girls boys women and men as well as socks underwear disposable diapers shoes and accessories 

the percentage of net sales of each of our four categories of merchandise for the fiscal years indicated below was as follows 



our home products and seasonal categories typically account for the highest gross profit margins and the consumables category typically accounts for the lowest gross profit margin 

the dollar general store 

the average dollar general store has approximately 7200 square feet of selling space and is typically operated by a store manager an assistant store manager and three or more sales clerks approximately 60 of our stores are in freestanding buildings and 40 are in strip shopping centers most of our customers live within three to five miles or a 10 minute drive of our stores our traditional store strategy features low initial capital expenditures limited maintenance capital low occupancy and operating costs and a focused merchandise offering within a broad range of categories allowing us to deliver low retail prices while generating strong cash flows and investment returns in 2011 the average cost of equipment and fixtures in our traditional leased stores was approximately 180000 initial inventory net of payables increases the investment in a new store by approximately 75000 

we generally have had good success in locating suitable store sites in the past given the size of the communities that we target we believe that there is ample opportunity for new store growth in existing and new markets in addition the current real estate market has continued to provide opportunities for us to access higher quality sites at lower rates than in recent years also we believe we have significant opportunities available for our relocation and remodel programs we spend approximately 80000 for equipment and fixtures to remodel a traditional store and approximately 160000 to relocate a traditional store we remodeled or relocated 575 stores in 2011 504 in 2010 and 450 in 2009 

at the end of 2011 our total store count included 69 dollar general market stores which in addition to the merchandise offering of a traditional dollar general store feature an expanded food section including fresh meat and produce and significantly more frozen and refrigerated foods these stores which average approximately 16000 square feet of selling space are an alternative to the typical grocery store or supermarket and generally contribute more to sales and operating income than our traditional stores in 2011 we opened 12 new dollar general markets including seven as part of our initial entrance into nevada we plan to open approximately 40 new dollar general markets in 2012 including a significant percentage of our initial stores in california our focus is on locating the dollar general market stores in areas that are generally underserved by large grocery chains we continue to test and adjust the dollar general market concept and how we build and open the stores as the capital investment for these stores is significantly higher than our traditional stores in addition to the market stores we are also testing a larger format traditional store with approximately 10000 square feet of selling space including an expanded section of coolers and freezers like the dollar general market stores these larger format stores currently require significantly higher capital investment than our traditional stores and we are working to reduce that difference 

our recent store growth is summarized in the following table 



our customers 

our customers seek value and convenience depending on their financial situation and geographic proximity customers reliance on dollar general varies from using dollar general for fillin shopping to making periodic trips to stock up on household items to making weekly or more frequent trips to meet most essential needs we believe that our value and convenience proposition attracts customers from a wide range of income brackets and life stages in the last year we have continued to see 

increases in the annual number of shopping trips that our customers make to our stores as well as the amount spent during each trip 

to attract new and retain existing customers we continue to focus on product quality and selection instock levels and pricing targeted advertising improved store standards convenient site locations and a pleasant overall customer experience 

our suppliers 

we purchase merchandise from a wide variety of suppliers and maintain direct buying relationships with many producers of national brand merchandise such as procter  gamble kimberly clark unilever kelloggs general mills nabisco cocacola and pepsico despite our broad offering we maintain only a limited number of skus per category giving us a pricing advantage in dealing with our suppliers approximately 8 and 7 of our purchases in 2011 were from our largest and second largest suppliers respectively our private brands come from a diversified supplier base we directly imported approximately 8 of our purchases at cost 12 of our purchases based on their retail value in 2011 our vendor arrangements generally provide for payment for such merchandise in us dollars 

we have consistently managed to obtain sufficient quantities of core merchandise and believe that if one or more of our current sources of supply became unavailable we would generally be able to obtain alternative sources without experiencing a substantial disruption of our business however such alternative sources could increase our merchandise costs or reduce the quality of our merchandise and an inability to obtain alternative sources could adversely affect our sales 

distribution transportation and inventory management 

our stores are currently supported by ten distribution centers located strategically throughout our geographic footprint including a new distribution center in bessemer alabama which began shipping to stores on march 11 2012 we lease additional temporary warehouse space as necessary to support our distribution needs in addition we have leased a distribution facility in lebec california which we expect to be operational in april 2012 over the past few years we have made significant investments in facilities technological improvements and upgrades and we continue to improve work processes all of which increase our efficiency and ability to support our merchandising and operations initiatives as well as our new store growth we continually analyze and rebalance the network to ensure that it remains efficient and provides the service our stores require see —properties for additional information pertaining to our distribution centers 

most of our merchandise flows through our distributions centers and is delivered to our stores by thirdparty trucking firms utilizing our trailers our agreements with these trucking firms are based on estimated costs of diesel fuel with the difference in estimated and current market fuel costs passed through to us the costs of diesel fuel are significantly influenced by international political and economic circumstances and were considerably higher throughout 2011 than in 2010 if such increased prices remain in effect or if further price increases were to arise for any reason including fuel supply shortages or unusual price volatility the resulting higher fuel prices could materially increase our transportation costs 

we believe that there remains opportunity to improve our inventory turns initiatives in process include operational efforts to optimize presentation levels improve instock levels and decrease excess quantities shipped to our stores we continue to focus on sku optimization in an attempt to ensure that we can meet customers demands for our most popular products as well as ensure appropriate product assortment we are also in the process of implementing an improved supply chain solution to assist in ordering monitoring and tracking inventory from purchase order to receipt to maintain efficient levels of inventory we turned our inventory approximately 53 times over the most recent four quarters 

seasonality 

our business is seasonal to a certain extent generally our highest sales volume occurs in the fourth quarter which includes the christmas selling season and the lowest occurs in the first quarter in addition our quarterly results can be affected by the timing of certain holidays the timing of new store openings and store closings the amount of sales contributed by new and existing stores as well as financial transactions such as debt repurchases common stock offerings and stock repurchases we purchase substantial amounts of inventory in the third quarter and incur higher shipping costs and higher payroll costs in anticipation of the increased sales activity during the fourth quarter in addition we carry merchandise during our fourth quarter that we do not carry during the rest of the year such as gift sets holiday decorations certain baking items and a broader assortment of toys and candy 

the following table reflects the seasonality of net sales gross profit and net income by quarter for each of the quarters of our three most recent fiscal years the fourth quarter of the year ended february 3 2012 was comprised of 14 weeks and each of the other quarters reflected below were comprised of 13 weeks 



a includes expenses net of income taxes of 354 million related to the redemption of longterm obligations in second quarter of 2011 b includes expenses net of income taxes of 829 million related to our initial public offering during the fourth quarter of 2009 

our competition 

we operate in the basic discount consumer goods market which is highly competitive with respect to price store location merchandise quality assortment and presentation instock consistency and customer service we compete with discount stores and with many other retailers including mass merchandise grocery drug convenience variety and other specialty stores these other retail companies operate stores in many of the areas where we operate and many of them engage in extensive advertising and marketing efforts our direct competitors include family dollar dollar tree freds 99 cents only and various local independent operators as well as walmart target walgreens cvs and rite aid among others certain of our competitors have greater financial distribution marketing and other resources than we do 

we differentiate ourselves from other forms of retailing by offering consistently low prices in a convenient smallstore format we believe that our prices are competitive due in part to our low cost operating structure and the relatively limited assortment of products offered historically we have 

minimized labor by offering fewer price points and a reliance on simple merchandise presentation purchasing large volumes of merchandise within our focused assortment in each merchandise category allows us to keep our average costs low contributing to our ability to offer competitive everyday low prices to our customers see —our business model above for further discussion of our competitive situation 

our employees 

as of march 2 2012 we employed approximately 90000 fulltime and parttime employees including divisional and regional managers district managers store managers other store personnel and distribution center and administrative personnel we have increasingly focused on recruiting training motivating and retaining employees and we believe that the quality performance and morale of our employees have increased as a result we currently are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements

we believe that many of our customers are on fixed or low incomes and generally have limited discretionary spending dollars a further slowdown in the economy or a delayed recovery or other economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as increased unemployment or underemployment levels inflation increases in fuel or other energy costs and interest rates lack of available credit consumer debt levels higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws and further erosion in consumer confidence may adversely affect our business by reducing our customers spending or by causing them to shift their spending to products other than those sold by us or to products sold by us that are less profitable than other product choices all of which could result in lower net sales decreases in inventory turnover greater markdowns on inventory and a reduction in profitability due to lower margins many of those factors as well as commodity rates transportation costs including the costs of diesel fuel costs of labor insurance and healthcare foreign exchange rate fluctuations lease costs measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade changes in other laws and regulations and other economic factors also affect our cost of goods sold and our selling general and administrative expenses which may adversely affect our sales or profitability we have limited or no ability to control many of these factors product costs began to escalate in our 2010 fourth quarter as a result of increases in the costs of certain commodities including cotton sugar coffee groundnuts resin and increasing diesel fuel costs we will be diligent in our efforts to keep product costs as low as possible in the face of these increases while still working to optimize gross profit and meet the needs of our customers 

in addition many of the factors discussed above along with current global economic conditions and uncertainties the potential for additional failures or realignments of financial institutions and the related impact on available credit may affect us and our suppliers and other business partners landlords and service providers in an adverse manner including but not limited to reducing access to liquid funds or credit increasing the cost of credit limiting our ability to manage interest rate risk increasing the risk of bankruptcy of our suppliers landlords or counterparties to or other financial institutions involved in our credit facilities and our derivative and other contracts increasing the cost of goods to us and other adverse consequences which we are unable to fully anticipate or control 

  our plans depend significantly on initiatives designed to increase sales and improve the efficiencies costs and effectiveness of our operations and failure to achieve or sustain these plans could affect our performance adversely 

we have initiatives such as those relating to marketing merchandising promotions sourcing shrink private brand store operations and real estate in various stages of testing evaluation and implementation upon which we expect to rely to continue to improve our results of operations and financial condition and to achieve our financial plans these initiatives are inherently risky and uncertain even when tested successfully in their application to our business in general it is possible 

that successful testing can result partially from resources and attention that cannot be duplicated in broader implementation particularly in light of the diverse geographic locations of our stores and the fact that our field management is so decentralized general implementation also may be negatively affected by other risk factors described herein successful systemwide implementation relies on consistency of training stability of workforce ease of execution and the absence of offsetting factors that can influence results adversely failure to achieve successful implementation of our initiatives or the cost of these initiatives exceeding managements estimates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

in addition the success of our merchandising initiatives particularly those with respect to nonconsumable merchandise depends in part upon our ability to predict consistently and successfully the products our customers will demand and to identify and timely respond to evolving trends in demographics and consumer preferences expectations and needs if we are unable to select products that are attractive to customers to obtain such products at costs that allow us to sell them at a profit or to effectively market such products our sales market share and profitability could be adversely affected if our merchandising efforts in the nonconsumables area are unsuccessful we could be further adversely affected by our inability to offset the lower margins associated with our consumables business 

  we face intense competition that could limit our growth opportunities and adversely impact our financial performance 

the retail business is highly competitive we operate in the basic discount consumer goods market which is competitive with respect to price store location merchandise quality assortment and presentation instock consistency and customer service this competitive environment subjects us to the risk of adverse impact to our financial performance because of the lower prices and thus the lower margins required to maintain our competitive position also companies like ours operating in the basic discount consumer goods market due to customer demographics and other factors may have limited ability to increase prices in response to increased costs without losing competitive position this limitation may adversely affect our margins and financial performance we compete for customers employees store sites products and services and in other important aspects of our business with many other local regional and national retailers we compete with retailers operating discount mass merchandise outlet warehouse club grocery drug convenience variety and other specialty stores certain of our competitors have greater financial distribution marketing and other resources than we do and may be able to secure better arrangements with suppliers than we can these other competitors compete in a variety of other ways including aggressive promotional activities merchandise selection and availability services offered to customers location store hours instore amenities and price if we fail to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets it could adversely affect our financial performance 

competition for customers has intensified in recent years as larger competitors have moved into or increased their presence in our geographic markets in addition some of our large box competitors are or may be developing small box formats which may produce more competition we remain vulnerable to the marketing power and high level of consumer recognition of these larger competitors and to the risk that these competitors or others could venture into our industry in a significant way generally we expect an increase in competition 

  our private brands may not achieve or maintain broad market acceptance and increase the risks we face 

we have substantially increased the number of our private brand items and the program is a sizable part of our future growth plans we believe that our success in gaining and maintaining broad market acceptance of our private brands depends on many factors including pricing our costs quality and customer perception we may not achieve or maintain our expected sales for our private brands 

as a result our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

  a significant disruption to our distribution network or to the timely receipt of inventory could adversely impact sales or increase our transportation costs which would decrease our profits 

we rely on our distribution and transportation network to provide goods to our stores in a timely and costeffective manner through deliveries to our distribution centers from vendors and then from the distribution centers or direct ship vendors to our stores by various means of transportation including shipments by sea and truck any disruption unanticipated expense or operational failure related to this process could affect store operations negatively for example unexpected delivery delays or increases in transportation costs including through increased fuel costs or a decrease in transportation capacity for overseas shipments could significantly decrease our ability to make sales and earn profits in addition labor shortages or work stoppages in the transportation industry or longterm disruptions to the national and international transportation infrastructure that lead to delays or interruptions of deliveries could negatively affect our business 

we maintain a network of distribution facilities and have plans to build new facilities to support our growth objectives delays in opening distribution centers could adversely affect our future operations by slowing store growth which may in turn reduce revenue growth in addition distributionrelated construction or expansion projects entail risks which could cause delays and cost overruns such as shortages of materials shortages of skilled labor or work stoppages unforeseen construction scheduling engineering environmental or geological problems weather interference fires or other casualty losses and unanticipated cost increases the completion date and ultimate cost of future projects could differ significantly from initial expectations due to constructionrelated or other reasons we cannot guarantee that any project will be completed on time or within established budgets 

  rising fuel costs could materially adversely affect our business 

fuel prices have risen considerably and are significantly influenced by international political and economic circumstances these increases pose a challenge to our continued priority of improving our gross profit rate if such increased prices remain in effect or if further price increases were to arise for any reason including fuel supply shortages or unusual price volatility the resulting higher fuel prices could materially increase our transportation costs adversely affecting our gross profit and results of operations in addition competitive pressures in our industry may have the effect of inhibiting our ability to reflect these increased costs in the prices of our products we will be diligent in our efforts to keep product costs as low as possible in the face of these increases while still working to optimize gross profit and meet the needs of our customers 

  risks associated with or faced by the domestic and foreign suppliers from whom our products are sourced could adversely affect our financial performance 

the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers in fact our largest supplier accounted for 8 of our purchases in 2011 and our next largest supplier accounted for approximately 7 of such purchases we have not experienced any difficulty in obtaining sufficient quantities of core merchandise and believe that if one or more of our current sources of supply became unavailable we would generally be able to obtain alternative sources without experiencing a substantial disruption of our business however such alternative sources could increase our merchandise costs and reduce the quality of our merchandise and an inability to obtain alternative sources could adversely affect our sales 

we directly imported approximately 8 of our purchases measured at cost in 2011 but many of our domestic vendors directly import their products or components of their products changes to the 

prices and flow of these goods for any reason such as political and economic instability in the countries in which foreign suppliers are located the financial instability of suppliers suppliers failure to meet our standards issues with labor practices of our suppliers or labor problems they may experience such as strikes the availability and cost of raw materials to suppliers merchandise quality or safety issues currency exchange rates transport availability and cost inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located or from which they import are beyond our control and could adversely affect our operations and profitability because a substantial amount of our imported merchandise comes from china a change in the chinese currency or other policies could negatively impact our merchandise costs in addition the united states foreign trade policies tariffs and other impositions on imported goods trade sanctions imposed on certain countries the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control disruptions due to labor stoppages strikes or slowdowns or other disruptions involving our vendors or the transportation and handling industries also may negatively affect our ability to receive merchandise and thus may negatively affect sales these and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our financial performance as we increase our imports of merchandise from foreign vendors the risks associated with foreign imports will increase 

  product liability and food safety claims could adversely affect our business reputation and financial performance 

despite our best efforts to ensure the quality and safety of the products we sell we may be subject to product liability claims from customers or penalties from government agencies relating to products including food products that are recalled defective or otherwise alleged to be harmful such claims may result from tampering by unauthorized third parties product contamination or spoilage including the presence of foreign objects substances chemicals other agents or residues introduced during the growing storage handling and transportation phases all of our vendors and their products must comply with applicable product and food safety laws we generally seek contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from our suppliers however if we do not have adequate contractual indemnification andor insurance available such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations our ability to obtain indemnification from foreign suppliers may be hindered by the manufacturers lack of understanding of us product liability or other laws which may make it more likely that we be required to respond to claims or complaints from customers as if we were the manufacturer of the products even with adequate insurance and indemnification such claims could significantly damage our reputation and consumer confidence in our products our litigation expenses could increase as well which also could have a materially negative impact on our results of operations even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued 

  we are subject to governmental regulations procedures and requirements a significant change in or noncompliance with these regulations could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance 

our business is subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations we routinely incur costs in complying with these regulations new laws or regulations particularly those dealing with healthcare reform product safety and labor and employment among others or changes in existing laws and regulations particularly those governing the sale of products may result in significant added expenses or may require extensive system and operating changes that may be difficult to implement andor could materially increase our cost of doing business in addition such changes or new laws may require the write off and disposal of existing product inventory resulting in significant adverse financial impact to us untimely compliance or noncompliance with applicable regulations or untimely or incomplete execution of a required product recall can result in the imposition of penalties including loss of licenses or significant fines or monetary penalties in addition to reputational damage 

  litigation may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business is subject to the risk of litigation by employees consumers suppliers competitors shareholders government agencies and others through private actions class actions administrative proceedings regulatory actions or other litigation the number of employmentrelated class actions filed each year has continued to increase and recent changes and proposed changes in federal and state laws may cause claims to rise even more the outcome of litigation particularly class action lawsuits regulatory actions and intellectual property claims is difficult to assess or quantify plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to these lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time in addition certain of these lawsuits if decided adversely to us or settled by us may result in liability material to our financial statements as a whole or may negatively affect our operating results if changes to our business operations are required the cost to defend future litigation may be significant there also may be adverse publicity associated with litigation that could negatively affect customer perception of our business regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable as a result litigation may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding certain of these pending matters 

  if we cannot open new stores profitably and on schedule our planned future growth will be impeded which would adversely affect sales 

our ability to open profitable new stores is a key component of our planned future growth our ability to timely open such stores and to expand into additional market areas depends in part on the following factors the availability of attractive store locations the absence of occupancy delays the ability to negotiate acceptable lease and development terms the ability to hire and train new personnel especially store managers in a cost effective manner the ability to identify customer demand in different geographic areas general economic conditions and the availability of sufficient funds for expansion many of these factors affect our ability to successfully relocate stores as well and many of them are beyond our control in addition tighter lending practices may make financing more challenging for our real estate developers which could potentially impact the timing of our store openings and buildtosuit program 

delays or failures in opening new stores or achieving lower than expected sales in new stores or drawing a greater than expected proportion of sales in new stores away from existing stores could materially adversely affect our growth andor profitability in addition we may not anticipate all of the challenges imposed by the expansion of our operations and as a result may not meet our targets for opening new stores remodeling or relocating stores or expanding profitably 

some of our new stores may be located in areas where we have little or no meaningful experience or brand recognition those markets may have different competitive conditions market conditions consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns than our existing markets which may cause our new stores to be less successful than stores in our existing markets in addition our alternative format stores such as our dollar general market concept have significantly higher capital costs than our traditional dollar general stores and as a result may increase our financial risk if they do not perform as expected 

many of our new stores will be located in areas where we have existing units although we have experience in these markets increasing the number of locations in these markets may result in inadvertent oversaturation of markets and temporarily or permanently divert customers and sales from our existing stores thereby adversely affecting our overall financial performance 

  natural disasters whether or not caused by climate change unusual weather conditions pandemic outbreaks terrorist acts and global political events could cause permanent or temporary distribution center or store closures impair our ability to purchase receive or replenish inventory or decrease customer traffic all of which could result in lost sales and otherwise adversely affect our financial performance 

the occurrence of one or more natural disasters such as hurricanes fires floods and earthquakes whether or not caused by climate change solar flares unusual weather conditions pandemic outbreaks terrorist acts or disruptive global political events such as civil unrest in countries in which our suppliers are located or similar disruptions could adversely affect our operations and financial performance to the extent these events result in the closure of one or more of our distribution centers a significant number of stores or our corporate headquarters or impact one or more of our key suppliers our operations and financial performance could be materially adversely affected through an inability to make deliveries or provide other support functions to our stores and through lost sales in addition these events could result in increases in fuel or other energy prices or a fuel shortage delays in opening new stores the temporary lack of an adequate work force in a market the temporary or longterm disruption in the supply of products from some domestic and overseas suppliers the temporary disruption in the transport of goods from overseas delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution centers or stores the temporary reduction in the availability of products in our stores and disruption of our utility services or to our information systems these events also can have indirect consequences such as increases in the costs of insurance if they result in significant loss of property or other insurable damage 

  material damage or interruptions to our information systems as a result of external factors staffing shortages and unanticipated challenges or difficulties in updating our existing technology or developing or implementing new technology could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 

we depend on a variety of information technology systems for the efficient functioning of our business such systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches and natural disasters damage or interruption to these systems may require a significant investment to fix or replace them and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim any material interruptions may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 

we also rely heavily on our information technology staff failure to meet these staffing needs may negatively affect our ability to fulfill our technology initiatives while continuing to provide maintenance on existing systems we rely on certain vendors to maintain and periodically upgrade many of these systems so that they can continue to support our business the software programs supporting many of our systems were licensed to us by independent software developers the inability of these developers or us to continue to maintain and upgrade these information systems and software programs would disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations if we were unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner in addition costs and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology or with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems could also disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations 

  failure to attract and retain qualified employees particularly field store and distribution center managers and to control labor costs as well as other labor issues could adversely affect our financial performance 

our future growth and performance depends on our ability to attract retain and motivate qualified employees many of whom are in positions with historically high rates of turnover such as field managers and distribution center managers our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling our labor costs is subject to many external factors including competition for and availability of qualified personnel in a given market unemployment levels within those markets prevailing wage rates 

minimum wage laws health and other insurance costs and changes in employment and labor laws including changes in the process for our employees to join a union or other workplace regulation including changes in entitlement programs such as health insurance and paid leave programs to the extent a significant portion of our employee base unionizes or attempts to unionize our labor costs could increase in addition we are evaluating the potential future impact of recently enacted comprehensive healthcare reform legislation which will likely cause our healthcare costs to increase while the significant costs of the healthcare reform legislation will occur after 2013 if at all due to provisions of the legislation being phased in over time changes to our healthcare costs structure could have a significant negative effect on our business our ability to pass along labor costs to our customers is constrained by our low price model 

  our profitability may be negatively affected by inventory shrinkage 

we are subject to the risk of inventory loss and theft we experience significant inventory shrinkage and we cannot assure you that incidences of inventory loss and theft will decrease in the future or that the measures we are taking will effectively reduce the problem of inventory shrinkage although some level of inventory shrinkage is an unavoidable cost of doing business if we were to experience higher rates of inventory shrinkage or incur increased security costs to combat inventory theft our financial condition could be affected adversely 

  our cash flows from operations may be negatively affected if we are not successful in managing our inventory balances 

our inventory balance represented approximately 49 of our total assets exclusive of goodwill and other intangible assets as of february 3 2012 efficient inventory management is a key component of our business success and profitability to be successful we must maintain sufficient inventory levels to meet our customers demands without allowing those levels to increase to such an extent that the costs to store and hold the goods unduly impacts our financial results if our buying decisions do not accurately predict customer trends or purchasing actions we may have to take unanticipated markdowns to dispose of the excess inventory which also can adversely impact our financial results we continue to focus on ways to reduce these risks but we cannot assure you that we will be successful in our inventory management if we are not successful in managing our inventory balances our cash flows from operations may be negatively affected 

  because our business is seasonal to a certain extent with the highest volume of net sales during the fourth quarter adverse events during the fourth quarter could materially affect our financial statements as a whole 

we generally recognize our highest volume of net sales during the christmas selling season which occurs in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year in anticipation of this holiday we purchase substantial amounts of seasonal inventory and hire many temporary employees an excess of seasonal merchandise inventory could result if our net sales during the christmas selling season were to fall below either seasonal norms or expectations if our fourth quarter sales results were substantially below expectations our financial performance and operating results could be adversely affected by unanticipated markdowns especially in seasonal merchandise lower than anticipated sales in the christmas selling season would also negatively affect our ability to absorb the increased seasonal labor costs 

  our current insurance program may expose us to unexpected costs and negatively affect our financial performance 

our insurance coverage reflects deductibles selfinsured retentions limits of liability and similar provisions that we believe are prudent based on the dispersion of our operations however there are types of losses we may incur but against which we cannot be insured or which we believe are not 

economically reasonable to insure such as losses due to acts of war employee and certain other crime and some natural disasters if we incur these losses and they are material our business could suffer certain material events may result in sizable losses for the insurance industry and adversely impact the availability of adequate insurance coverage or result in excessive premium increases to offset negative insurance market trends we may elect to selfinsure accept higher deductibles or reduce the amount of coverage in response to these market changes in addition we selfinsure a significant portion of expected losses under our workers compensation automobile liability general liability and group health insurance programs unanticipated changes in any applicable actuarial assumptions and management estimates underlying our recorded liabilities for these losses including expected increases in medical and indemnity costs could result in materially different expenses than expected under these programs which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition we are evaluating the potential future impact of recently enacted comprehensive healthcare reform legislation which may cause our healthcare costs to increase although we continue to maintain property insurance for catastrophic events at our store support center and distribution centers we are effectively selfinsured for other property losses if we experience a greater number of these losses than we anticipate our financial performance could be adversely affected 

  if we fail to protect our brand name competitors may adopt tradenames that dilute the value of our brand name 

we may be unable or unwilling to strictly enforce our trademarks in each jurisdiction in which we do business also we may not always be able to successfully enforce our trademarks against competitors or against challenges by others our failure to successfully protect our trademarks could diminish the value and efficacy of our brand recognition and could cause customer confusion which could in turn adversely affect our sales and profitability 

  our success depends on our executive officers and other key personnel if we lose key personnel or are unable to hire additional qualified personnel our business may be harmed 

our future success depends to a significant degree on the skills experience and efforts of our executive officers and other key personnel the loss of the services of any of our executive officers particularly richard w dreiling our chief executive officer could have a material adverse effect on our operations our future success will also depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and a failure to attract and retain new qualified personnel could have an adverse effect on our operations we do not currently maintain key person life insurance policies with respect to our executive officers or key personnel 

  we face risks related to protection of customers credit and debit card data and private data relating to us or our customers or employees 

in connection with credit card sales we transmit confidential credit and debit card information we also have access to collect or maintain private or confidential information regarding our customers and employees as well as our business we have procedures and technology in place to safeguard our customers debit and credit card information our employees private data and our confidential business information however third parties may have the technology or knowhow to breach the security of this information and our security measures and those of our technology vendors may not effectively prohibit others from obtaining improper access to this information a security breach of any kind could expose us to risks of data loss litigation government enforcement actions and costly response measures and could seriously disrupt our operations any resulting negative publicity could significantly harm our reputation which could cause us to lose market share and have an adverse effect on our financial results 

  while we have reduced our debt levels since 2007 we continue to have substantial debt that will need to be repaid or refinanced at or prior to applicable maturity dates which could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations and limit our ability to pursue our growth strategy or other opportunities or to react to changes in the economy or our industry 

at february 3 2012 we had total outstanding debt including the current portion of longterm obligations of 2618 billion including a 1964 billion senior secured term loan facility which matures on july 6 2014 4507 million aggregate principal amount of 11875  12625 senior subordinated toggle notes due 2017 and borrowings of 1847 million under our senior secured assetbased revolving credit facility we also had an additional 8079 million available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility which was scheduled to mature july 6 2013 but was amended on march 15 2012 to increase the maximum borrowing to 12 billion and extend the maturity date to july 6 2014 this level of debt and our ability to repay or refinance this debt prior to maturity could have important negative consequences to our business including 

• increasing our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions because our debt payment obligations may limit our ability to use our cash to respond to or defend against changes in the industry or the economy • requiring a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness therefore reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations capital expenditures and future business opportunities or pay dividends • limiting our ability to pursue our growth strategy • placing us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less highly leveraged and may be better able to use their cash flow to fund competitive responses to changing industry market or economic conditions • limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures debt service requirements acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes and • increasing the difficulty of our ability to make payments on our outstanding debt   our variable rate debt exposes us to interest rate risk which could adversely affect our cash flow 

the borrowings under the term loan facility and the senior secured assetbased revolving credit facility comprise our credit facilities and bear interest at variable rates other debt we incur also could be variable rate debt if market interest rates increase variable rate debt will create higher debt service requirements which could adversely affect our cash flow while we have entered and may in the future enter into agreements limiting our exposure to higher interest rates any such agreements may not offer complete protection from this risk 

  our debt agreements contain restrictions that could limit our flexibility in operating our business 

our credit facilities and the indentures governing our notes contain various covenants that could limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions these covenants limit our and our restricted subsidiaries ability to among other things 

• incur additional indebtedness issue disqualified stock or issue certain preferred stock • pay dividends and make certain distributions investments and other restricted payments • create certain liens or encumbrances • sell assets • enter into transactions with our affiliates 18 

• allow payments to us by our restricted subsidiaries • merge consolidate sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets and • designate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the agreement governing such indebtedness upon our failure to maintain compliance with these covenants the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit thereunder if the lenders under such indebtedness accelerate the repayment of borrowings we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay those borrowings as well as our other indebtedness including our outstanding notes we have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral under our credit facilities if we were unable to repay those amounts the lenders under our credit facilities could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness additional borrowings under the senior secured assetbased revolving credit facility will if excess availability under that facility is less than a certain amount be subject to the satisfaction of a specified financial ratio accordingly our ability to access the full availability under our senior secured assetbased revolving credit facility may be constrained our ability to meet this financial ratio can be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot assure you that we will meet this ratio if applicable and other covenants 

  new accounting guidance or changes in the interpretation or application of existing accounting guidance could adversely affect our financial performance 

the implementation of proposed new accounting standards may require extensive systems internal process and other changes that could increase our operating costs and may also result in changes to our financial statements in particular the implementation of expected future accounting standards related to leases as currently being contemplated by the convergence project between the financial accounting standards board fasb and the international accounting standards board iasb as well as the possible adoption of international financial reporting standards by us registrants could require us to make significant changes to our lease management fixed asset and other accounting systems and in all likelihood would result in changes to our financial statements 

us generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by our management changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments by our management could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance the outcome of such changes could include litigation or regulatory actions which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

  kohlberg kravis roberts  co lp kkr certain affiliates of goldman sachs  co the gs investors and other equity coinvestors collectively the investors have significant influence over us including in connection with decisions that require the approval of shareholders which could limit your ability to influence the outcome of key transactions including a change of control 

through their investment in buck holdings lp the investors hold a significant interest in our outstanding common stock as a result the investors potentially have the ability to influence the outcome of matters that require a vote of our shareholders including election of our board of directors and other corporate transactions regardless of whether others believe that the transaction is in our best interests in addition pursuant to a shareholders agreement that we entered into with buck holdings lp kkr and the gs investors kkr has a consent right over certain significant corporate actions and kkr and the gs investors have certain rights to appoint directors to our board and its committees for so long as buck holdings lp continues to hold a specified amount of our common stock 

the investors are also in the business of making investments in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us the investors may also pursue acquisition opportunities that are complementary to our business and as a result those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us so long as the investors or other funds controlled by or associated with the investors continue to indirectly own a significant amount of our outstanding common stock the investors will continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control our decisions the concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying preventing or deterring a change of control of our company could deprive shareholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our company and might ultimately affect the market price of our common stock 

  if we the investors or other significant shareholders sell a large number of shares of our common stock the market price of our common stock could decline 

the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of common stock in the market or the perception that such sales could occur these sales or the possibility that these sales may occur also might make it more difficult for us to issue equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate as of february 3 2012 we had approximately 3381 million shares of common stock outstanding of which approximately 46 were freely tradable on the new york stock exchange 

pursuant to shareholders agreements we have granted the investors the right to cause us in certain instances at our expense to file registration statements under the securities act of 1933 as amended covering resales of our common stock held by them or to piggyback on a registration statement in certain circumstances certain members of management hold similar piggyback registration rights as of february 3 2012 these shares collectively represented approximately 54 of our outstanding common stock to the extent that such registration rights are exercised the resulting sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock into the market could cause the market price of our common stock to decline these shares also may be sold pursuant to rule 144 under the securities act depending on their holding period and subject to restrictions in the case of shares held by persons deemed to be our affiliates

executive overview 

we are the largest discount retailer in the united states by number of stores with 9961 stores located in 39 states as of march 2 2012 primarily in the southern southwestern midwestern and eastern united states we offer a broad selection of merchandise including consumable products such as food paper and cleaning products health and beauty products and pet supplies and nonconsumable products such as seasonal merchandise home decor and domestics and apparel our merchandise includes high quality national brands from leading manufacturers as well as comparable quality private brand selections with prices at substantial discounts to national brands we offer our customers these national brand and private brand products at everyday low prices typically 10 or less in our convenient smallbox small store locations 

a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock is held by buck holdings lp a delaware limited partnership controlled by investment funds affiliated with kohlberg kravis roberts  co lp collectively kkr the membership interests of buck holdings lp and buck holdings llc the general partner of buck lp are held by a private investor group including affiliates of each of kkr and goldman sachs  co and other equity investors collectively the investors 

the customers we serve are valueconscious and dollar general has always been intensely focused on helping our customers make the most of their spending dollars we believe our convenient store format and broad selection of high quality products at compelling values have driven our substantial growth and financial success over the years like other companies we have been operating in an environment with heightened economic challenges and uncertainties consumers are facing high rates of unemployment fluctuating food gasoline and energy costs rising medical costs and a continued weakness in housing and consumer credit markets and the timetable and strength of any economic recovery is uncertain nonetheless as a result of our longterm mission of serving the valueconscious customer coupled with a vigorous focus on improving our operating and financial performance our 2011 and 2010 financial results were strong and we remain optimistic with regard to executing our operating priorities in 2012 

at the beginning of 2008 we defined four operating priorities which we remain keenly focused on executing these priorities are 1 drive productive sales growth 2 increase our gross margins 3 leverage process improvements and information technology to reduce costs and 4 strengthen and expand dollar generals culture of serving others 

our first priority is driving productive sales growth by increasing shopper frequency and transaction amount and maximizing sales per square foot in 2011 sales in samestores increased by 60 due to increases in traffic and average transaction and to a lesser extent the impact of inflation sales in samestores were aided by continued enhancements to our category management processes which help us determine the most productive merchandise offerings for our customers specific sales growth initiatives in 2011 included improvement in merchandise instock levels the completion of the final phase of raising the shelf height in our stores to 78 inches which impacted health and beauty aids further emphasis on the 100 price point the expansion of the number of coolers in approximately 500 existing stores and the impact of 575 remodeled and relocated stores during the year in addition to samestore sales growth we opened 625 new stores in 2011 our small box stores offer consumable items including packaged and refrigerated foods to communities that might not otherwise have convenient access at value prices to further expand this opportunity we opened 12 new dollar general market stores in 2011 

our second priority is to increase gross profit through effective category management the expansion of private brand offerings increased foreign sourcing shrink reduction distribution efficiencies and improvements to our pricing and markdown model while remaining committed to our everyday low price strategy we constantly review our pricing strategy and work diligently to minimize product cost increases as we focus on providing our customers quality merchandise at great values in our consumables category we strive to offer the optimal balance of the most popular nationally advertised brands and our own private brands which generally have higher gross profit rates than national brands throughout 2011 we experienced increased product costs primarily as the result of increases in the costs of certain commodities which were passed through to us these increased product costs negatively affected gross profit and resulted in an increased lifo provision in addition elevated costs of diesel fuel affected our overall merchandise costs in 2011 our shrink reduction efforts were successful in 2011 and we believe we have additional opportunities to reduce shrink in our stores 

our third priority is leveraging process improvements and information technology to reduce costs we are committed as an organization to extract costs that do not affect the customer experience in 2011 much of our focus was on decreasing our store labor costs while improving our store standards 

and overall customer experience we effectively implemented a new workforce management system resulting in significant cost savings as a percentage of sales we also further implemented an energy management system in the stores as part of our efforts to continue to increase productivity we installed faster data transmission technology in our stores and believe that going forward we will have additional opportunities to leverage this investment and our other information technology resources to create greater efficiencies in our retail store operations 

our fourth priority is to strengthen and expand dollar generals culture of serving others for customers this means helping them save time save money every day by providing clean wellstocked stores with quality products at low prices for employees this means creating an environment that attracts and retains key employees throughout the organization for the public this means giving back to our store communities through our charitable and other efforts in 2011 we donated approximately 24 million through our corporate charitable giving program for shareholders this means meeting their expectations of an efficiently and profitably run organization that operates with compassion and integrity 

our continued focus on these four priorities resulted in improved 2011 financial performance over the prior year as follows note that fiscal 2011 consisted of 53 weeks while fiscal 2010 consisted of 52 weeks basis points as referred to below are equal to 001 percent of total sales 

• total sales in 2011 53 weeks increased 136 over 2010 sales in samestores increased 60 with increases in both customer traffic and average transaction amount consumables most notably food drove 85 of the total increase in sales average sales per square foot in 2011 were 213 including a 4 contribution from the 53 rd week up from 201 in 2010 • operating profit increased 170 to 149 billion or 101 of sales compared to 127 billion or 98 of sales in 2010 the improvement in our operating profit rate was attributable to a 61 basispoint reduction of sga offset by a 31 basispoint contraction of our gross profit rate • the improvement in sga as a percentage of sales was due in large part to increased sales including the 53 rd week and improved utilization of store labor for other factors see the detailed discussion that follows • we are pleased with our ability to manage our gross profit rate in a period of significant commodity cost increases and related lifo charges high fuel costs and limited discretionary spending by our core customers our gross profit rate was also affected by numerous factors including a decrease in our mix of nonconsumables and higher markdowns • interest expense decreased by 69 million in 2011 to 205 million primarily as the result of lower average outstanding longterm obligations in 2011 we repurchased the remaining balance of our 10625 senior notes resulting in a nonoperating charge of 60 million total longterm obligations of 262 billion as of february 3 2012 were 670 million less than in the prior year • we reported net income of 767 million or 222 per diluted share for fiscal 2011 compared to net income of 628 million or 182 per diluted share for fiscal 2010 • we generated approximately 105 billion of cash flows from operating activities in 2011 an increase of over 27 percent compared to 2010 cash flow was primarily utilized to support our capital expenditures repurchase longterm obligations and repurchase our common stock • during 2011 we opened 625 new stores remodeled or relocated 575 stores and closed 60 stores included in these totals are 12 new and 25 remodeled dollar general market stores as discussed in more detail below in recent years we have generated significant cash flows from operating activities we have used a portion of these cash flows to pay down debt and to invest in new store growth through our traditional leased stores in the second half of 2010 we made a strategic 

decision to purchase certain of our leased stores and continued to purchase some stores in 2011 we believe that the current environment in the real estate markets provides an opportunity to make these investments at levels which are expected to result in favorable returns and positively impact our operating results 

in 2012 we plan to continue to focus on our four key operating priorities we will continue to refine and improve our store standards in order to increase sales focusing on achieving a consistent look and feel across the chain continued progress on improving our merchandise instock position is an important element in improving overall customer service and increasing sales as part of our category management program we plan to expand our refrigerated food offerings further expand our private brand consumables and increase the number of 100 price point items in our stores with regard to nonconsumables we plan to further improve the quality and appeal of our seasonal home and apparel merchandise and to continue to offer the items our customers want and need most frequently we will continue our focused shrink reduction efforts by employing our exception reporting tools and enhanced shrink optimization processes we will also continue to pursue global opportunities to directly source a larger portion of our products with the potential for significant savings to current costs 

with regard to leveraging information technology and process improvements to reduce costs we will continue to focus on making improvements that benefit our merchandising and operations efforts including further implementation of a new supply chainprocurement system which we anticipate will produce benefits in 2013 and beyond as well as enhanced pricing and markdown capabilities merchandise selection and allocation procedures we expect to gain further efficiencies with additional utilization of our workforce management systems and high speed data transmission capabilities 

finally we are pleased with the performance of our 2011 new stores remodels and relocations and in 2012 we plan to open 625 new stores and remodel or relocate an additional 550 stores included in our 2012 new store growth plans are 40 new dollar general market stores and we also intend to continue tests of a larger format traditional store with additional coolers and freezers in several markets 

in the first half of 2011 we utilized cash flow from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit agreement to repurchase the 864 million remaining balance of our outstanding 10625 senior notes reducing our interest expense and strengthening our financial position then in december 2011 we repurchased approximately 49 million shares of our outstanding common stock for 185 million in 2012 we plan to refinance the remaining 451 million of our 1187512625 outstanding senior subordinated notes further reducing interest expense in addition we plan to repurchase additional shares of our common stock under our current authorization with a remaining balance of 315 million 

key financial metrics we have identified the following as our most critical financial metrics for 2011 

• samestore sales growth • sales per square foot • gross profit as a percentage of sales • selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales • operating profit • inventory turnover • cash flow • net income 31 

• earnings per share • earnings before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization and • return on invested capital readers should refer to the detailed discussion of our operating results below for additional comments on financial performance in the current year periods as compared with the prior year periods 

results of operations 

accounting periods the following text contains references to years 2011 2010 and 2009 which represent fiscal years ended february 3 2012 january 28 2011 and january 29 2010 respectively our fiscal year ends on the friday closest to january 31 fiscal year 2011 was a 53week accounting period and fiscal years 2010 and 2009 were 52week accounting periods 

seasonality the nature of our business is seasonal to a certain extent primarily because of sales of holidayrelated merchandise sales in our fourth quarter november december and january have historically been higher than sales achieved in each of the first three quarters of the fiscal year expenses and to a greater extent operating profit vary by quarter results of a period shorter than a full year may not be indicative of results expected for the entire year furthermore the seasonal nature of our business may affect comparisons between periods 

the following table contains results of operations data for fiscal years 2011 2010 and 2009 and the dollar and percentage variances among those years 



net sales the net sales increase in 2011 reflects a samestore sales increase of 60 compared to 2010 samestores include stores that have been open for at least 13 months and remain open at the end of the reporting period for 2011 there were 9254 samestores which accounted for sales of 1363 billion samestore sales increases are calculated based on the comparable calendar weeks in the prior year accordingly the same store sales percentage for 2011 discussed above excludes sales from the 53 rd week as there was no comparable week in 2010 net sales for the 53 rd week of 2011 totaled 2893 million the remainder of the increase in sales in 2011 was attributable to new stores partially offset by sales from closed stores the increase in sales reflects increased customer traffic and average transaction amounts which is the result of the continued refinement of our merchandise offerings the 

optimization of our category management processes further improvement in store standards and an increase in sales prices resulting primarily from passing through certain cost increases and increased utilization of square footage in our stores increases in sales of consumables outpaced our nonconsumables with sales of packaged foods snacks beverages and perishables contributing the majority of the increase throughout the year 

the net sales increase in 2010 reflects a samestore sales increase of 49 compared to 2009 for 2010 there were 8712 samestores which accounted for sales of 1223 billion the remainder of the increase in sales in 2010 was attributable to new stores partially offset by sales from closed stores the increase in sales reflects the refinement of our merchandise offerings improvements in our category management processes and store standards and increased utilization of square footage in our stores 

of our four major merchandise categories the consumables category which generally has a lower gross profit rate than the other three categories has grown most significantly over the past several years because of the impact of sales mix on gross profit we continually review our merchandise mix and strive to adjust it when appropriate maintaining an appropriate sales mix is an integral part of achieving our gross profit and sales goals both the number of customer transactions and average transaction amount increased in 2011 and 2010 and we believe that our stores have benefited to some degree from attracting new customers who are seeking value as a result of the challenging macroeconomic environment in recent years 

gross profit the gross profit rate as a percentage of sales was 317 in 2011 compared to 320 in 2010 a decline of 31 basis points consumables which generally have lower markups than nonconsumables represented a greater percentage of sales in 2011 than in 2010 our purchase costs increased primarily due to increased commodity costs in addition we incurred higher markdowns and our transportation costs were impacted by higher fuel rates in 2011 our lifo provision increased to 477 million in 2011 compared to 53 million in 2010 in 2011 our mix of home and apparel merchandise decreased as percentage of sales and the gross profit rate within these categories decreased due in part to higher markdowns although we saw improvement in the home category in the latter part of 2011 we believe the economic environment continues to impede our ability to grow sales in discretionary areas such as this factors positively affecting gross profit include the selective price increases noted above as well as lower inventory shrinkage and distribution center costs as a percentage of sales 

the gross profit rate as a percentage of sales was 320 in 2010 compared to 313 in 2009 factors contributing to the increase in the 2010 gross profit rate include increased markups resulting primarily from higher purchase markups partially offset by increased markdowns as well as our category management efforts and increased sales volumes which have contributed to our ability to reduce purchase costs from our vendors our merchandising team continues to work closely with our vendors to provide quality merchandise at value prices to meet our customers demands in 2010 we recorded a lifo provision of 53 million reflecting an increase in certain merchandise costs the most significant of which occurred in the 2010 fourth quarter compared to a lifo benefit of 25 million in 2009 

sga expense sga expense was 217 as a percentage of sales in 2011 compared to 223 in 2010 an improvement of 61 basis points reflecting the favorable impact of the 136 increase in sales in addition retail labor expense increased at a rate lower than our increase in sales partially due to the rollout of our workforce management system a decrease in incentive compensation driven by more aggressive bonus targets and various cost reduction efforts affecting rent benefits electricity and other power costs among other expenses also contributed to the overall decrease in sga as a percentage of sales costs that increased at a rate higher than our increase in sales included those associated with our high speed store data network discussed above depreciation and amortization expense and fees associated with the increased use of debit cards depreciation and amortization 

increases were primarily due to investments in the store data network and store properties purchased sga in 2011 includes expenses totaling 131 million for payments and accruals related to the settlement and expected settlement of two legal matters sga in 2011 and 2010 includes expenses totaling 111 million and 197 million respectively for expenses primarily sharebased compensation incurred in connection with secondary offerings of our common stock 

sga expense was 223 as a percentage of sales in 2010 compared to 232 in 2009 an improvement of 93 basis points decreases in incentive compensation the cost of health benefits consulting fees and severance costs contributed to the overall decrease in sga as a percentage of sales as did other cost reduction and productivity initiatives other costs increasing at a rate lower than our 105 increase in sales include utilities which reflect lower waste management costs resulting from our recycling efforts as well as repairs and maintenance our increased sales levels in 2010 also favorably impacted sga as a percentage of sales debit card fees increased at a higher rate than the increase in sales primarily as a result of increased usage as a percentage of total transactions as noted above sga in 2010 included expenses primarily sharebased compensation totaling 197 million relating to two secondary offerings of our common stock sga in 2009 included expenses totaling 683 million or 58 basis points including 588 million relating to the termination of an advisory agreement among us kkr and goldman sachs  co and 94 million resulting from the acceleration of certain equity based compensation related to the completion of our initial public offering 

interest expense the decrease in interest expense in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily the result of lower average outstanding longterm obligations and lower average interest rates due to the redemption of our senior notes with cash and borrowings under our revolving credit facility in the first half of 2011 and lower allin interest rates on our term loan primarily due to reduced notional amounts on our interest rate swaps 

the decrease in interest expense in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily the result of lower average outstanding longterm obligations and lower allin interest rates on our term loan also primarily due to reduced notional amounts on our interest rate swaps 

we had outstanding variablerate debt of 163 billion and 093 billion as of february 3 2012 and january 28 2011 respectively after taking into consideration the impact of interest rate swaps the remainder of our outstanding indebtedness at february 3 2012 and january 28 2011 was fixed rate debt 

see the detailed discussion under liquidity and capital resources regarding indebtedness incurred to finance our 2007 merger along with subsequent repurchases of various longterm obligations and the related effect on interest expense in the periods presented 

other income expense in 2011 we recorded pretax losses of 603 million resulting from repurchases of 8643 million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes plus accrued and unpaid interest 

in 2010 we recorded pretax losses of 147 million resulting from the repurchase in the open market of 1150 million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes plus accrued and unpaid interest 

in 2009 we recorded charges totaling 555 million which primarily represents losses on debt retirement totaling 553 million and which also includes expenses of 06 million related to hedge ineffectiveness on certain of our interest rate swaps 

income taxes the effective income tax rates for 2011 2010 and 2009 were expenses of 374 363 and 385 respectively 

the 2011 effective tax rate of 374 was greater than the statutory tax rate of 35 due primarily to the inclusion of state income taxes in the total effective tax rate the 2011 effective rate was greater than the 2010 rate of 363 primarily due to the effective resolution of various examinations by the taxing authorities in 2010 that did not reoccur to the same extent in 2011 these factors resulted in rate increases in 2011 as compared to 2010 associated with state income taxes and income tax related interest expense increases in federal jobs related tax credits primarily due to the hire acts retention credit reduced the effective rate in 2011 as compared to 2010 the retention credit was only effective for 2011 other provisions authorizing various federal jobs credits primarily the work opportunity tax credit or wotc that we receive have generally expired for employees hired after december 31 2011 barring reenactment of these credits by congress the benefit realized by the company associated with jobs credits in 2012 will be significantly lower than the benefit realized in 2011 thereby increasing the 2012 effective rate we anticipate that the combined lapse of the retention credit and the expiration of the other jobs credits wotc will increase our 2012 effective rate by approximately 10 as compared to the 2011 rate 

the 2010 effective tax rate of 363 was greater than the statutory tax rate of 35 also due primarily to the inclusion of state income taxes in the total effective tax rate the 2010 effective rate was less than the 2009 rate due principally to reductions in state income tax expense income tax related interest expense and other expense items the 2010 effective resolution of various examinations by the taxing authorities when combined with unfavorable examination results in 2009 resulted in a decrease in the yeartoyear state income tax expense rate this decrease in state income tax expense was partially offset by an increase in state income tax expense due to a shift in income to companies within the group that have a higher effective state income tax rate in addition decreases also occurred due to favorable outcomes in 2010 associated with reductions in income tax related interest accruals and income tax related penalty accruals due to favorable income tax examination results the completion of a federal income tax examination and reductions in expense associated with uncertain tax benefit accruals 

the 2009 effective tax rate of 385 was greater than the statutory tax rate of 35 due primarily to the inclusion of state income taxes in the total effective tax rate 

off balance sheet arrangements 

the entities involved in ownership structure underlying the leases for three of our distribution centers meet the accounting definition of a variable interest entity vie one of these distribution centers has been recorded as a financing obligation whereby its property and equipment are reflected in our consolidated balance sheets the land and buildings of the other two distribution centers have been recorded as operating leases we are not the primary beneficiary of these vies and accordingly have not included these entities in our consolidated financial statements other than the foregoing we are not party to any off balance sheet arrangements 

effects of inflation 

in 2011 we experienced increased commodity cost pressures mainly related to food housewares and apparel products which were driven by increases in cotton sugar coffee groundnut resin petroleum and other raw material commodity costs we believe that our ability to selectively increase selling prices in response to cost increases partially mitigated the effect of these cost increases on our overall results of operations we experienced little or no overall product cost inflation in 2010 and 2009 

liquidity and capital resources 

current financial condition 

during the past three years we have generated an aggregate of approximately 255 billion in cash flows from operating activities during that period we expanded the number of stores we operate by 1575 or approximately 19 remodeled or relocated 1529 stores or approximately 15 of stores we operated as of february 3 2012 and incurred approximately 119 billion in capital expenditures we made certain strategic decisions which slowed our store growth for a period prior to 2009 but we reaccelerated store growth beginning in 2009 and currently plan to continue that strategy in 2012 and for the foreseeable future 

at february 3 2012 we had total outstanding debt including the current portion of longterm obligations of 262 billion which includes our senior secured assetbased revolving credit facility abl facility and together with the term loan facility the credit facilities and senior subordinated notes all of which are described in greater detail below we had 8079 million available for borrowing under the abl facility at february 3 2012 our liquidity needs are significant primarily due to our debt service and other obligations our substantial debt could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry or to pursue our growth strategy expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt and increase the difficulty of our ability to make payments on our outstanding debt securities 

we believe our cash flow from operations and existing cash balances combined with availability under the credit facilities described in greater detail below will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our current obligations projected working capital requirements and capital spending for a period that includes the next twelve months as well as the next several years 

the abl facility was amended and restated on march 15 2012 as discussed below under recent developments 

credit facilities 

overview the credit facilities consist of the 1964 billion term loan facility and the abl facility which was recently amended to a maximum of 12 billion of which up to 3500 million is available for letters of credit subject to borrowing base availability the abl facility includes borrowing capacity available for letters of credit and for shortterm borrowings referred to as swingline loans 

interest rates and fees borrowings under the credit facilities bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus at our option either a libor or b a base rate which is usually equal to the prime rate the applicable margin for borrowings under the term loan facility is 275 for libor borrowings and 175 for baserate borrowings the interest rate for borrowings under the term loan facility was 31 without giving effect to the market rate swaps discussed below as of february 3 2012 

the current interest rate for the amended abl facility is described below under recent developments as of february 3 2012 the applicable margin for borrowings under the abl facility except for the last out tranche was 150 for libor borrowings and 050 for baserate borrowings the applicable margin for the last out borrowings was 225 for libor borrowings and 125 for baserate borrowings and the commitment fee to the lenders for any unutilized commitments was 0375 per annum see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk below for a discussion of our use of interest rate swaps to manage our interest rate risk 

prepayments the senior secured credit agreement for the term loan facility requires us to prepay outstanding term loans subject to certain exceptions with 

• 50 of our annual excess cash flow as defined in the credit agreement which will be reduced to 25 and 0 if we achieve and maintain a total net leverage ratio of 60 to 10 and 50 to 10 respectively • 100 of the net cash proceeds of all nonordinary course asset sales or other dispositions of property in excess of 250 million in the aggregate and subject to our right to reinvest the proceeds and • 100 of the net cash proceeds of any incurrence of debt other than proceeds from debt permitted under the senior secured credit agreement the mandatory prepayments discussed above will be applied to the term loan facility as directed by the senior secured credit agreement no prepayments have been required under the prepayment provisions listed above the term loan facility can be prepaid in whole or in part at any time 

in addition the senior secured credit agreement for the abl facility requires us to prepay the abl facility subject to certain exceptions as follows 

• with 100 of the net cash proceeds of all nonordinary course asset sales or other dispositions of revolving facility collateral as defined below in excess of 10 million in the aggregate and subject to our right to reinvest the proceeds and • to the extent such extensions of credit exceed the then current borrowing base as defined in the senior secured credit agreement for the abl facility the mandatory prepayments discussed above will be applied to the abl facility as directed by the senior secured credit agreement for the abl facility no prepayments have been required under the prepayment provisions listed above 

an event of default under the senior secured credit agreements will occur upon a change of control as defined in the senior secured credit agreements governing our credit facilities upon an event of default indebtedness under the credit facilities may be accelerated in which case we will be required to repay all outstanding loans plus accrued and unpaid interest and all other amounts outstanding under the credit facilities 

amortization the original terms of the term loan facility required quarterly payments of principal beginning september 30 2009 as a result of voluntary prepayments under the term loan facility no further quarterly principal installments will be required prior to maturity of the term loan on july 6 2014 there is no amortization under the abl facility 

guarantee and security all obligations under the credit facilities are unconditionally guaranteed by substantially all of our existing and future domestic subsidiaries excluding certain immaterial subsidiaries and certain subsidiaries designated by us under our senior secured credit agreements as unrestricted subsidiaries referred to collectively as us guarantors 

all obligations and related guarantees under the term loan facility are secured by 

• a secondpriority security interest in all existing and afteracquired inventory accounts receivable and other assets arising from such inventory and accounts receivable of our company and each us guarantor the revolving facility collateral subject to certain exceptions • a firstpriority security interest in and mortgages on substantially all of our and each us guarantors tangible and intangible assets other than the revolving facility collateral and • a firstpriority pledge of 100 of the capital stock held by us or any of our domestic subsidiaries that are directly owned by us or one of the us guarantors and 65 of the voting capital stock of each of our existing and future foreign subsidiaries that are directly owned by us or one of the us guarantors 38 

certain covenants and events of default the senior secured credit agreements contain a number of covenants that among other things restrict subject to certain exceptions our ability to 

• incur additional indebtedness • sell assets • pay dividends and distributions or repurchase our capital stock • make investments or acquisitions • repay or repurchase subordinated indebtedness including the senior subordinated notes discussed below • amend material agreements governing our subordinated indebtedness including the senior subordinated notes discussed below • change our lines of business the senior secured credit agreements also contain certain customary affirmative covenants and events of default 

at february 3 2012 we had the following amounts outstanding under our abl facility borrowings of 1847 million standby letters of credit of 217 million and commercial letters of credit of 167 million 

senior notes due 2015 and senior subordinated toggle notes due 2017 

overview on april 29 2011 we repurchased in the open market 250 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 10625 senior notes due 2015 the senior notes at a redemption price of 1070 of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest resulting in a pretax loss of 22 million on july 15 2011 we redeemed the remaining 8393 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of the senior notes which had been scheduled to mature on july 15 2015 at a redemption price of 105313 of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest resulting in a pretax loss of 581 million the redemption was effected in accordance with the indenture dated as of july 6 2007 governing the senior notes pursuant to a notice dated may 31 2011 the pretax losses on these transactions are reflected in other income expense in our consolidated statement of income for 2011 we funded the redemption price for the senior notes with cash on hand and borrowings under the abl facility the redemption is a significant factor in the reduction of our cash balances at february 3 2012 compared to the prior year end 

as of february 3 2012 we had 4507 million aggregate principal amount of 1187512625 senior subordinated toggle notes due 2017 the senior subordinated notes outstanding which mature on july 15 2017 pursuant to an indenture dated as of july 6 2007 the senior subordinated indenture 

interest on the senior subordinated notes is payable on january 15 and july 15 of each year cash interest on the senior subordinated notes accrues at a rate of 11875 per annum an option to pay interest by increasing the principal amount of the senior subordinated notes or issuing new senior subordinated notes pik interest instead of paying cash interest expired in 2011 as a result all interest on the senior subordinated notes has been paid or will be payable in cash 

the senior subordinated notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by each of the existing and future direct or indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries that guarantee the obligations under our credit facilities 

we intend to redeem some or all of the senior subordinated notes near the first scheduled call date in july 2012 we may redeem some or all of the senior subordinated notes at any time at 

redemption prices described or set forth in the senior subordinated indenture we also may seek from time to time to retire some or all of the senior subordinated notes through cash purchases on the open market in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise such repurchases if any will depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors the amounts involved may be material 

change of control upon the occurrence of a change of control which is defined in the senior subordinated indenture each holder of the senior subordinated notes has the right to require us to repurchase some or all of such holders senior subordinated notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101 of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest if any to the repurchase date 

covenants the senior subordinated indenture contains covenants limiting among other things our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to subject to certain exceptions 

• incur additional debt issue disqualified stock or issue certain preferred stock • pay dividends and or make certain distributions investments and other restricted payments • create certain liens or encumbrances • sell assets • enter into transactions with our affiliates • allow payments to us by our restricted subsidiaries • consolidate merge sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets and • designate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries events of default the senior subordinated indenture also provides for events of default which if any of them occurs would permit or require the principal of and accrued interest on the senior subordinated notes to become or to be declared due and payable 

adjusted ebitda 

under the agreements governing the credit facilities and the senior subordinated indenture certain limitations and restrictions could arise if we are not able to satisfy and remain in compliance with specified financial ratios management believes the most significant of such ratios is the senior secured incurrence test under the credit facilities this test measures the ratio of the senior secured debt to adjusted ebitda this ratio would need to be no greater than 425 to 1 to avoid such limitations and restrictions as of february 3 2012 this ratio was 11 to 1 senior secured debt is defined as our total debt secured by liens or similar encumbrances less cash and cash equivalents ebitda is defined as income loss from continuing operations before cumulative effect of change in accounting principles plus interest and other financing costs net provision for income taxes and depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda is defined as ebitda further adjusted to give effect to adjustments required in calculating this covenant ratio under our credit facilities ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not presentations made in accordance with us gaap are not measures of financial performance or condition liquidity or profitability and should not be considered as an alternative to 1 net income operating income or any other performance measures determined in accordance with us gaap or 2 operating cash flows determined in accordance with us gaap additionally ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not intended to be measures of free cash flow for managements discretionary use as they do not consider certain cash requirements such as interest payments tax payments and debt service requirements and replacements of fixed assets 

our presentation of ebitda and adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under 

us gaap because not all companies use identical calculations these presentations of ebitda and adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies we believe that the presentation of ebitda and adjusted ebitda is appropriate to provide additional information about the calculation of this financial ratio in the credit facilities adjusted ebitda is a material component of this ratio specifically noncompliance with the senior secured indebtedness ratio contained in our credit facilities could prohibit us from making investments incurring liens making certain restricted payments and incurring additional secured indebtedness other than the additional funding provided for under the senior secured credit agreement and pursuant to specified exceptions 

the calculation of adjusted ebitda under the credit facilities is as follows 



interest rate swaps 

we use interest rate swaps to minimize the risk of adverse changes in interest rates these swaps are intended to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure because of high correlation between the derivative financial instrument and the underlying exposure being hedged fluctuations in the value of the financial instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying economic exposure our principal interest rate exposure relates to outstanding amounts under our credit facilities at february 3 2012 we had interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of approximately 5333 million for more information see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk below 

fair value accounting 

we have classified our interest rate swaps as further discussed in item 7a below in level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as the significant inputs to the overall valuations are based on marketobservable data or information derived from or corroborated by marketobservable data including marketbased inputs to models model calibration to marketclearing transactions broker or dealer quotations or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency where models 

are used the selection of a particular model to value a derivative depends upon the contractual terms of and specific risks inherent in the instrument as well as the availability of pricing information in the market we use similar models to value similar instruments valuation models require a variety of inputs including contractual terms market prices yield curves credit curves measures of volatility and correlations of such inputs for our derivatives all of which trade in liquid markets model inputs can generally be verified and model selection does not involve significant management judgment 

we incorporate credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the respective counterpartys nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements of our derivatives the credit valuation adjustments are calculated by determining the total expected exposure of the derivatives which incorporates both the current and potential future exposure and then applying each counterpartys credit spread to the applicable exposure for derivatives with twoway exposure such as interest rate swaps the counterpartys credit spread is applied to our exposure to the counterparty and our own credit spread is applied to the counterpartys exposure to us and the net credit valuation adjustment is reflected in our derivative valuations the total expected exposure of a derivative is derived using marketobservable inputs such as yield curves and volatilities the inputs utilized for our own credit spread are based on implied spreads from our publiclytraded debt for counterparties with publicly available credit information the credit spreads over libor used in the calculations represent implied credit default swap spreads obtained from a third party credit data provider in adjusting the fair value of our derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk we have considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements such as collateral postings thresholds mutual puts and guarantees additionally we actively monitor counterparty credit ratings for any significant changes 

as of february 3 2012 the net credit valuation adjustments reduced the settlement values of our derivative liabilities by 01 million various factors impact changes in the credit valuation adjustments over time including changes in the credit spreads of the parties to the contracts as well as changes in market rates and volatilities which affect the total expected exposure of the derivative instruments when appropriate valuations are also adjusted for various factors such as liquidity and bidoffer spreads which factors we deemed to be immaterial as of february 3 2012 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of february 3 2012 in thousands 





a represents obligations for interest payments on longterm debt and capital lease obligations and includes projected interest on variable rate longterm debt using 2011 year end rates variable rate longterm debt includes the balance of the senior secured assetbased revolving credit facility of 1847 million the balance of our tax increment financing of 145 million and 1430 billion of the senior secured term loan facility net of the effect of interest rate swaps b we retain a significant portion of the risk for our workers compensation employee health insurance general liability property loss and automobile insurance as these obligations do not have scheduled maturities these amounts represent undiscounted estimates based upon actuarial assumptions reserves for workers compensation and general liability which existed as of the date of our 2007 merger were discounted in order to arrive at estimated fair value all other amounts are reflected on an undiscounted basis in our consolidated balance sheets c operating lease obligations are inclusive of amounts included in deferred rent and closed store obligations in our consolidated balance sheets d commercial commitments include information technology license and support agreements supplies fixtures letters of credit for import merchandise and other inventory purchase obligations e purchase obligations include legally binding agreements for software licenses and support supplies fixtures and merchandise purchases excluding such purchases subject to letters of credit f we have potential payment obligations associated with uncertain tax positions that are not reflected in these totals we anticipate that approximately 03 million of such amounts will be paid in the coming year we are currently unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the taxing authorities for our remaining 411 million of reserves for uncertain tax positions 

recent developments 

on march 15 2012 the abl facility was amended and restated the maturity date was extended from july 6 2013 to july 6 2014 and the total commitment was increased from 1031 billion to 12 billion of which up to 3500 million is available for letters of credit subject to borrowing base availability the abl facility includes borrowing capacity available for letters of credit and for shortterm borrowings referred to as swingline loans the amount available under the abl facility including letters of credit shall not exceed the borrowing base which equals the sum of i 90 of the net orderly liquidation value of all our eligible inventory and that of each guarantor thereunder and ii 90 of all our accounts receivable and creditdebit card receivables and that of each guarantor thereunder in each case subject to customary reserves and eligibility criteria 

the initial applicable margin for all borrowings under the abl facility is 175 for libor borrowings and 075 for baserate borrowings we are also required to pay a commitment fee to the lenders under the abl facility for any unutilized commitments initially at a rate of 0375 per annum the applicable margins for borrowings and the commitment fees under the abl facility are subject to adjustment each quarter based on average daily excess availability under the abl facility we also must pay customary letter of credit fees 

the entire principal amounts if any outstanding under the abl facility are due and payable in full at maturity on july 6 2014 on which day the commitments thereunder will terminate all obligations and related guarantees under the abl facility are secured by the revolving facility collateral subject to certain exceptions 

in addition we recently commenced efforts to amend our term loan facility to extend the maturity of a portion of the term loan facility from 2014 to 2017 there can be no assurance that we will be able to amend the term loan facility on these terms or at all 

share repurchase program 

on november 30 2011 our board of directors approved a share repurchase program of up to 500 million of outstanding shares of our common stock under the authorization purchases may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time subject to market conditions this repurchase authorization has no expiration date as part of this repurchase program pursuant to a share repurchase agreement between dollar general and buck holdings lp dated december 4 2011 concurrent with the closing of a secondary offering in december 2011 dollar general purchased 4915637 shares of common stock from buck holdings lp for an aggregate purchase price of 185 million 

other considerations 

we have no current plans to pay any cash dividends on our common stock and instead may retain earnings if any for future operation and expansion common stock repurchases and debt repayment any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our board of directors subject to certain limitations found in covenants in our credit facilities and in the indenture governing the senior subordinated notes as discussed in more detail above and will depend on among other things our results of operations cash requirements financial condition contractual restrictions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant 

our inventory balance represented approximately 49 of our total assets exclusive of goodwill and other intangible assets as of february 3 2012 our proficiency in managing our inventory balances can have a significant impact on our cash flows from operations during a given fiscal year as a result efficient inventory management has been and continues to be an area of focus for us 

as described in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements we are involved in a number of legal actions and claims some of which could potentially result in material cash payments adverse developments in those actions could materially and adversely affect our liquidity as discussed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements we also have certain income taxrelated contingencies future negative developments could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity 

in july 2011 standard  poors upgraded our corporate rating to bb with a stable outlook and moodys raised our corporate rating to ba2 with a stable outlook our current credit ratings as well as future rating agency actions could i impact our ability to obtain financings to finance our operations on satisfactory terms ii affect our financing costs and iii affect our insurance premiums and collateral requirements necessary for our selfinsured programs there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or improve our current credit ratings 

cash flows 

cash flows from operating activities a significant component of our increase in cash flows from operating activities in 2011 compared to 2010 was the increase in net income due to increases in sales and gross profit and lower sga expenses as a percentage of sales as described in more detail above under results of operations significant components of the increase in cash flows from operating activities in 2011 compared to 2010 were related to working capital in general and accrued expenses and other in particular items affecting accrued expenses and other include increased accruals for income tax reserves increased accruals for legal settlements and taxes exclusive of taxes on income partially offset by reduced interest accruals the timing of interest and certain other accruals and the related payments were affected by the 53 rd week in 2011 partially offsetting this increase in cash flows were an increase in income taxes paid in 2011 compared to 2010 due to increased net income and changes in inventory balances which increased by 14 in 2011 compared to an increase of 16 in 2010 although we continue to closely monitor our inventory balances they often fluctuate from period to period and from year to year based on new store openings the timing of purchases merchandising initiatives and other factors inventory levels in the consumables category increased by 1323 million or 13 in 2011 compared to an increase of 1339 million or 16 in 2010 the seasonal category increased by 275 million or 7 in 2011 compared to an increase of 552 million or 18 in 2010 the home products category increased 246 million or 14 in 2011 compared to an increase of 252 million or 17 in 2010 the apparel category increased by 594 million or 24 in 2011 compared to an increase of 323 million or 15 in 2010 

a significant component of our increase in cash flows from operating activities in 2010 compared to 2009 was the increase in net income due to increases in sales and gross profit and lower sga expenses as a percentage of sales as described in more detail above under results of operations partially offsetting this increase in cash flows were changes in inventory balances which increased by 16 in 2010 compared to an increase of 7 in 2009 inventory levels in the consumables category increased by 1339 million or 16 in 2010 compared to an increase of 1114 million or 15 in 2009 the seasonal category increased by 552 million or 18 in 2010 compared to an increase of 253 million or 9 in 2009 the home products category increased 252 million or 17 in 2010 compared to a decline of 91 million or 6 in 2009 the apparel category increased by 323 million or 15 in 2010 compared to a decline of 229 million or 10 in 2009 in addition increased net income resulted in an increase in income taxes paid in 2010 compared to 2009 changes in accrued expenses and other were affected in part by reductions of income tax reserves and reduced accruals for incentive compensation partially offset by the timing of payments related to a litigation settlement in prior years and by lower accruals for interest on longterm debt 

cash flows from investing activities significant components of property and equipment purchases in 2011 included the following approximate amounts 120 million for distribution centers including our newly built center in alabama 114 million for new leased stores 80 million for improvements and upgrades to existing stores 80 million for stores purchased or built by us 73 million for remodels and relocations of existing stores 28 million for systemsrelated capital projects and 15 million for transportationrelated capital the timing of new remodeled and relocated store openings along with other factors may affect the relationship between such openings and the related property and equipment purchases in any given period during 2011 we opened 625 new stores and remodeled or relocated 575 stores 

significant components of our property and equipment purchases in 2010 included the following approximate amounts 156 million for improvements upgrades remodels and relocations of existing stores 100 million for new leased stores 91 million for stores purchased or built by us 45 million for distribution and transportationrelated capital expenditures and 22 million for information systems upgrades and technologyrelated projects during 2010 we opened 600 new stores and remodeled or relocated 504 stores 

significant components of our property and equipment purchases in 2009 included the following approximate amounts 114 million for improvements upgrades remodels and relocations of existing stores 69 million for new leased stores 28 million for distribution and transportationrelated capital expenditures 24 million for various administrative capital costs and 11 million for information systems upgrades and technologyrelated projects during 2009 we opened 500 new stores and remodeled or relocated 450 stores 

capital expenditures during 2012 are projected to be in the range of 600650 million we anticipate funding 2012 capital requirements with cash flows from operations and if necessary we also have significant availability under our abl facility approximately 65 percent of projected capital spending is for investment in store growth and development for approximately 625 new stores and for approximately 550 stores to be remodeled or relocated capital expenditures are anticipated for the construction of new stores costs related to new leased stores such as leasehold improvements fixtures and equipment the purchase of existing stores and continued investment in our existing store base approximately 15 percent of projected capital spending is for transportation distribution and special projects and the remaining 20 percent is for routine and ongoing capital requirements 

included in our 2012 new store growth plans are 40 new dollar general market stores some of which we will introduce in new markets including california and nevada we also intend to test a larger format traditional store with additional coolers and freezers in several markets the market and larger format traditional stores require higher investments than our traditional stores which can vary depending on numbers of coolers square feet type of construction and layout because we are testing several different formats the costs of rolling out these concepts in larger quantities should we decide to do so are uncertain at the present time we plan to undertake these expenditures as part of our efforts to improve our infrastructure and increase our cash generated from operating activities 

cash flows from financing activities on july 15 2011 we redeemed 8393 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding senior notes at total cost of 8839 million including associated premiums and on april 29 2011 we repurchased in the open market 250 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes at a total cost of 268 million including associated premiums a portion of the july 2011 redemption of senior notes was financed by borrowings under the abl facility net borrowings under the abl facility were 1847 million during 2011 in december 2011 we repurchased 49 million outstanding shares from our principal shareholder at a total cost of 1850 million 

during 2010 we repurchased 1150 million outstanding principal amount of our outstanding senior notes at a total cost of 1275 million including associated premiums we had no borrowings or repayments under the abl facility in 2010 

in 2009 we had cash inflows from the issuance of equity of 4438 million primarily due to our initial public offering of 227 million shares of common stock we used the proceeds from the offering to redeem outstanding notes with a total principal amount of 4009 million at a premium and used cash generated from operations to repay 3365 million outstanding principal amount on our term loan facility we had no borrowings or repayments under the abl facility in 2009 in addition we paid a dividend and related amounts totaling 2397 million using cash generated from operations 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures in addition to the estimates presented below there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed critical as defined below we believe these estimates are reasonable and appropriate however if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used the resulting changes could have a material effect on the financial statements taken as a whole 

management believes the following policies and estimates are critical because they involve significant judgments assumptions and estimates management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosures presented below relating to those policies and estimates 

merchandise inventories merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined using the retail lastin firstout lifo method under our retail inventory method rim the calculation of gross profit and the resulting valuation of inventories at cost are computed by applying a calculated costtoretail inventory ratio to the retail value of sales at a department level the rim is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality also it is recognized that the use of the rim will result in valuing inventories at the lower of cost or market lcm if markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories 

inherent in the rim calculation are certain significant management judgments and estimates including among others initial markups markdowns and shrinkage which significantly impact the gross profit calculation as well as the ending inventory valuation at cost these significant estimates coupled with the fact that the rim is an averaging process can under certain circumstances produce distorted cost figures factors that can lead to distortion in the calculation of the inventory balance include 

• applying the rim to a group of products that is not fairly uniform in terms of its cost and selling price relationship and turnover • applying the rim to transactions over a period of time that include different rates of gross profit such as those relating to seasonal merchandise • inaccurate estimates of inventory shrinkage between the date of the last physical inventory at a store and the financial statement date and • inaccurate estimates of lcm andor lifo reserves factors that reduce potential distortion include the use of historical experience in estimating the shrink provision see discussion below and an annual lifo analysis whereby all skus are considered in the index formulation an actual valuation of inventory under the lifo method is made at the end of each year based on the inventory levels and costs at that time accordingly interim lifo calculations are based on managements estimates of expected yearend inventory levels sales for the year and the expected rate of inflationdeflation for the year and are thus subject to adjustment in the final yearend lifo inventory valuation we also perform interim inventory analysis for determining obsolete inventory our policy is to write down inventory to an lcm value based on various management assumptions including estimated markdowns and sales required to liquidate such inventory in future periods inventory is reviewed on a quarterly basis and adjusted to reflect writedowns as appropriate 

factors such as slower inventory turnover due to changes in competitors practices consumer preferences consumer spending and unseasonable weather patterns among other factors could cause excess inventory requiring greater than estimated markdowns to entice consumer purchases resulting in an unfavorable impact on our consolidated financial statements sales shortfalls due to the above factors could cause reduced purchases from vendors and associated vendor allowances that would also result in an unfavorable impact on our consolidated financial statements 

we calculate our shrink provision based on actual physical inventory results during the fiscal period and an accrual for estimated shrink occurring subsequent to a physical inventory through the end of the fiscal reporting period this accrual is calculated as a percentage of sales at each retail store at a department level and is determined by dividing the booktophysical inventory adjustments 

recorded during the previous twelve months by the related sales for the same period for each store to the extent that subsequent physical inventories yield different results than this estimated accrual our effective shrink rate for a given reporting period will include the impact of adjusting the estimated results to the actual results although we perform physical inventories in virtually all of our stores on an annual basis the same stores do not necessarily get counted in the same reporting periods from year to year which could impact comparability in a given reporting period 

we believe our estimates and assumptions related to merchandise inventories have generally been accurate in recent years and we do not currently anticipate material changes in these estimates and assumptions 

goodwill and other intangible assets we amortize intangible assets over their estimated useful lives unless such lives are deemed indefinite if impairment indicators are noted amortizable intangible assets are tested for impairment based on projected undiscounted cash flows and if impaired written down to fair value based on either discounted projected cash flows or appraised values future cash flow projections are based on managements projections significant judgments required in this testing process may include projecting future cash flows determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions projections are based on managements best estimates given recent financial performance market trends strategic plans and other available information which in recent years have been materially accurate although not currently anticipated changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value or impairment future indicators of impairment could result in an asset impairment charge 

under accounting standards for goodwill and other intangible assets we are required to test such assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators occur the goodwill impairment test is a twostep process that requires management to make judgments in determining what assumptions to use in the calculation the first step of the process consists of estimating the fair value of our reporting unit based on valuation techniques including a discounted cash flow model using revenue and profit forecasts and comparing that estimated fair value with the recorded carrying value which includes goodwill if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment if any by determining an implied fair value of goodwill the determination of the implied fair value of goodwill would require us to allocate the estimated fair value of our reporting unit to its assets and liabilities any unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill which would be compared to its corresponding carrying value 

the impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount if the carrying amount of an indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 

we completed testing on our goodwill and indefinite lived trade name intangible assets during the third quarter of 2011 no indicators of impairment were evident and no adjustment to these assets was required we are not currently projecting a decline in cash flows that could be expected to have an adverse effect such as a violation of debt covenants or future impairment charges 

property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost we group our assets into relatively homogeneous classes and generally provide for depreciation on a straightline basis over the estimated average useful life of each asset class except for leasehold improvements which are amortized over the lesser of the applicable lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset certain store and warehouse fixtures when fully depreciated are removed from the cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization accounts the valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of depreciable lives involves significant judgments and the use of estimates which we believe have been materially accurate in recent years 

impairment of longlived assets we review the carrying value of longlived assets for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with accounting standards for impairment or disposal of longlived assets we review for impairment stores open for approximately two years or more for which recent cash flows from operations are negative impairment results when the carrying value of the assets exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the life of the lease our estimate of undiscounted future cash flows over the lease term is based upon historical operations of the stores and estimates of future store profitability which encompasses many factors that are subject to variability and are difficult to predict if a longlived asset is found to be impaired the amount recognized for impairment is equal to the difference between the carrying value and the assets estimated fair value the fair value is estimated based primarily upon projected future cash flows discounted at our credit adjusted riskfree rate or other reasonable estimates of fair market value in accordance with us gaap during 2011 2010 and 2009 we recorded pretax impairment charges of 10 million 17 million and 50 million respectively for certain store assets that we deemed to be impaired 

insurance liabilities we retain a significant portion of the risk for our workers compensation employee health property loss automobile and general liability these represent significant costs primarily due to the large employee base and number of stores provisions are made to these liabilities on an undiscounted basis based on actual claim data and estimates of incurred but not reported claims developed using actuarial methodologies based on historical claim trends which have been and are anticipated to continue to be materially accurate if future claim trends deviate from recent historical patterns we may be required to record additional expenses or expense reductions which could be material to our future financial results 

contingent liabilities—income taxes income tax reserves are determined using the methodology established by accounting standards relating to uncertainty in income taxes these standards require companies to assess each income tax position taken using a two step process a determination is first made as to whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained based upon the technical merits upon examination by the taxing authorities if the tax position is expected to meet the more likely than not criteria the benefit recorded for the tax position equals the largest amount that is greater than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement of the respective tax position uncertain tax positions require determinations and estimated liabilities to be made based on provisions of the tax law which may be subject to change or varying interpretation if our determinations and estimates prove to be inaccurate the resulting adjustments could be material to our future financial results 

contingent liabilities—legal matters we are subject to legal regulatory and other proceedings and claims we establish liabilities as appropriate for these claims and proceedings based upon the probability and estimability of losses and to fairly present in conjunction with the disclosures of these matters in our financial statements and sec filings managements view of our exposure we review outstanding claims and proceedings with external counsel to assess probability and estimates of loss we reevaluate these assessments on a quarterly basis or as new and significant information becomes available to determine whether a liability should be established or if any existing liability should be adjusted the actual cost of resolving a claim or proceeding ultimately may be substantially different than the amount of the recorded liability in addition because it is not permissible under us gaap to establish a litigation liability until the loss is both probable and estimable in some cases there may be insufficient time to establish a liability prior to the actual incurrence of the loss upon verdict and judgment at trial for example or in the case of a quickly negotiated settlement 

lease accounting and excess facilities many of our stores are subject to buildtosuit arrangements with landlords which typically carry a primary lease term of 1015 years with multiple renewal options we also have stores subject to shorterterm leases and many of these leases have 

renewal options as of february 3 2012 approximately 26 of our stores had provisions for contingent rentals based upon a percentage of defined sales volume we recognize contingent rental expense when the achievement of specified sales targets is considered probable we recognize rent expense over the term of the lease we record minimum rental expense on a straightline basis over the base noncancelable lease term commencing on the date that we take physical possession of the property from the landlord which normally includes a period prior to store opening to make necessary leasehold improvements and install store fixtures when a lease contains a predetermined fixed escalation of the minimum rent we recognize the related rent expense on a straightline basis and record the difference between the recognized rental expense and the amounts payable under the lease as deferred rent tenant allowances to the extent received are recorded as deferred incentive rent and amortized as a reduction to rent expense over the term of the lease we reflect as a liability any difference between the calculated expense and the amounts actually paid improvements of leased properties are amortized over the shorter of the life of the applicable lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset 

for store closures excluding those associated with a business combination where a lease obligation still exists we record the estimated future liability associated with the rental obligation on the date the store is closed in accordance with accounting standards for costs associated with exit or disposal activities based on an overall analysis of store performance and expected trends management periodically evaluates the need to close underperforming stores liabilities are established at the point of closure for the present value of any remaining operating lease obligations net of estimated sublease income and at the communication date for severance and other exit costs key assumptions in calculating the liability include the timeframe expected to terminate lease agreements estimates related to the sublease potential of closed locations and estimation of other related exit costs historically these estimates have not been materially inaccurate however if actual timing and potential termination costs or realization of sublease income differ from our estimates the resulting liabilities could vary from recorded amounts these liabilities are reviewed periodically and adjusted when necessary 

sharebased payments our sharebased stock option awards are valued on an individual grant basis using the blackscholesmerton closed form option pricing model we believe that this model fairly estimates the value of our sharebased awards the application of this valuation model involves assumptions that are judgmental and highly sensitive in the valuation of stock options which affects compensation expense related to these options these assumptions include an estimate of the fair value of our common stock the term that the options are expected to be outstanding the historical volatility of our stock price applicable interest rates and the dividend yield of our stock other factors involving judgments that affect the expensing of sharebased payments include estimated forfeiture rates of sharebased awards historically these estimates have not been materially inaccurate however if our estimates differ materially from actual experience we may be required to record additional expense or reductions of expense which could be material to our future financial results 

fair value measurements we measure fair value of assets and liabilities in accordance with applicable accounting standards which require that fair values be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability these standards establish a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity observable inputs that are classified within levels 1 and 2 of the hierarchy and the reporting entitys own assumptions about market participant assumptions unobservable inputs classified within level 3 of the hierarchy therefore level 3 inputs are typically based on an entitys own assumptions as there is little if any related market activity and thus require the use of significant judgment and estimates currently we have no assets or liabilities that are valued based solely on level 3 inputs 

our fair value measurements are primarily associated with our derivative financial instruments intangible assets property and equipment and to a lesser degree our investments the values of our derivative financial instruments are determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including 

discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative this analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives including the period to maturity and uses observable marketbased inputs including interest rate curves the fair values of interest rate swaps are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash payments or receipts and the discounted expected variable cash receipts or payments the variable cash receipts or payments are based on an expectation of future interest rates forward curves derived from observable market interest rate curves in recent years these methodologies have produced materially accurate valuations 

derivative financial instruments we account for our derivative instruments in accordance with accounting standards for derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and hedging activities as amended and interpreted which establish accounting and reporting requirements for such instruments and activities these standards require that every derivative instrument be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value and that changes in the derivatives fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met see fair value measurements above for a discussion of derivative valuations special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivatives gains and losses to either offset related results on the hedged item in the statement of operations or be accumulated in other comprehensive income and requires that a company formally document designate and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting we use derivative instruments to manage our exposure to changing interest rates primarily with interest rate swaps 

in addition to making valuation estimates we also bear the risk that certain derivative instruments that have been designated as hedges and currently meet the strict hedge accounting requirements may not qualify in the future as highly effective as defined as well as the risk that hedged transactions in cash flow hedging relationships may no longer be considered probable to occur further new interpretations and guidance related to these instruments may be issued in the future and we cannot predict the possible impact that such guidance may have on our use of derivative instruments going forward 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

financial risk management 

we are exposed to market risk primarily from adverse changes in interest rates and to a lesser degree commodity prices to minimize this risk we may periodically use financial instruments including derivatives as a matter of policy we do not buy or sell financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes and all derivative financial instrument transactions must be authorized and executed pursuant to approval by the board of directors all financial instrument positions taken by us are intended to be used to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure because of high correlation between the derivative financial instrument and the underlying exposure being hedged fluctuations in the value of the financial instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying economic exposure 

interest rate risk 

we manage our interest rate risk through the strategic use of fixed and variable interest rate debt and from time to time derivative financial instruments our principal interest rate exposure relates to outstanding amounts under our credit facilities as of february 3 2012 we had variable rate borrowings of 1964 billion under our term loan facility and 1847 million under our abl facility the maximum availability under our abl facility was increased to 12 billion on march 15 2012 as described above under liquidity and capital resources in order to mitigate a portion of the variable rate interest exposure under the credit facilities we entered into certain interest rate swaps which became effective on july 31 2007 pursuant to these swaps we swapped three month libor rates for 

fixed interest rates resulting in the payment of an allin fixed rate of 768 on an original notional amount of 20 billion originally scheduled to amortize on a quarterly basis until maturity at july 31 2012 

in october 2008 a counterparty to one of our 2007 swap agreements defaulted we terminated this agreement and in november 2008 we subsequently cash settled the swap representatives of the counterparty challenged our calculation of the cash settlement and this matter was settled in 2011 as described in legal proceedings under note 9 of the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements as of february 3 2012 the notional amount under the remaining 2007 swaps is 2333 million 

effective december 31 2008 we entered into a 4750 million interest rate swap in order to mitigate an additional portion of the variable rate interest exposure under the credit facilities this swap is scheduled to mature on january 31 2013 under the terms of this agreement we swapped one month libor rates for fixed interest rates resulting in the payment of a fixed rate of 506 on a notional amount of 4750 million through april 2010 4000 million from may 2010 through october 2011 and 3000 million to maturity 

a change in interest rates on variable rate debt impacts our pretax earnings and cash flows whereas a change in interest rates on fixed rate debt impacts the economic fair value of debt but not our pretax earnings and cash flows our interest rate swaps qualify for hedge accounting as cash flow hedges therefore changes in market fluctuations related to the effective portion of these cash flow hedges do not impact our pretax earnings until the accrued interest is recognized on the derivatives and the associated hedged debt based on our variable rate borrowing levels and interest rate swaps outstanding during 2011 and 2010 the annualized effect of a one percentage point change in variable interest rates would have resulted in a pretax reduction of our earnings and cash flows of approximately 163 million in 2011 and 93 million in 2010 

the conditions and uncertainties in the global credit markets have increased the credit risk of other counterparties to our swap agreements in the event such counterparties fail to perform under our swap agreements and we are unable to enter into new swap agreements on terms favorable to us our ability to effectively manage our interest rate risk may be materially impaired we attempt to manage counterparty credit risk by periodically evaluating the financial position and creditworthiness of such counterparties monitoring the amount for which we are at risk with each counterparty and where possible dispersing the risk among multiple counterparties there can be no assurance that we will manage or mitigate our counterparty credit risk effectively

business 

general 

we are the largest discount retailer in the united states by number of stores with 9414 stores located in 35 states as of february 25 2011 primarily in the southern southwestern midwestern and eastern united states we offer a broad selection of merchandise including consumables seasonal home products and apparel our merchandise includes high quality national brands from leading manufacturers as well as comparable quality private brand selections with prices at substantial discounts to national brands we offer our merchandise at everyday low prices typically 10 or less through our convenient smallbox approximately 7200 square feet locations

our history 

jl turner founded our company in 1939 as jl turner and son wholesale we were incorporated as a kentucky corporation under the name jl turner  son inc in 1955 when we opened our first dollar general store we changed our name to dollar general corporation in 1968 and reincorporated in 1998 as a tennessee corporation our common stock was publicly traded from 1968 until july 2007 when we merged with an entity controlled by investment funds affiliated with kohlberg kravis roberts  co lp or kkr on november 13 2009 our common stock again became publicly traded upon our completion of an initial public offering of 39215000 shares of our common stock including 22700000 newly issued shares we are majority owned by buck holdings lp a delaware limited partnership controlled by kkr which beneficially owns approximately 71 of our outstanding common stock

our business model 

our long history of profitable growth is founded on a commitment to a relatively simple business model providing a broad base of customers with their basic everyday and household needs supplemented with a variety of general merchandise items at everyday low prices in conveniently located smallbox stores

fiscal year 2010 represented our 21st consecutive year of samestore sales growth this growth regardless of economic conditions suggests that we have a less cyclical model than most retailers and we believe is a result of our compelling value and convenience proposition both customer traffic and average transaction amount increased during 2009 and 2010 despite a very difficult economic environment we believe that our customers recognize our efforts to provide them with a pleasant efficient shopping experience along with our ongoing commitment to meet their everyday needs which encourages them to continue to shop with us in the future 

our attractive store economics including a relatively low initial investment and simple low cost operating model have allowed us to grow our store base to over 9400 stores in 35 states and provide us significant opportunities to continue our strategy of profitable store growth 

compelling value and convenience proposition  our ability to deliver highly competitive prices on national brand and quality private brand products in convenient locations and our easy in and out shopping format create a compelling shopping experience that distinguishes us from other discount convenience and drugstore retailers our slogan “save time save money every day” summarizes our appeal to customers we believe our ability to effectively deliver both value and convenience allows us to succeed in small markets with limited shopping alternatives as well as to profitably coexist alongside larger retailers in more competitive markets our compelling value and convenience proposition is evidenced by the following attributes of our business model

·

convenient locations our stores are conveniently located in a variety of rural suburban and urban communities currently with nearly 70 serving communities with populations of less than 20000 in more densely populated areas our smallbox stores typically serve the closely surrounding neighborhoods the majority of our customers live within three to five miles or a 10minute drive of our stores our close proximity to customers drives customer loyalty and trip frequency and makes us an attractive alternative to large discount and other largebox retail and grocery stores which are often located farther away our low cost economic model enables us to serve many areas with fewer than 1500 households

·

timesaving shopping experience we also provide customers with a highly convenient shopping experience our stores’ smaller size allows us to locate parking near the front entrance where shopping carts are located to promote efficient navigation of the store our product offering includes most necessities such as basic packaged and refrigerated food and dairy products cleaning supplies paper products and health and beauty care items as well as greeting cards party supplies apparel housewares hardware and automotive supplies among others our typical store hours are 800 am to 900 pm seven days per week our convenient hours and broad merchandise offering allow our customers to fulfill their routine shopping requirements and minimize their need to shop elsewhere

·

everyday low prices on quality merchandise our research indicates that we offer a price advantage over most food and drug retailers and that our prices are highly competitive with even the largest discount retailers our ability to offer everyday low prices on quality merchandise is supported by our lowcost operating structure and our strategy to maintain a limited number of stock keeping units “skus” per category which we believe helps us maintain strong purchasing power most items are priced below 10 with approximately 24 at 1 or less we offer quality nationally advertised brands at these everyday low prices in addition to offering our own comparable quality private brands at value prices 

attractive store economics the traditional dollar general store size design and location requires minimal initial investment and low maintenance capital expenditures our typical locations involve a modest nofrills building which helps keep our rental and other fixed overhead costs relatively low when coupled with our new stores’ ability to generally deliver positive cash flow in the first year this low capital expenditure requirement typically results in pay back of capital in less than two years our stringent market analysis real estate site selection 

and new store approval processes as well as our new store marketing programs help us optimize financial returns and minimize the risks of opening unprofitable stores

our lean store staffing model and centralized management of utilities maintenance and supplies procurement contribute to our relatively low operating costs and efficient store operations 

substantial growth opportunities we believe that we have substantial growth opportunities through both improved profitability of existing stores and new store openings we are pursuing a number of initiatives which we expect to continue to improve the profitability of our existing store base in addition we have identified significant opportunities to add new stores in both existing and new markets we believe we have the longterm potential in the us to more than double our existing store base while maintaining strong returns on capital see ‘‘our growth strategy’’ for additional details

our growth strategy 

we believe we have the right strategy and execution capabilities to capitalize on the considerable growth opportunities afforded by our business model we believe we continue to have significant opportunities to drive profitable growth through increasing samestore sales expanding our operating profit rate and growing our store base

increasing samestore sales we believe the combination of our necessitydriven product mix and our attractive value proposition including a wellbalanced merchandising approach provides a strong basis for increased sales our average sales per square foot increased to 201 in 2010 from 195 in 2009 and 180 in 2008 we believe we will continue to have additional opportunities to increase our store productivity through improved instock positions price optimization continued improvements in space utilization and additional operating and merchandising initiatives among numerous additional projects in 2011 we plan to further expand our frozen and refrigerated food and health and beauty aids offerings we will also continue to focus on increasing sales in our home apparel and seasonal categories  

in addition we plan to relocate or remodel approximately 550 stores in 2011 which we expect to further drive samestore sales growth in 2010 we remodeled or relocated 504 stores remodels and relocations generally consist of updating the stores to our new customer centric format which we believe appeals to a broader customer base a relocation typically results in an improved more visible and accessible location and usually includes increased square footage we continue to have opportunities for additional remodels and relocations beyond 2011 

expanding operating profit rate another key component of our growth strategy is improving our operating profit rate through enhanced gross profit and expense reduction initiatives our financial results during 2010 and 2009 reflect the favorable impact of our strong category management processes on gross margin improvement and our continued efforts to reduce selling general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales 

in recent months we have begun to see many of our product categories impacted by increased costs of commodities including cotton wheat corn sugar coffee and resin as well as increased transportation fuel costs which have increased significantly in early 2011 these 

increases pose a challenge to our continued priority of improving our gross profit rate however we believe we have options available to mitigate the impact of these increases including our price optimization changes to our product selection such as alternate national brands and the expansion of our private brands and modifications to our packaging and product size including items in our planned expansion of merchandise selections priced at 100 in addition we continue to focus on reducing inventory shrinkage and improving distribution efficiencies 

we intend to continue to drive our private brand penetration going forward our private brand program complements our model of offering customers nationally branded consumables merchandise at everyday low prices generally private brand items have higher gross profit margins than similar national brand items and in 2010 represented approximately 22 of our consumables sales in 2010 we made significant progress in expanding our private brand efforts to our nonconsumable offerings dramatically improving the visual impact of our many nonconsumables including housewares domestics lawn and garden tools and summer toys

we believe we have the potential to directly source a larger portion of our products at significant savings to current costs in 2010 we imported approximately 750 million of goods or 8 of total purchases at cost 

we continually look for ways to improve our cost structure and enhance efficiencies throughout the organization in 2010 we centralized our procurement system which we expect to aid us in reducing the cost of purchases throughout the company in 2011 and beyond in addition we have begun to implement a store labor management and work simplification program and we are continuing our store rent reduction initiative

growing our store base  based on a detailed marketbymarket analysis we believe we have the potential to at least double our current number of stores through expansion in both existing and new markets in 2011 we plan to enter three new states connecticut new hampshire and nevada we have confidence in our real estate disciplines and in our ability to identify open and operate successful new stores as a result we believe that at least our present level of new store growth is sustainable for the foreseeable future in addition we continue to believe that in the current real estate market environment there may be opportunities to negotiate lower rent than would have previously been available allowing us to continue to improve the overall quality of our sites at attractive rental rates

our merchandise 

we offer a focused assortment of everyday necessities which drive frequent customer visits and key items in a broad range of general merchandise categories our product assortment provides the opportunity for our customers to address most of their basic shopping needs with one trip we sell high quality national brands from leading manufacturers such as procter  gamble kimberly clark unilever kellogg’s general mills nabisco cocacola and pepsico which are typically found at higher retail prices elsewhere additionally our private brand selections offer consumers even greater value with options to purchase value items and national brand equivalent products at substantial discounts to the national brand

our stores generally offer approximately 10000 total skus per store the number of skus in a given store can vary based upon the store’s size geographic location merchandising initiatives seasonality and other factors most of our products are priced at 10 or less with approximately 24 at 1 or less we separate our merchandise into four categories 1 consumables 2 seasonal 3 home products and 4 apparel

consumables is our largest category and includes paper and cleaning products such as paper towels bath tissue paper dinnerware trash and storage bags laundry and other home cleaning supplies food including packaged food and perishables such as cereals canned soups and vegetables sugar flour milk eggs and bread beverages and snacks including candy cookies crackers salty snacks and carbonated beverages health and beauty including overthecounter medicines and personal care products such as soap body wash shampoo dental hygiene and foot care products and pet including pet supplies and pet food

seasonal products include decorations toys batteries small electronics greeting cards stationery prepaid cell phones and accessories gardening supplies hardware automotive and home office supplies 

home products includes kitchen supplies cookware small appliances light bulbs storage containers frames candles craft supplies and kitchen bed and bath soft goods 

apparel includes casual everyday apparel for infants toddlers girls boys women and men as well as socks underwear disposable diapers shoes and accessories 

the percentage of net sales of each of our four categories of merchandise for the fiscal years indicated below was as follows

 

our home products and seasonal categories typically account for the highest gross profit margins and the consumables category typically accounts for the lowest gross profit margin

the dollar general store 

the average dollar general store has approximately 7200 square feet of selling space and is typically operated by a manager an assistant manager and three or more sales clerks approximately 58 of our stores are in freestanding buildings 41 in strip shopping centers and 1 are in downtown buildings most of our customers live within three to five miles or a 10 minute drive of our stores our store strategy features low initial capital expenditures limited maintenance capital low occupancy and operating costs and a focused merchandise offering within a broad range of categories allowing us to deliver low retail prices while generating strong cash flows and investment returns in 2010 the average cost of equipment and fixtures in our leased stores was approximately 165000 initial inventory net of payables increases the investment in a new store by approximately 75000

we generally have not encountered difficulty locating suitable store sites in the past given the size of the communities that we target we believe that there is ample opportunity for new store growth in existing and new markets in addition the current real estate market is providing an opportunity for us to access higher quality sites at lower rates than in recent years also we believe we have significant opportunities available for our relocation and remodel programs we spend approximately 75000 for equipment and fixtures to remodel a store and approximately 140000 to relocate one we remodeled or relocated 504 stores in 2010 450 in 2009 and 404 in 2008

our recent store growth is summarized in the following table

our customers seek value and convenience depending on their financial situation and geographic proximity customers’ reliance on dollar general varies from fillin shopping to periodic routine trips in order to stock up on household items to weekly or more frequent trips to meet most essential needs we believe that our value and convenience proposition attracts customers from a wide range of income brackets and life stages in the last year we have seen increases in the annual number of shopping trips that our customers make to dollar general as well as the amount spent during each trip

we continue to focus on the quality selection and pricing of our merchandise targeted advertising improved store standards and site selection processes among other initiatives to attract new and retain existing customers

our suppliers 

we purchase merchandise from a wide variety of suppliers and maintain direct buying relationships with many producers of national brand merchandise such as procter  gamble kimberly clark unilever kellogg’s general mills nabisco cocacola and pepsico despite our broad offering we maintain only a limited number of skus per category giving us a pricing advantage in dealing with our suppliers approximately 9 and 7 of our purchases in 2010 were from our largest and second largest suppliers respectively our private brands come from a diversified supplier base we directly imported approximately 8 of our purchases at cost 13 of our purchases at retail in 2010 our vendor arrangements generally provide for payment for such merchandise in us dollars

we have not experienced any difficulty in obtaining sufficient quantities of core merchandise and believe that if one or more of our current sources of supply became unavailable we would generally be able to obtain alternative sources without experiencing a substantial disruption of our business however such alternative sources could increase our 

merchandise costs or reduce the quality of our merchandise and an inability to obtain alternative sources could adversely affect our sales

distribution transportation and inventory management 

our stores are supported by nine distribution centers located strategically throughout our geographic footprint of these nine we own six and lease the other three we lease additional temporary warehouse space as necessary to support our distribution needs to support our growth we are in the process of constructing our tenth distribution center near birmingham alabama we expect this new distribution center to be operational in 2012 over the past few years we have made significant investments in facilities technological improvements and upgrades and we continue to improve work processes all of which increase our efficiency and ability to support our merchandising and operations initiatives as well as our new store growth we continually analyze and rebalance the network to ensure that it remains efficient and provides the service our stores require see ‘‘—properties’’ for additional information pertaining to our distribution centers

most of our merchandise flows through our distributions centers and is delivered to our stores by thirdparty trucking firms utilizing our trailers our agreements with these trucking firms are based on estimated costs of diesel fuel with the difference in estimated and current market fuel costs passed through to us the costs of diesel fuel are significantly influenced by international political and economic circumstances and have risen in recent months including considerable increases in early 2011 if such increased prices remain in effect or if further price increases were to arise for any reason including fuel supply shortages or unusual price volatility the resulting higher fuel prices could materially increase our transportation costs 

in addition we believe that there remains opportunity to improve our inventory turns initiatives in process include operational efforts to optimize presentation levels and decrease excess quantities shipped to our stores we continue to focus on sku optimization in an attempt to ensure that we can meet our customers’ demands for our most popular products as well as for product assortment we are also in the early stages of implementing an improved supply chain solution to assist in ordering monitoring and tracking inventory from purchase order to receipt to maintain efficient levels of inventory we turned our inventory approximately 52 times over the most recent four quarters

seasonality 

our business is seasonal to a certain extent generally our highest sales volume occurs in the fourth quarter which includes the christmas selling season and the lowest occurs in the first quarter in addition our quarterly results can be affected by the timing of new store openings and store closings the amount of sales contributed by new and existing stores as well as the timing of certain holidays we purchase substantial amounts of inventory in the third quarter and incur higher shipping costs and higher payroll costs in anticipation of the increased sales activity during the fourth quarter in addition we carry merchandise during our fourth quarter that we do not carry during the rest of the year such as gift sets holiday decorations certain baking items and a broader assortment of toys and candy

the following table reflects the seasonality of net sales gross profit and net income loss by quarter for each of the quarters of our three most recent fiscal years all of the quarters reflected below are comprised of 13 weeks

 

a

includes expenses net of income taxes of 829 million related to our initial public offering during the fourth quarter of 2009

b

includes expenses net of income taxes of 374 million related to the settlement of a shareholder lawsuit during the third quarter of 2008

our competition 

we operate in the basic discount consumer goods market which is highly competitive with respect to price store location merchandise quality assortment and presentation instock consistency and customer service we compete with discount stores and with many other retailers including mass merchandise grocery drug convenience variety and other specialty stores these other retail companies operate stores in many of the areas where we operate and many of them engage in extensive advertising and marketing efforts our direct competitors include family dollar dollar tree fred’s 99 cents only and various local independent operators as well as walmart walgreens cvs rite aid target and costco among others certain of our competitors have greater financial distribution marketing and other resources than we do

we differentiate ourselves from other forms of retailing by offering consistently low prices in a convenient smallstore format we believe that our prices are competitive due in part to our low cost operating structure and the relatively limited assortment of products offered historically we have minimized labor by offering fewer price points and a reliance on simple merchandise presentation purchasing large volumes of merchandise within our focused assortment in each merchandise category allows us to keep our average costs low contributing to our ability to offer competitive everyday low prices to our customers see “—our business model” above for further discussion of our competitive situation

our employees 

as of february 25 2011 we employed approximately 85900 fulltime and parttime employees including divisional and regional managers district managers store managers other store personnel and distribution center and administrative personnel we have increasingly focused on recruiting training motivating and retaining employees and we believe that the quality performance and morale of our employees have increased as a result we currently are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements

 item 1a 

risk factors 

you should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information contained in this report and other filings that we make from time to time with the sec including our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations or liquidity in addition the risks described below are not the only risks we face our business financial condition results of operations or liquidity could also be adversely affected by additional factors that apply to all companies generally as well as other risks that are not currently known to us or that we currently view to be immaterial while we attempt to mitigate known risks to the extent we believe to be practicable and reasonable we can provide no assurance and we make no representation that our mitigation efforts will be successful

current economic conditions and other economic factors may adversely affect our financial performance and other aspects of our business 

we believe that many of our customers are on fixed or low incomes and generally have limited discretionary spending dollars a further slowdown in the economy or a delayed recovery or other economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as increased unemployment or underemployment levels inflation increases in fuel or other energy costs and interest rates lack of available credit consumer debt levels higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws and further erosion in consumer confidence may adversely affect our business by reducing our customers’ spending or by causing them to shift their spending to products other than those sold by us or to products sold by us that are less profitable than other product choices all of which could result in lower net sales decreases in inventory turnover greater markdowns on inventory and a reduction in profitability due to lower margins many of those factors as well as commodity rates transportation costs including the costs of diesel fuel costs of labor insurance and healthcare foreign exchange rate fluctuations lease costs measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade changes in other laws and regulations and other economic factors also affect our cost of goods sold and our selling general and administrative expenses which may adversely affect our sales or profitability we have limited or no ability to control many of these factors we saw product costs begin to escalate in our 2010 fourth quarter as a result of increases in the costs of certain commodities including cotton wheat corn sugar coffee resin and increasing diesel fuel costs we will be diligent in our efforts to keep product costs as low as possible in the face of these increases while still working to optimize gross profit and meet the needs of our customers

in addition many of the factors discussed above along with current global economic conditions and uncertainties the potential for additional failures or realignments of financial institutions and the related impact on available credit may affect us and our suppliers and other business partners landlords and service providers in an adverse manner including but not limited to reducing access to liquid funds or credit increasing the cost of credit limiting our ability to manage interest rate risk increasing the risk of bankruptcy of our suppliers landlords or counterparties to or other financial institutions involved in our credit facilities and our derivative and other contracts increasing the cost of goods to us and other adverse consequences which we are unable to fully anticipate or control 

our plans depend significantly on initiatives designed to increase sales and improve the efficiencies costs and effectiveness of our operations and failure to achieve or sustain these plans could affect our performance adversely 

we have initiatives such as those relating to marketing merchandising promotions sourcing shrink private brand store operations and real estate in various stages of testing evaluation and implementation upon which we expect to rely to continue to improve our results of operations and financial condition and to achieve our financial plans these initiatives are inherently risky and uncertain even when tested successfully in their application to our business in general it is possible that successful testing can result partially from resources and attention that cannot be duplicated in broader implementation particularly in light of the diverse geographic locations of our stores and the fact that our field management is so decentralized general implementation also may be negatively affected by other risk factors described herein successful systemwide implementation relies on consistency of training stability of workforce ease of execution and the absence of offsetting factors that can influence results adversely failure to achieve successful implementation of our initiatives or the cost of these initiatives exceeding management’s estimates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

in addition the success of our merchandising initiatives particularly those with respect to nonconsumable merchandise depends in part upon our ability to predict consistently and successfully the products our customers will demand and to identify and timely respond to evolving trends in demographics and consumer preferences expectations and needs if we are unable to select products that are attractive to customers to obtain such products at costs that allow us to sell them at a profit or to effectively market such products our sales market share and profitability could be adversely affected if our merchandising efforts in the nonconsumables area are unsuccessful we could be further adversely affected by our inability to offset the lower margins associated with our consumables business

we face intense competition that could limit our growth opportunities and adversely impact our financial performance 

the retail business is highly competitive we operate in the basic discount consumer goods market which is competitive with respect to price store location merchandise quality assortment and presentation instock consistency and customer service this competitive environment subjects us to the risk of adverse impact to our financial performance because of the lower prices and thus the lower margins required to maintain our competitive position also companies like ours operating in the basic discount consumer goods market due to customer demographics and other factors may have limited ability to increase prices in response to increased costs without losing competitive position this limitation may adversely affect our margins and financial performance we compete for customers employees store sites products and services and in other important aspects of our business with many other local regional and national retailers we compete with retailers operating discount mass merchandise outlet warehouse club grocery drug convenience variety and other specialty stores certain of our competitors have greater financial distribution marketing and other resources than we do and may be able to secure better arrangements with suppliers than we can these other competitors 

compete in a variety of other ways including aggressive promotional activities merchandise selection and availability services offered to customers location store hours instore amenities and price if we fail to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets it could adversely affect our financial performance

competition for customers has intensified in recent years as larger competitors have moved into or increased their presence in our geographic markets in addition some of our large box competitors are or may be developing small box formats which may produce more competition we remain vulnerable to the marketing power and high level of consumer recognition of these larger competitors and to the risk that these competitors or others could venture into our industry in a significant way generally we expect an increase in competition

our private brands may not achieve or maintain broad market acceptance and increase the risks we face 

we have substantially increased the number of our private brand items and the program is a sizable part of our future growth plans we believe that our success in gaining and maintaining broad market acceptance of our private brands depends on many factors including pricing our costs quality and customer perception we may not achieve or maintain our expected sales for our private brands as a result our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected

a significant disruption to our distribution network or to the timely receipt of inventory could adversely impact sales or increase our transportation costs which would decrease our profits 

we rely on our distribution and transportation network to provide goods to our stores in a timely and costeffective manner through deliveries to our distribution centers from vendors and then from the distribution centers or direct ship vendors to our stores by various means of transportation including shipments by sea and truck any disruption unanticipated expense or operational failure related to this process could affect store operations negatively for example unexpected delivery delays or increases in transportation costs including through increased fuel costs or a decrease in transportation capacity for overseas shipments could significantly decrease our ability to make sales and earn profits in addition labor shortages or work stoppages in the transportation industry or longterm disruptions to the national and international transportation infrastructure that lead to delays or interruptions of deliveries could negatively affect our business

we maintain a network of distribution facilities and have plans to build new facilities to support our growth objectives delays in opening distribution centers could adversely affect our future operations by slowing store growth which may in turn reduce revenue growth in addition the planned construction of a new distribution center in 2011 and any future distributionrelated construction or expansion projects entail risks which could cause delays and cost overruns such as shortages of materials shortages of skilled labor or work stoppages unforeseen construction scheduling engineering environmental or geological problems weather interference fires or other casualty losses and unanticipated cost increases the 

completion date and ultimate cost of this or future projects could differ significantly from initial expectations due to constructionrelated or other reasons we cannot guarantee that any project will be completed on time or within established budgets

rising fuel costs could materially adversely affect our business 

fuel prices have risen considerably in recent months and are significantly influenced by international political and economic circumstances these increases pose a challenge to our continued priority of improving our gross profit rate if such increased prices remain in effect or if further price increases were to arise for any reason including fuel supply shortages or unusual price volatility the resulting higher fuel prices could materially increase our transportation costs adversely affecting our gross profit and results of operations in addition competitive pressures in our industry may have the effect of inhibiting our ability to reflect these increased costs in the prices of our products we will be diligent in our efforts to keep product costs as low as possible in the face of these increases while still working to optimize gross profit and meet the needs of our customers

risks associated with or faced by the domestic and foreign suppliers from whom our products are sourced could adversely affect our financial performance 

the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers in fact our largest supplier accounted for 9 of our purchases in 2010 and our next largest supplier accounted for approximately 7 of such purchases we have not experienced any difficulty in obtaining sufficient quantities of core merchandise and believe that if one or more of our current sources of supply became unavailable we would generally be able to obtain alternative sources without experiencing a substantial disruption of our business however such alternative sources could increase our merchandise costs and reduce the quality of our merchandise and an inability to obtain alternative sources could adversely affect our sales

we directly imported approximately 8 of our purchases measured at cost in 2010 but many of our domestic vendors directly import their products or components of their products changes to the prices and flow of these goods for any reason such as political and economic instability in the countries in which foreign suppliers are located the financial instability of suppliers suppliers’ failure to meet our standards issues with labor practices of our suppliers or labor problems they may experience such as strikes the availability and cost of raw materials to suppliers merchandise quality or safety issues currency exchange rates transport availability and cost inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located or from which they import are beyond our control and could adversely affect our operations and profitability because a substantial amount of our imported merchandise comes from china a change in the chinese currency or other policies could negatively impact our merchandise costs in addition the united states’ foreign trade policies tariffs and other impositions on imported goods trade sanctions imposed on certain countries the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control disruptions due to labor stoppages strikes or slowdowns or other disruptions involving our vendors or the transportation and handling industries also may negatively affect our ability to receive 

merchandise and thus may negatively affect sales these and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our financial performance as we increase our imports of merchandise from foreign vendors the risks associated with foreign imports will increase

product liability and food safety claims could adversely affect our business reputation and financial performance 

despite our best efforts to ensure the quality and safety of the products we sell we may be subject to product liability claims from customers or penalties from government agencies relating to products including food products that are recalled defective or otherwise alleged to be harmful such claims may result from tampering by unauthorized third parties product contamination or spoilage including the presence of foreign objects substances chemicals other agents or residues introduced during the growing storage handling and transportation phases all of our vendors and their products must comply with applicable product and food safety laws we generally seek contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from our suppliers however if we do not have adequate contractual indemnification andor insurance available such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations our ability to obtain indemnification from foreign suppliers may be hindered by the manufacturers’ lack of understanding of us product liability or other laws which may make it more likely that we be required to respond to claims or complaints from customers as if we were the manufacturer of the products even with adequate insurance and indemnification such claims could significantly damage our reputation and consumer confidence in our products our litigation expenses could increase as well which also could have a materially negative impact on our results of operations even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued

we are subject to governmental regulations procedures and requirements a significant change in or noncompliance with these regulations could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance 

our business is subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations we routinely incur costs in complying with these regulations new laws or regulations particularly those dealing with healthcare reform product safety and labor and employment among others or changes in existing laws and regulations particularly those governing the sale of products may result in significant added expenses or may require extensive system and operating changes that may be difficult to implement andor could materially increase our cost of doing business in addition such changes or new laws may require the write off and disposal of existing product inventory resulting in significant adverse financial impact to us untimely compliance or noncompliance with applicable regulations or untimely or incomplete execution of a required product recall can result in the imposition of penalties including loss of licenses or significant fines or monetary penalties in addition to reputational damage

litigation may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business is subject to the risk of litigation by employees consumers suppliers competitors shareholders government agencies and others through private actions class actions administrative proceedings regulatory actions or other litigation the number of employmentrelated class actions filed each year has continued to increase and recent changes and proposed changes in federal and state laws may cause claims to rise even more the outcome of litigation particularly class action lawsuits regulatory actions and intellectual property claims is difficult to assess or quantify plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to these lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time in addition certain of these lawsuits if decided adversely to us or settled by us may result in liability material to our financial statements as a whole or may negatively affect our operating results if changes to our business operation are required the cost to defend future litigation may be significant there also may be adverse publicity associated with litigation that could negatively affect customer perception of our business regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable as a result litigation may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding certain of these pending matters

if we cannot open new stores profitably and on schedule our planned future growth will be impeded which would adversely affect sales 

our ability to open profitable new stores is a key component of our planned future growth our ability to timely open such stores and to expand into additional market areas depends in part on the following factors the availability of attractive store locations the absence of occupancy delays the ability to negotiate acceptable lease and development terms the ability to hire and train new personnel especially store managers in a cost effective manner the ability to identify customer demand in different geographic areas general economic conditions and the availability of sufficient funds for expansion many of these factors affect our ability to successfully relocate stores and many of them are beyond our control in addition our credit ratings combined with tighter lending practices have made financing more challenging for our real estate developers in today’s market these unfavorable lending trends could potentially impact the timing of our store openings and buildtosuit program 

 

delays or failures in opening new stores or achieving lower than expected sales in new stores or drawing a greater than expected proportion of sales in new stores away from existing stores could materially adversely affect our growth andor profitability in addition we may not anticipate all of the challenges imposed by the expansion of our operations and as a result may not meet our targets for opening new stores remodeling or relocating stores or expanding profitably

some of our new stores may be located in areas where we have little or no meaningful experience or brand recognition those markets may have different competitive conditions market conditions consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns than our existing 

markets which may cause our new stores to be less successful than stores in our existing markets

many of our new stores will be located in areas where we have existing units although we have experience in these markets increasing the number of locations in these markets may result in inadvertent oversaturation of markets and temporarily or permanently divert customers and sales from our existing stores thereby adversely affecting our overall financial performance

natural disasters whether or not caused by climate change unusual weather conditions pandemic outbreaks terrorist acts and global political events could cause permanent or temporary distribution center or store closures impair our ability to purchase receive or replenish inventory or decrease customer traffic all of which could result in lost sales and otherwise adversely affect our financial performance 

the occurrence of one or more natural disasters such as hurricanes fires floods and earthquakes whether or not caused by climate change unusual weather conditions pandemic outbreaks terrorist acts or disruptive global political events such as civil unrest in countries in which our suppliers are located or similar disruptions could adversely affect our operations and financial performance to the extent these events result in the closure of one or more of our distribution centers a significant number of stores or our corporate headquarters or impact one or more of our key suppliers our operations and financial performance could be materially adversely affected through an inability to make deliveries or provide other support functions to our stores and through lost sales in addition these events could result in increases in fuel or other energy prices or a fuel shortage delays in opening new stores the temporary lack of an adequate work force in a market the temporary or longterm disruption in the supply of products from some domestic and overseas suppliers the temporary disruption in the transport of goods from overseas delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution centers or stores the temporary reduction in the availability of products in our stores and disruption of our utility services or to our information systems these events also can have indirect consequences such as increases in the costs of insurance if they result in significant loss of property or other insurable damage

material damage to or interruptions to our information systems as a result of external factors staffing shortages and difficulties in updating our existing technology or developing or implementing new technology could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 

we depend on a variety of information technology systems for the efficient functioning of our business such systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches and natural disasters damage or interruption to these systems may require a significant investment to fix or replace them and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim any material interruptions may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations

we also rely heavily on our information technology staff failure to meet these staffing needs may negatively affect our ability to fulfill our technology initiatives while continuing to provide maintenance on existing systems we rely on certain vendors to maintain and 

periodically upgrade many of these systems so that they can continue to support our business the software programs supporting many of our systems were licensed to us by independent software developers the inability of these developers or us to continue to maintain and upgrade these information systems and software programs would disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations if we were unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner in addition costs and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology such as the implementation of our new supply chain solution or with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems could also disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations

failure to attract and retain qualified employees particularly field store and distribution center managers and to control labor costs as well as other labor issues could adversely affect our financial performance 

our future growth and performance depends on our ability to attract retain and motivate qualified employees many of whom are in positions with historically high rates of turnover such as field managers and distribution center managers our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling our labor costs is subject to many external factors including competition for and availability of qualified personnel in a given market unemployment levels within those markets prevailing wage rates minimum wage laws health and other insurance costs and changes in employment and labor laws including changes in the process for our employees to join a union or other workplace regulation including changes in entitlement programs such as health insurance and paid leave programs to the extent a significant portion of our employee base unionizes or attempts to unionize our labor costs could increase in addition we are evaluating the potential future impact of recently enacted comprehensive healthcare reform legislation which will likely cause our healthcare costs to increase while the significant costs of the healthcare reform legislation will occur after 2013 due to provisions of the legislation being phased in over time changes to our healthcare costs structure could have a significant negative effect on our business our ability to pass along labor costs to our customers is constrained by our low price model

our profitability may be negatively affected by inventory shrinkage 

we are subject to the risk of inventory loss and theft we experience significant inventory shrinkage and we cannot assure you that incidences of inventory loss and theft will decrease in the future or that the measures we are taking will effectively address the problem of inventory shrinkage although some level of inventory shrinkage is an unavoidable cost of doing business if we were to experience higher rates of inventory shrinkage or incur increased security costs to combat inventory theft our financial condition could be affected adversely

our cash flows from operations may be negatively affected if we are not successful in managing our inventory balances 

our inventory balance represented approximately 45 of our total assets exclusive of goodwill and other intangible assets as of january 28 2011 efficient inventory management is a key component of our business success and profitability to be successful we must maintain sufficient inventory levels to meet our customers’ demands without allowing those levels to 

increase to such an extent that the costs to store and hold the goods unduly impacts our financial results if our buying decisions do not accurately predict customer trends or purchasing actions we may have to take unanticipated markdowns to dispose of the excess inventory which also can adversely impact our financial results we continue to focus on ways to reduce these risks but we cannot assure you that we will be successful in our inventory management if we are not successful in managing our inventory balances our cash flows from operations may be negatively affected

because our business is seasonal to a certain extent with the highest volume of net sales during the fourth quarter adverse events during the fourth quarter could materially affect our financial statements as a whole 

we generally recognize our highest volume of net sales during the christmas selling season which occurs in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year in anticipation of this holiday we purchase substantial amounts of seasonal inventory and hire many temporary employees an excess of seasonal merchandise inventory could result if our net sales during the christmas selling season were to fall below either seasonal norms or expectations if our fourth quarter sales results were substantially below expectations our financial performance and operating results could be adversely affected by unanticipated markdowns especially in seasonal merchandise lower than anticipated sales in the christmas selling season would also negatively affect our ability to absorb the increased seasonal labor costs

our current insurance program may expose us to unexpected costs and negatively affect our financial performance 

our insurance coverage reflects deductibles selfinsured retentions limits of liability and similar provisions that we believe are prudent based on the dispersion of our operations however there are types of losses we may incur but against which we cannot be insured or which we believe are not economically reasonable to insure such as losses due to acts of war employee and certain other crime and some natural disasters if we incur these losses and they are material our business could suffer certain material events may result in sizable losses for the insurance industry and adversely impact the availability of adequate insurance coverage or result in excessive premium increases to offset negative insurance market trends we may elect to selfinsure accept higher deductibles or reduce the amount of coverage in response to these market changes in addition we selfinsure a significant portion of expected losses under our workers’ compensation automobile liability general liability and group health insurance programs unanticipated changes in any applicable actuarial assumptions and management estimates underlying our recorded liabilities for these losses including expected increases in medical and indemnity costs could result in materially different expenses than expected under these programs which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition we are evaluating the potential future impact of recently enacted comprehensive healthcare reform legislation which may cause our healthcare costs to increase although we continue to maintain property insurance for catastrophic events at our store support center and distribution centers we are effectively selfinsured for other property losses if we experience a greater number of these losses than we anticipate our financial performance could be adversely affected

if we fail to protect our brand name competitors may adopt tradenames that dilute the value of our brand name 

we may be unable or unwilling to strictly enforce our trademarks in each jurisdiction in which we do business also we may not always be able to successfully enforce our trademarks against competitors or against challenges by others our failure to successfully protect our trademarks could diminish the value and efficacy of our brand recognition and could cause customer confusion which could in turn adversely affect our sales and profitability

our success depends on our executive officers and other key personnel if we lose key personnel or are unable to hire additional qualified personnel our business may be harmed 

our future success depends to a significant degree on the skills experience and efforts of our executive officers and other key personnel the loss of the services of any of our executive officers particularly richard w dreiling our chief executive officer could have a material adverse effect on our operations our future success will also depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and a failure to attract and retain new qualified personnel could have an adverse effect on our operations we do not currently maintain key person life insurance policies with respect to our executive officers or key personnel

we face risks related to protection of customers’ credit and debt card data and private data relating to us or our customers or employees 

in connection with credit card sales we transmit confidential credit and debit card information we also have access to collect or maintain private or confidential information regarding our customers and employees as well as our business we have procedures and technology in place to safeguard our customers’ debit and credit card information our employees’ private data and our confidential business information however third parties may have the technology or knowhow to breach the security of this information and our security measures and those of our technology vendors may not effectively prohibit others from obtaining improper access to this information a security breach of any kind could expose us to risks of data loss litigation government enforcement actions and costly response measures and could seriously disrupt our operations any resulting negative publicity could significantly harm our reputation which could cause us to lose market share and have an adverse effect in our financial results

while we have reduced our debt levels since 2007 we continue to have substantial debt that will need to be repaid or refinanced at or prior to applicable maturity dates which could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations and limit our ability to pursue our growth strategy or other opportunities or to react to changes in the economy or our industry 

at january 28 2011 we had total outstanding debt including the current portion of longterm obligations of 329 billion including a 1964 billion senior secured term loan facility which matures on july 6 2014 8643 million aggregate principal amount of 10625 senior notes due 2015 and 4507 million aggregate principal amount of 11875  12625 senior 

subordinated toggle notes due 2017 we also had an additional 9593 million available for borrowing under our senior secured assetbased revolving credit facility of up to 1031 billion which matures july 6 2013 this level of debt and our ability to repay or refinance this debt prior to maturity could have important negative consequences to our business including

·

increasing our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions because our debt payment obligations may limit our ability to use our cash to respond to or defend against changes in the industry or the economy

·

requiring a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness therefore reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations capital expenditures and future business opportunities or pay dividends

·

limiting our ability to pursue our growth strategy

·

placing us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less highly leveraged and may be better able to use their cash flow to fund competitive responses to changing industry market or economic conditions

·

limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures debt service requirements acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes and

·

increasing the difficulty of our ability to make payments on our outstanding debt

our variable rate debt exposes us to interest rate risk which could adversely affect our cash flow 

the borrowings under the term loan facility and the senior secured assetbased revolving credit facility comprise our credit facilities and bear interest at variable rates other debt we incur also could be variable rate debt if market interest rates increase variable rate debt will create higher debt service requirements which could adversely affect our cash flow while we have entered and may in the future enter into agreements limiting our exposure to higher interest rates any such agreements may not offer complete protection from this risk

our debt agreements contain restrictions that could limit our flexibility in operating our business 

our credit facilities and the indentures governing our notes contain various covenants that could limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions these covenants limit our and our restricted subsidiaries’ ability to among other things

·

incur additional indebtedness issue disqualified stock or issue certain preferred stock

·

pay dividends and make certain distributions investments and other restricted payments

·

create certain liens or encumbrances

·

sell assets

·

enter into transactions with our affiliates

·

allow payments to us by our restricted subsidiaries

·

merge consolidate sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets and

new accounting guidance or changes in the interpretation or application of existing accounting guidance could adversely affect our financial performance 

the implementation of proposed new accounting standards may require extensive systems internal process and other changes that could increase our operating costs and may also result in changes to our financial statements in particular the implementation of expected future accounting standards related to leases as currently being contemplated by the convergence project between the financial accounting standards board fasb and the international accounting standards board iasb as well as the possible adoption of international financial reporting standards by us registrants could require us to make significant changes to our lease management fixed asset and other accounting systems and in all likelihood would result in changes to our financial statements

us generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by our management changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments by our management could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance the outcome of such changes could include litigation or regulatory actions which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

this discussion and analysis should be read with and is qualified in its entirety by the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto it also should be read in conjunction with the cautionary disclosure regarding forwardlooking statements and the risk factors disclosures set forth in the introduction and in item 1a of this report respectively 

executive overview 

we are the largest discount retailer in the united states by number of stores with 9414 stores located in 35 states as of february 25 2011 primarily in the southern southwestern midwestern and eastern united states we offer a broad selection of merchandise including consumable products such as food paper and cleaning products health and beauty products and pet supplies and nonconsumable products such as seasonal merchandise home decor and domestics and apparel our merchandise includes high quality national brands from leading manufacturers as well as comparable quality private brand selections with prices at substantial discounts to national brands we offer our customers these national brand and private brand products at everyday low prices typically 10 or less in our convenient smallbox small store locations 

on july 6 2007 we completed a merger and as a result we are majority owned by buck holdings lp “buck” a delaware limited partnership controlled by investment funds affiliated with kohlberg kravis roberts  co lp collectively “kkr” the membership interests of buck and buck holdings llc “buck llc” the general partner of buck are held by a private investor group including affiliates of each of kkr and goldman sachs  co and other equity investors collectively the “investors” the merger consideration was funded through the use of our available cash cash equity contributions from the investors equity contributions of certain members of our management and certain debt financings discussed below under “liquidity and capital resources” in november 2009 we completed an initial public offering of approximately 392 million shares including 227 million newly issued shares and approximately 165 million outstanding shares sold by buck in april and december of 2010 we completed secondary offerings of approximately 299 million and 288 million shares 

respectively all of which were sold by selling shareholders we did not receive any proceeds from either of the secondary offerings in 2010

the customers we serve are valueconscious and dollar general has always been intensely focused on helping our customers make the most of their spending dollars we believe our convenient store format and broad selection of high quality products at compelling values have driven our substantial growth and financial success over the years like other companies we have been operating in an environment with heightened economic challenges and uncertainties consumers are facing very high rates of unemployment fluctuating food gasoline and energy costs rising medical costs and a continued weakness in housing and credit markets and the timetable for economic recovery is uncertain nonetheless as a result of our longterm mission of serving the valueconscious customer coupled with a vigorous focus on improving our operating and financial performance our 2010 and 2009 financial results were strong and we remain optimistic with regard to executing our operating priorities in 2011

at the beginning of 2008 we defined four operating priorities which we remain keenly focused on executing these priorities are 1 drive productive sales growth 2 increase our gross margins 3 leverage process improvements and information technology to reduce costs and 4 strengthen and expand dollar generals culture of serving others

our first priority is driving productive sales growth by increasing shopper frequency and transaction amount and maximizing sales per square foot our category management processes allow us to identify opportunities to add more productive items and remove unproductive items in a timely manner and have allowed us to continue expanding our consumables offerings while also improving profitability we raised the shelf height in our stores in three phases from 2008 through 2010 in order to utilize the space in our stores more productively we are adding a fourth phase in 2011 in addition we believe we have significant potential to grow sales through new store growth in both existing and new markets we opened 600 new stores in 2010 and plan to open approximately 625 new stores in 2011

our second priority is to increase gross profit through effective category management the expansion of private brand offerings and increased foreign sourcing shrink reduction distribution efficiencies and improvements to our pricing and markdown model while remaining committed to our everyday low price strategy we constantly review our pricing strategy and work diligently to minimize vendor cost increases as we focus on providing our customers quality merchandise at great values in our consumables category we strive to offer the optimal balance of the most popular nationally advertised brands and our own private brands which generally have higher gross profit rates than national brands in 2011 we expect increased product costs we saw the costs of certain commodities including cotton wheat corn sugar coffee resin and the costs of diesel fuel begin to escalate in our 2010 fourth quarter the market prices of these commodities including the cost of diesel fuel are outside of our control however we will be diligent in our efforts to keep product costs as low as possible in the face of these increases while still working to optimize gross profit and meet the needs of our customers

our third priority is leveraging process improvements and information technology to reduce costs we are committed as an organization to extract costs that do not affect the customer experience examples of ongoing cost reduction initiatives include the installation of 

energy management systems continued preventive maintenance with the goal of reducing overall repairs and maintenance costs and recycling of cardboard to reduce waste management costs our real estate team continues to seek out opportunities to negotiate favorable lease renewals we are focusing our information technology resources on improving systems to create greater efficiencies in merchandising and retail store operations evidenced by our intention to implement a new store staffing module in 2011 to better align store labor hours with our customer’s shopping needs in 2010 we centralized our procurement system which we expect to aid us in reducing the cost of purchases throughout the company in 2011 and beyond we plan to continue our diligent efforts with regard to our cost reduction initiatives in 2011

our fourth priority is to strengthen and expand dollar general’s culture of serving others for customers this means helping them “save time save money every day” by providing clean wellstocked stores with quality products at low prices for employees this means creating an environment that attracts and retains key employees throughout the organization for the public this means giving back to our store communities for shareholders this means meeting their expectations of an efficiently and profitably run organization that operates with compassion and integrity

for the year ended january 28 2011 our continued focus on our four priorities resulted in improved financial performance over the year ended january 29 2010 in each of our key financial metrics as follows basis points as referred to below are equal to 001 percent of total sales

·

total sales in fiscal 2010 increased 105 percent over 2009 sales in samestores increased 49 percent following a strong 95 percent increase in 2009 customer traffic and average transaction amount increased in both 2010 and 2009 average sales per square foot in 2010 were 201 up from 195 in 2009

·

gross profit as a percentage of sales was 320 percent in 2010 an increase of 76 basis points over 2009 this improvement was primarily attributable to increased purchase markups net of increased markdowns resulting from increased volume which enabled us to lower our average costs from vendors the improvement also reflected the continued impact of our comprehensive category management enhancements

·

sga as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2010 was 223 percent compared to 232 percent in 2009 sga in 2009 included incremental expenses of 683 million or 58 basis points resulting from the termination of our sponsor advisory agreement and the accelerated vesting of certain equitybased compensation related to our initial public offering sga in 2010 included incremental expenses of 197 million or 15 basis points resulting from costs related to two secondary offerings of our common stock during the year by certain of our shareholders excluding the impact of these costs sga as a percentage of sales declined primarily due to lower employee incentive compensation which is based on financial targets set at the beginning of each fiscal year our results exceeded those targets in 2010 but not to the same degree as in 2009 lower healthcare expense and the impact of other cost reduction and 

productivity initiatives which resulted in various expenses decreasing or increasing at a rate lower than the 105 percent increase in sales

·

interest expense decreased by 715 million in 2010 to 2742 million primarily as the result of lower average outstanding longterm obligations net proceeds from our initial public offering and excess cash were utilized in our fiscal 2009 fourth quarter to voluntarily reduce longterm obligations by 7259 million and in 2010 we repurchased an additional 1150 million of longterm obligations utilizing operating cash flow other nonoperating expenses include charges totaling 147 million in 2010 and 553 million in 2009 resulting from these repurchases

·

we reported net income of 6279 million or 182 per diluted share for fiscal 2010 compared to net income of 3394 million or 104 per diluted share in 2009 charges relating to secondary stock offerings by certain of our shareholders including the acceleration of certain equity appreciation rights and losses from the repurchase of longterm obligations reduced 2010 net income by 213 million or 006 per diluted share in 2009 charges resulting from the termination of our sponsor advisory agreement the acceleration of certain equitybased compensation and the repurchase of longterm obligations related to or resulting from our initial public offering reduced net income by 829 million or 026 per diluted share

·

we generated approximately 825 million of cash flows from operating activities in 2010 an increase of over 22 percent compared to 2009 cash flow was primarily utilized to support our capital expenditures and repurchase longterm obligations

·

during 2010 we opened 600 new stores remodeled or relocated 504 stores and closed 56 stores resulting in a store count of 9372 on january 28 2011

as discussed in more detail below in recent years we have generated significant cash flows from operating activities we have used a portion of these cash flows to pay down debt and to invest in new store growth through our traditional leased stores during 2010 we made a strategic decision to purchase certain of our leased stores we believe that the current environment in the real estate markets provides an opportunity to make these investments at levels which are expected to result in favorable returns and positively impact our operating results we initiated the store purchase program in the second half of 2010 and have plans to purchase additional stores during 2011

like other companies we face uncertainties with regard to the future impact of healthcare reform legislation including the patient protection and affordable care act and the healthcare and education reconciliation act of 2010 signed into law in march 2010 which will likely affect the cost associated with employersponsored medical plans specifically this legislation requires that employers provide a minimum level of coverage for fulltime employees or pay penalties some of the plan coverage requirements may have an impact on our costs such as bans on exclusions for preexisting conditions extension of dependent coverage to age 26 and caps on employee premium sharing costs certain coverage provisions do not go into effect until 2014 but there are a number of dependent coverage and insurance market reforms that took 

effect immediately although this legislation did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements in 2010 we continue to evaluate the impact it will have on our costs in future years and those costs could be material due to the breadth and complexity of the healthcare reform legislation the current lack of implementing regulations and interpretive guidance the phasedin nature of the implementation and uncertainty with respect to the outcome of pending litigation with respect to the legislation it is difficult to predict its overall impact on our business in the coming years

in 2011 we plan to continue to focus on our four key operating priorities we will continue to refine and improve our store standards in order to increase sales focusing on achieving a consistent look and feel across the chain we have begun and will continue to measure customer satisfaction which will allow us to identify areas needing improvement we expect to continue the process of raising the height of certain merchandise fixtures allowing us to better utilize our store square footage as part of our overall category management processes we plan to further expand our private brand consumables offerings and to continue to upgrade the selection quality and presentation of our private brand offerings in our apparel seasonal and home categories and we expect a greater impact on gross margin from our foreign sourcing efforts in 2011 as noted above we expect cost increases in certain commodities including diesel fuel to present a challenge as we focus on improving our gross profit rate while managing our everyday low prices

we now have improved processes and tools in place to assist us in our ongoing inventory shrink reduction efforts our work on shrink remains a high priority and we plan to use the information supplied by these analytical and monitoring tools to help improve on our recent successes

with regard to leveraging information technology and process improvements to reduce costs we will continue to focus on making improvements that benefit our merchandising and operations efforts including item profitability analysis merchandise selection and allocation and labor scheduling in 2010 we completed the installation of back office computers in all of our stores which we will utilize to improve reporting and communications with the stores and consequently we believe will assist in improving store productivity also in 2010 we completed the rollout of a new voice pick system in our distribution centers allowing our distribution associates to communicate with warehouse software systems using speech recognition

finally we are very pleased with the performance of our 2010 new stores remodels and relocations and in 2011 we plan to increase our new store openings to 625 stores within the 35 states in which we currently operate as well as three new states connecticut nevada and new hampshire and to increase our number of remodels or relocations to an additional 550 stores with regard to planned new store openings our criteria are based on numerous factors including among other things availability of appropriate sites expected sales lease terms population demographics competition and the employment environment we use various real estate site selection tools to determine target markets and optimum site locations within those markets with respect to store relocations we begin to evaluate a store for relocation opportunities approximately 18 months prior to the store’s lease expiration using the same basic tools and criteria as those used for new stores remodels which require a much smaller investment are 

determined based on the need the opportunity for sales improvement at the location and an expectation of a desirable return on investment

seasonality  the nature of our business is seasonal to a certain extent primarily because of sales of holidayrelated merchandise sales in our fourth quarter november december and january have historically been higher than sales achieved in each of the first three quarters of the fiscal year expenses and to a greater extent operating profit vary by quarter results of a period shorter than a full year may not be indicative of results expected for the entire year furthermore the seasonal nature of our business may affect comparisons between periods

the following table contains results of operations data for fiscal years 2010 2009 and 2008 and the dollar and percentage variances among those years

 

net sales  the net sales increase in 2010 reflects a samestore sales increase of 49 compared to 2009 samestores include stores that have been open for 13 months and remain open at the end of the reporting period for 2010 there were 8712 samestores which accounted for sales of 1223 billion the remainder of the increase in sales in 2010 was attributable to new stores partially offset by sales from closed stores the increase in sales reflects the continued refinement of our merchandise offerings the optimization of our category management processes further improvement in store standards and increased utilization of square footage in our stores

the net sales increase in 2009 reflects a samestore sales increase of 95 compared to 2008 for 2009 there were 8324 samestores which accounted for sales of 1136 billion the 

remainder of the increase in sales in 2009 was attributable to new stores partially offset by sales from closed stores the strong increase in sales reflects the results of our various initiatives implemented throughout 2008 and 2009 including the impact of improved store standards the expansion of our merchandise offerings including significant enhancements to our convenience food and beverages and health and beauty products in addition to improved utilization of square footage extended store hours and improved marketing efforts 

of our four major merchandise categories the consumables category has grown most significantly over the past several years although this category generally has a lower gross profit rate than the other three categories as discussed below we were able to increase our overall gross profit rate in both 2010 and 2009 as compared to the previous year because of the impact of sales mix on gross profit we continually review our merchandise mix and strive to adjust it when appropriate maintaining an appropriate sales mix is an integral part of achieving our gross profit and sales goals both the number of customer transactions and average transaction amount increased in 2010 and 2009 and we believe that our stores have benefited to some degree from attracting new customers who are seeking value as a result of the recent economic environment

gross profit  the gross profit rate as a percentage of sales was 320 in 2010 compared to 313 in 2009 factors contributing to the increase in the 2010 gross profit rate include increased markups resulting primarily from higher purchase markups partially offset by increased markdowns as well as our category management efforts and increased sales volumes which have contributed to our ability to reduce purchase costs from our vendors our merchandising team continues to work closely with our vendors to provide quality merchandise at value prices to meet our customers’ demands in 2010 we recorded a lifo provision of 53 million reflecting an increase in certain merchandise costs the most significant of which occurred in the 2010 fourth quarter compared to a lifo benefit of 25 million in 2009

the gross profit rate as a percentage of sales was 313 in 2009 compared to 293 in 2008 factors contributing to the increase in the 2009 gross profit rate include increased markups resulting primarily from higher purchase markups partially offset by increased markdowns in addition our increased sales volumes have contributed to our ability to reduce purchase costs from our vendors transportation and distribution costs decreased for the year driven by lower fuel costs as well as the impact of cost reduction initiatives higher sales volumes and productivity initiatives also contributed to improved leverage of our distribution costs in addition inventory shrinkage as a percentage of sales declined in 2009 from 2008 contributing to our gross profit rate improvement in 2009 we recorded a lifo benefit of 25 million reflecting a flattening of merchandise costs in 2009 compared to a lifo provision of 439 million in 2008 when we faced increased commodity cost pressures mainly related to food and pet products which were driven by rising fruit and vegetable prices and freight costs increases in petroleum resin metals pulp and other raw material commodity driven costs also resulted in multiple product cost increases in 2008 also in 2008 we marked down merchandise as the result of our interpretation of the phthalates provision of the consumer product safety improvement act of 2008 resulting in a charge of 86 million

selling general and administrative “sga” expense sga expense was 223 as a percentage of sales in 2010 compared to 232 in 2009 a decrease of 93 basis points sga in 

2010 included expenses totaling 197 million or 15 basis points relating to two secondary offerings of our common stock consisting of 11 million of legal and other transaction expenses and 186 million relating to the acceleration of certain equity appreciation rights sga in 2009 included expenses totaling 683 million or 58 basis points including 588 million relating to the termination of an advisory agreement among us kkr and goldman sachs  co and 94 million resulting from the acceleration of certain equity based compensation related to the completion of our initial public offering decreases in incentive compensation the cost of health benefits consulting fees and severance costs contributed to the overall decrease in sga as a percentage of sales as did other cost reduction and productivity initiatives other costs increasing at a rate lower than our 105 increase in sales include utilities which reflect lower waste management costs resulting from our recycling efforts as well as repairs and maintenance our increased sales levels in 2010 also favorably impacted sga as a percentage of sales debit card fees increased at a higher rate than the increase in sales primarily as a result of increased usage

sga as a percentage of sales was 232 in 2009 compared to 234 in 2008 representing an improvement of 21 basis points before taking into account the impact of our initial public offering as discussed above our increased sales levels in 2009 favorably impacted sga as a percentage of sales with the most significant impact on store occupancy costs including rent and utilities our cost of utilities as a percentage of sales was further reduced by energy savings resulting from our store energy management initiatives including forward purchase contracts increased preventive maintenance and the installation of energy management systems in substantially all of our new and relocated stores in addition we continued to significantly reduce our workers’ compensation expense through safety initiatives implemented over the last several years and legal expenses were lower in 2009 than 2008 which included expenses incurred in connection with a shareholder litigation settlement in 2008 relating to our 2007 merger also during 2008 we recorded a 50 million gain relating to potential losses on distribution center leases indirectly related to our 2007 merger 

litigation settlement and related costs net expenses in 2008 included 320 million which represents the settlement of a class action lawsuit filed in response to our 2007 merger and includes a 400 million settlement plus related expenses of 20 million net of 100 million of insurance proceeds received in the fourth quarter of 2008

interest expense  the decrease in interest expense in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily the result of lower average outstanding longterm obligations the decrease in interest expense in 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily the result of lower average outstanding longterm obligations and lower interest rates on our term loan 

we had outstanding variablerate debt of 931 million and 560 million as of january 28 2011 and january 29 2010 respectively after taking into consideration the impact of interest rate swaps the remainder of our outstanding indebtedness at january 28 2011 and january 29 2010 was fixed rate debt 

see the detailed discussion under “liquidity and capital resources” regarding indebtedness incurred to finance our 2007 merger along with subsequent repurchases of various longterm obligations and the related effect on interest expense in the periods presented

other income expense in 2010 we recorded pretax losses of 147 million resulting from the repurchase in the open market of 1150 million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes plus accrued and unpaid interest

in 2009 we recorded charges totaling 555 million which primarily represents losses on debt retirement totaling 553 million and also includes expense of 06 million related to hedge ineffectiveness on certain of our interest rate swaps

in 2008 we recorded a gain of 38 million resulting from the repurchase of 441 million of our senior subordinated notes offset by expense of 10 million related to hedge ineffectiveness on certain of our interest rate swaps

income taxes  the effective income tax rates for 2010 2009 and 2008 were expenses of 363 385 and 444 respectively

the 2010 effective tax rate is greater than the expected tax rate of 35 due primarily to the inclusion of state income taxes in the total effective tax rate the 2010 effective rate is less than the 2009 rate due principally to reductions in state income tax expense income tax related interest expense and other expense items the 2010 effective resolution of various examinations by the taxing authorities when combined with unfavorable examination results in 2009 resulted in a decrease in the yeartoyear state income tax expense rate this decrease in state income tax expense was partially offset by an increase in state income tax expense due to a shift in income to companies within the group that have a higher effective state income tax rate in addition decreases also occurred due to favorable outcomes in 2010 associated with reductions in income tax related interest accruals and income tax related penalty accruals due to favorable income tax examination results the completion of a federal income tax examination and reductions in expense associated with uncertain tax benefit accruals

the 2009 effective tax rate is greater than the expected tax rate of 35 due primarily to the inclusion of state income taxes in the total effective tax rate the 2009 effective tax rate is less than the 2008 rate due principally to the unfavorable impact that the nondeductible mergerrelated lawsuit settlement had on the 2008 rate this reduction in the effective tax rate was partially offset by a decrease in the tax rate benefit related to federal jobs credits while the total amount of jobs credits earned in 2009 was similar to the amount earned in 2008 the impact of this benefit on the effective tax rate was reduced due to the 2009 increase in income before tax the 2009 rate was also increased by accruals associated with uncertain tax benefits

the 2008 effective income tax rate was greater than the expected tax rate of 35 principally due to the nondeductibility of the settlement and related expenses associated with the shareholder lawsuit related to our 2007 merger

off balance sheet arrangements 

we lease three of our distribution centers the entities involved in the ownership structure underlying these leases meet the accounting definition of a variable interest entity ‘‘vie’’ one of these distribution centers has been recorded as a financing obligation whereby its property and equipment are reflected in our consolidated balance sheets the land and 

buildings of the other two distribution centers have been recorded as operating leases we are not the primary beneficiary of these vies and accordingly have not included these entities in our consolidated financial statements other than the foregoing we are not party to any off balance sheet arrangements

effects of inflation 

in 2008 increased commodity cost pressures mainly related to food and pet products which were driven by fruit and vegetable prices and rising freight costs increased the costs of certain products increases in petroleum resin metals pulp and other raw material commodity driven costs also resulted in multiple product cost increases we believe that our ability to increase selling prices in response to cost increases largely mitigated the effect of these cost increases on our overall results of operations these 2008 trends generally reversed or stabilized in 2009 and 2010 

liquidity and capital resources 

current financial condition and recent developments 

during the past three years we have generated an aggregate of approximately 207 billion in cash flows from operating activities during that period we expanded the number of stores we operate by 1178 or over 14 remodeled or relocated 1358 stores or approximately 14 of stores we operated as of february 25 2011 and incurred approximately 877 million in capital expenditures we made certain strategic decisions which slowed our store growth in 2007 and 2008 but we reaccelerated store growth beginning in 2009 and currently plan to continue that strategy in 2011 and beyond

at january 28 2011 we had total outstanding debt including the current portion of longterm obligations of 329 billion we also had an additional 9593 million available for borrowing under our senior secured assetbased revolving credit facility “abl facility” and together with the term loan facility the “credit facilities” at that date our liquidity needs are significant primarily due to our debt service and other obligations our substantial debt could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry or to pursue our growth strategy expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt and increase the difficulty of our ability to make payments on our outstanding debt securities

nevertheless management believes our cash flow from operations and existing cash balances combined with availability under the credit facilities described below will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our current obligations projected working capital requirements and capital spending for a period that includes the next twelve months and the next several years

credit facilities 

overview we have two senior secured credit facilities which provide financing of up to 2995 billion as of january 28 2011 the credit facilities consist of the 1964 billion term loan facility and the 1031 billion abl facility of which up to 3500 million is available for 

letters of credit subject to borrowing base availability the abl facility includes borrowing capacity available for letters of credit and for shortterm borrowings referred to as swingline loans

the amount available under the abl facility including letters of credit shall not exceed the sum of the tranche a borrowing base and the tranche a1 borrowing base the tranche a borrowing base equals the sum of i 85 of the net orderly liquidation value of all our eligible inventory and that of each guarantor thereunder and ii 90 of all our accounts receivable and creditdebit card receivables and that of each guarantor thereunder in each case subject to customary reserves and eligibility criteria an additional 10 of the net orderly liquidation value of all of our eligible inventory and that of each guarantor thereunder is made available to us in the form of a “last out” tranche under which we may borrow up to a maximum amount of 1010 million borrowings under the abl facility will be incurred first under the last out tranche and no borrowings will be permitted under any other tranche until the last out tranche is fully utilized repayments of the abl facility will be applied to the last out tranche only after all other tranches have been fully paid down

interest rates and fees borrowings under the credit facilities bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus at our option either a libor or b a base rate which is usually equal to the prime rate the applicable margin for borrowings is i under the term loan facility 275 for libor borrowings and 175 for baserate borrowings ii under the abl facility except in the last out tranche described above as of january 28 2011 and january 29 2010 125 for libor borrowings 025 for baserate borrowings and for any last out borrowings 225 for libor borrowings and 125 for baserate borrowings the applicable margins for borrowings under the abl facility except in the case of last out borrowings are subject to adjustment each quarter based on average daily excess availability under the abl facility the interest rate for borrowings under the term loan facility was 30 without giving effect to the market rate swaps discussed below as of both january 28 2011 and january 29 2010 respectively we are also required to pay a commitment fee to the lenders under the abl facility for any unutilized commitments at a rate of 0375 per annum we also must pay customary letter of credit fees see item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” below for a discussion of our use of interest rate swaps to manage our interest rate risk

prepayments the senior secured credit agreement for the term loan facility requires us to prepay outstanding term loans subject to certain exceptions with

the mandatory prepayments discussed above will be applied to the abl facility as directed by the senior secured credit agreement for the abl facility through january 28 2011 no prepayments have been required under the prepayment provisions listed above

an event of default under the senior secured credit agreements will occur upon a change of control as defined in the senior secured credit agreements governing our credit facilities upon an event of default indebtedness under the credit facilities may be accelerated in which case we will be required to repay all outstanding loans plus accrued and unpaid interest and all other amounts outstanding under the credit facilities

amortization the original terms of the term loan facility required quarterly payments of principal beginning september 30 2009 as a result of voluntary prepayments under the term loan facility no further quarterly principal installments will be required prior to maturity of the term loan on july 6 2014 there is no amortization under the abl facility the entire principal amounts if any outstanding under the abl facility are due and payable in full at maturity on july 6 2013 on which day the commitments thereunder will terminate

at january 28 2011 we had no borrowings 527 million of standby letters of credit and 191 million of commercial letters of credit outstanding under our abl facility

senior notes due 2015 and senior subordinated toggle notes due 2017 

overview as of january 28 2011 we have 8643 million aggregate principal amount of 10625 senior notes due 2015 the “senior notes” outstanding reflected in our consolidated balance sheet net of a 112 million discount which mature on july 15 2015 pursuant to an indenture dated as of july 6 2007 the “senior indenture” and 4507 million aggregate principal amount of 1187512625 senior subordinated toggle notes due 2017 the “senior subordinated notes” outstanding which mature on july 15 2017 pursuant to an indenture dated as of july 6 2007 the “senior subordinated indenture” the senior notes and the senior subordinated notes are collectively referred to herein as the “notes” the senior indenture and the senior subordinated indenture are collectively referred to herein as the “indentures”

interest on the notes is payable on january 15 and july 15 of each year interest on the senior notes is payable in cash cash interest on the senior subordinated notes accrues at a rate of 11875 per annum for the senior subordinated notes we previously had the ability to elect to pay interest by increasing the principal amount of the senior subordinated notes or issuing new senior subordinated notes “pik interest” instead of paying cash interest due to the 

expiration of the notification period for such option all interest on the notes has been and will be paid in cash

the notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by each of the existing and future direct or indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries that guarantee the obligations under our credit facilities

we intend to redeem some or all of the senior notes at the first scheduled call date in july 2011 or later we may redeem some or all of the notes at any time at redemption prices described or set forth in the indentures we also may seek from time to time to retire some or all of the notes through cash purchases on the open market in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise such repurchases if any will depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors the amounts involved may be material we repurchased 1150 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding senior notes during 2010 in connection with our initial public offering in 2009 we redeemed 1957 million principal amount of outstanding senior notes and 2052 million principal amount of outstanding senior subordinated notes we repurchased 441 million and 250 million of senior subordinated notes in 2008 and 2007 respectively

change of control upon the occurrence of a change of control which is defined in the indentures each holder of the notes has the right to require us to repurchase some or all of such holder’s notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101 of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest if any to the repurchase date

events of default the indentures also provide for events of default which if any of them occurs would permit or require the principal of and accrued interest on the notes to become or to be declared due and payable

adjusted ebitda 

under the agreements governing the credit facilities and the indentures certain limitations and restrictions could arise if we are not able to satisfy and remain in compliance with specified financial ratios management believes the most significant of such ratios is the senior secured incurrence test under the credit facilities this test measures the ratio of the senior secured debt to adjusted ebitda this ratio would need to be no greater than 425 to 1 to avoid such limitations and restrictions as of january 28 2011 this ratio was 10 to 1 senior secured debt is defined as our total debt secured by liens or similar encumbrances less cash and cash equivalents ebitda is defined as income loss from continuing operations before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle plus interest and other financing costs net provision for income taxes and depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda is defined as ebitda further adjusted to give effect to adjustments required in calculating this covenant ratio under our credit facilities ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not presentations made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “us gaap” are not measures of financial performance or condition liquidity or profitability and should not be considered as an alternative to i net income operating income or any other performance measures determined in accordance with us gaap or ii operating cash flows determined in accordance with us gaap additionally ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not intended to be measures of free cash flow for management’s discretionary use as they do not consider certain cash requirements such as interest payments tax payments and debt service requirements and replacements of fixed assets

our presentation of ebitda and adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under us gaap because not all companies use identical calculations these presentations of ebitda and adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies we believe that the presentation of ebitda and adjusted ebitda is appropriate to provide additional information about the calculation of this financial ratio in the credit facilities adjusted ebitda is a material component of this ratio specifically noncompliance with the senior secured indebtedness ratio contained in our credit facilities could prohibit us subject to specified exceptions from making investments incurring liens making certain restricted payments and incurring additional secured indebtedness other than the additional funding provided for under the senior secured credit agreement

the calculation of adjusted ebitda under the credit facilities is as follows

 

interest rate swaps 

we use interest rate swaps to minimize the risk of adverse changes in interest rates these swaps are intended to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure because of high correlation between the derivative financial instrument and the underlying exposure being hedged fluctuations in the value of the financial instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying economic exposure our principal interest rate exposure relates to outstanding amounts under our credit facilities at january 28 2011 we had interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of approximately 105 billion for more information see item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” below

fair value accounting 

we have classified our interest rate swaps as further discussed in item 7a below in level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as the significant inputs to the overall valuations are based on marketobservable data or information derived from or corroborated by marketobservable data including marketbased inputs to models model calibration to marketclearing transactions broker or dealer quotations or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency where models are used the selection of a particular model to value a derivative depends upon the contractual terms of and specific risks inherent in the instrument as well as the availability of pricing information in the market we use similar models to value similar instruments valuation models require a variety of inputs including contractual terms market prices yield curves credit curves measures of volatility and correlations of such inputs for our 

derivatives all of which trade in liquid markets model inputs can generally be verified and model selection does not involve significant management judgment

we incorporate credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty’s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements of our derivatives the credit valuation adjustments are calculated by determining the total expected exposure of the derivatives which incorporates both the current and potential future exposure and then applying each counterparty’s credit spread to the applicable exposure for derivatives with twoway exposure such as interest rate swaps the counterparty’s credit spread is applied to our exposure to the counterparty and our own credit spread is applied to the counterparty’s exposure to us and the net credit valuation adjustment is reflected in our derivative valuations the total expected exposure of a derivative is derived using marketobservable inputs such as yield curves and volatilities the inputs utilized for our own credit spread are based on implied spreads from our publiclytraded debt for counterparties with publicly available credit information the credit spreads over libor used in the calculations represent implied credit default swap spreads obtained from a third party credit data provider in adjusting the fair value of our derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk we have considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements such as collateral postings thresholds mutual puts and guarantees additionally we actively monitor counterparty credit ratings for any significant changes

as of january 28 2011 the net credit valuation adjustments reduced the settlement values of our derivative liabilities by 07 million various factors impact changes in the credit valuation adjustments over time including changes in the credit spreads of the parties to the contracts as well as changes in market rates and volatilities which affect the total expected exposure of the derivative instruments when appropriate valuations are also adjusted for various factors such as liquidity and bidoffer spreads which factors we deemed to be immaterial as of january 28 2011

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of january 28 2011 in thousands

 

 

a

represents obligations for interest payments on longterm debt and capital lease obligations and includes projected interest on variable rate longterm debt using 2010 year end rates

b

we retain a significant portion of the risk for our workers’ compensation employee health insurance general liability property loss and automobile insurance as these obligations do not have scheduled maturities these amounts represent undiscounted estimates based upon actuarial assumptions reserves for workers’ compensation and general liability which existed as of the date of our 2007 merger were discounted in order to arrive at estimated fair value all other amounts are reflected on an undiscounted basis in our consolidated balance sheets

c

operating lease obligations are inclusive of amounts included in deferred rent and closed store obligations in our consolidated balance sheets

d

commercial commitments include information technology license and support agreements supplies fixtures letters of credit for import merchandise and other inventory purchase obligations

e

purchase obligations include legally binding agreements for software licenses and support supplies fixtures and merchandise purchases excluding such purchases subject to letters of credit

f

we have potential payment obligations associated with uncertain tax positions that are not reflected in these totals we anticipate that approximately 02 million of such amounts will be paid in the coming year we are currently unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the taxing authorities for our remaining 273 million of reserves for uncertain tax positions

other considerations 

we have no current plans to pay any cash dividends on our common stock and instead may retain earnings if any for future operation and expansion and debt repayment any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our board of directors subject to certain limitations found in covenants in our credit facilities and in the indentures governing the notes as discussed in more detail above and will depend on among other things our results of operations cash requirements financial condition contractual restrictions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant

our inventory balance represented approximately 45 of our total assets exclusive of goodwill and other intangible assets as of january 28 2011 our proficiency in managing our inventory balances can have a significant impact on our cash flows from operations during a given fiscal year as a result efficient inventory management has been and continues to be an area of focus for us

as described in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements we are involved in a number of legal actions and claims some of which could potentially result in material cash payments adverse developments in those actions could materially and adversely affect our liquidity as discussed in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements we also have certain income taxrelated contingencies future negative developments could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity

in june 2010 standard  poor’s upgraded our longterm debt rating to bb from bb with a stable outlook and in november 2010 moody’s upgraded our longterm debt rating to ba3 from b1 with a positive outlook these current ratings are considered noninvestment grade our current credit ratings as well as future rating agency actions could i impact our ability to obtain financings to finance our operations on satisfactory terms ii affect our financing costs and iii affect our insurance premiums and collateral requirements necessary for our selfinsured programs

cash flows 

cash flows from operating activities 

a significant component of our increase in cash flows from operating activities in 2010 compared to 2009 was the increase in net income due to greater sales higher gross margins and lower sga expenses as a percentage of sales as described in more detail above under “results of operations” partially offsetting this increase in cash flows were changes in inventory balances which increased by 16 in 2010 compared to an increase of 7 in 2009 although we continue to closely monitor our inventory balances they often fluctuate from period to period and from year to year based on new store openings the timing of purchases merchandising initiatives and other factors inventory levels in the consumables category increased by 1339 million or 16 in 2010 compared to an increase of 1114 million or 15 in 2009 the seasonal category increased by 552 million or 18 in 2010 compared to an increase of 253 million or 9 in 2009 the home products category increased 252 million or 17 in 2010 compared to a decline of 91 million or 6 in 2009 the apparel category increased by 323 million or 15 in 2010 compared to a decline of 229 million or 10 in 2009 in addition increased net income resulted in an increase in income taxes paid in 2010 compared to 2009 changes in accrued expenses and other were affected in part by reductions of income tax reserves and reduced accruals for incentive compensation partially offset by the timing of payments related to a litigation settlement in prior years as discussed in more detail below and by lower accruals for interest on longterm debt

our increase in cash flows from operating activities in 2009 compared to 2008 was also driven by an increase in net income due to greater sales higher gross margins and lower sga expenses as a percentage of sales in addition we experienced increased inventory turns in 2009 as compared to 2008 changes in inventory balances increased by 7 in 2009 compared to an increase of 10 in 2008 inventory levels in the consumables category increased by 1114 

million or 15 in 2009 compared to an increase of 778 million or 12 in 2008 the seasonal category increased by 253 million or 9 in 2009 compared to an increase of 209 million or 8 in 2008 the home products category declined 91 million or 6 in 2009 compared to a decline of 26 million or 2 in 2008 the apparel category declined by 229 million or 10 in 2009 compared to an increase of 302 million or 15 in 2008 in addition increased net income in 2009 compared to 2008 was a principal factor in the increase in income taxes paid in 2009 compared to 2008 changes in accrued expenses and other were affected in part by the timing of the payments related to the litigation settlement and related costs discussed above under “results of operations” as the associated insurance proceeds of 100 million were received at the end of 2008 while the payment of the 400 million settlement occurred at the beginning of 2009

cash flows from investing activities  cash flows used in investing activities totaling 4189 million in 2010 were primarily related to capital expenditures significant components of our property and equipment purchases in 2010 included the following approximate amounts 156 million for improvements upgrades remodels and relocations of existing stores 100 million for new leased stores 91 million for stores purchased or built by us 45 million for distribution and transportationrelated capital expenditures and 22 million for information systems upgrades and technologyrelated projects during 2010 we opened 600 new stores and remodeled or relocated 504 stores

cash flows used in investing activities totaling 2480 million in 2009 were also primarily related to capital expenditures significant components of our property and equipment purchases in 2009 included the following approximate amounts 114 million for improvements upgrades remodels and relocations of existing stores 69 million for new leased stores 28 million for distribution and transportationrelated capital expenditures 24 million for various administrative capital costs and 11 million for information systems upgrades and technologyrelated projects during 2009 we opened 500 new stores and remodeled or relocated 450 stores

cash flows used in investing activities totaling 1526 million in 2008 were primarily related to capital expenditures offset by sales of investments significant components of our property and equipment purchases in 2008 included the following approximate amounts 149 million for improvements upgrades remodels and relocations of existing stores 22 million for new leased stores 17 million for distribution and transportationrelated capital expenditures and 13 million for information systems upgrades and technologyrelated projects during 2008 we opened 207 new stores and remodeled or relocated 404 stores

purchases and sales of shortterm investments equal to net sales of 516 million in 2008 primarily reflected investment activities in our captive insurance subsidiary

capital expenditures during 2011 are projected to be in the range of 550600 million we anticipate funding 2011 capital requirements with cash flows from operations and if necessary we also have significant availability under our abl facility significant components of the 2011 capital plan include growth initiatives such as approximately 625 new stores including the purchase of existing stores and the construction of new stores costs related to new leased stores including leasehold improvements fixtures and equipment continued investment in our existing store base with plans for remodeling and relocating approximately 550 stores the 

construction of a new distribution center in alabama as well as additional investments in our supply chain and information technology we plan to undertake these expenditures as part of our efforts to improve our infrastructure and increase our cash generated from operating activities

cash flows from financing activities  during 2010 we repurchased 1150 million outstanding principal amount of our outstanding senior notes at a total cost of 1275 million including associated premiums we had no borrowings or repayments under the abl facility in 2010

in 2009 we had cash inflows from the issuance of equity of 4438 million primarily due to our initial public offering of 227 million shares of common stock we used the proceeds from the offering to redeem outstanding notes with a total principal amount of 4009 million at a premium and used cash generated from operations to repay 3365 million outstanding principal amount on our term loan facility we had no borrowings or repayments under the abl facility in 2009 in addition we paid a dividend and related amounts totaling 2397 million using cash generated from operations

in february 2008 we repaid outstanding borrowings of 1025 million under our abl facility and have had no borrowings outstanding under the abl facility since that time also during 2008 we repurchased 441 million principal amount of our outstanding senior subordinated notes

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures in addition to the estimates presented below there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed critical as defined below we believe these estimates are reasonable and appropriate however if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used the resulting changes could have a material effect on the financial statements taken as a whole

management believes the following policies and estimates are critical because they involve significant judgments assumptions and estimates management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosures presented below relating to those policies and estimates

merchandise inventories  merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined using the retail lastin firstout “lifo” method under our retail inventory method “rim” the calculation of gross profit and the resulting valuation of inventories at cost are computed by applying a calculated costtoretail inventory ratio to the retail value of sales at a department level the rim is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality also it is recognized that the use of the rim will result in valuing inventories at the lower of cost or market “lcm” if markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories

inherent in the rim calculation are certain significant management judgments and estimates including among others initial markups markdowns and shrinkage which significantly impact the gross profit calculation as well as the ending inventory valuation at cost these significant estimates coupled with the fact that the rim is an averaging process can under certain circumstances produce distorted cost figures factors that can lead to distortion in the calculation of the inventory balance include

·

applying the rim to a group of products that is not fairly uniform in terms of its cost and selling price relationship and turnover

·

applying the rim to transactions over a period of time that include different rates of gross profit such as those relating to seasonal merchandise

·

inaccurate estimates of inventory shrinkage between the date of the last physical inventory at a store and the financial statement date and

·

inaccurate estimates of lcm andor lifo reserves

factors that reduce potential distortion include the use of historical experience in estimating the shrink provision see discussion below and an annual lifo analysis whereby all skus are considered in the index formulation an actual valuation of inventory under the lifo method is made at the end of each year based on the inventory levels and costs at that time accordingly interim lifo calculations are based on management’s estimates of expected yearend inventory levels sales for the year and the expected rate of inflationdeflation for the year and are thus subject to adjustment in the final yearend lifo inventory valuation we also perform interim inventory analysis for determining obsolete inventory our policy is to write down inventory to an lcm value based on various management assumptions including estimated markdowns and sales required to liquidate such inventory in future periods inventory is reviewed on a quarterly basis and adjusted as appropriate to reflect writedowns determined to be necessary

factors such as slower inventory turnover due to changes in competitors’ practices consumer preferences consumer spending and unseasonable weather patterns among other factors could cause excess inventory requiring greater than estimated markdowns to entice consumer purchases resulting in an unfavorable impact on our consolidated financial statements sales shortfalls due to the above factors could cause reduced purchases from vendors and associated vendor allowances that would also result in an unfavorable impact on our consolidated financial statements 

we calculate our shrink provision based on actual physical inventory results during the fiscal period and an accrual for estimated shrink occurring subsequent to a physical inventory through the end of the fiscal reporting period this accrual is calculated as a percentage of sales at each retail store at a department level and is determined by dividing the booktophysical inventory adjustments recorded during the previous twelve months by the related sales for the same period for each store to the extent that subsequent physical inventories yield different results than this estimated accrual our effective shrink rate for a given reporting period will 

include the impact of adjusting the estimated results to the actual results although we perform physical inventories in virtually all of our stores on an annual basis the same stores do not necessarily get counted in the same reporting periods from year to year which could impact comparability in a given reporting period

we believe our estimates and assumptions related to merchandise inventories have generally been accurate in recent years and we do not currently anticipate material changes in these estimates and assumptions

goodwill and other intangible assets we amortize intangible assets over their estimated useful lives unless such lives are deemed indefinite if impairment indicators are noted amortizable intangible assets are tested for impairment based on projected undiscounted cash flows and if impaired written down to fair value based on either discounted projected cash flows or appraised values future cash flow projections are based on management’s projections significant judgments required in this testing process may include projecting future cash flows determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions projections are based on management’s best estimates given recent financial performance market trends strategic plans and other available information which in recent years have been materially accurate although not currently anticipated changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value or impairment future indicators of impairment could result in an asset impairment charge

under accounting standards for goodwill and other intangible assets we are required to test such assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators occur the goodwill impairment test is a twostep process that requires management to make judgments in determining what assumptions to use in the calculation the first step of the process consists of estimating the fair value of our reporting unit based on valuation techniques including a discounted cash flow model using revenue and profit forecasts and comparing that estimated fair value with the recorded carrying value which includes goodwill if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment by determining an “implied fair value” of goodwill the determination of the implied fair value of goodwill would require us to allocate the estimated fair value of our reporting unit to its assets and liabilities any unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill which would be compared to its corresponding carrying value 

the impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount if the carrying amount of an indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess

we performed our annual impairment tests of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets during the third quarter of 2010 based on conditions as of the end of the second quarter of 2010 the tests indicated that no impairment charge was necessary we are not currently projecting a decline in cash flows that could be expected to have an adverse effect such as a violation of debt covenants or future impairment charges

property and equipment  property and equipment are recorded at cost we group our assets into relatively homogeneous classes and generally provide for depreciation on a straightline basis over the estimated average useful life of each asset class except for leasehold improvements which are amortized over the lesser of the applicable lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset certain store and warehouse fixtures when fully depreciated are removed from the cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization accounts the valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of depreciable lives involves significant judgments and the use of estimates which we believe have been materially accurate in recent years

impairment of longlived assets we review the carrying value of all longlived assets for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with accounting standards for impairment or disposal of longlived assets we review for impairment stores open for approximately two years or more for which recent cash flows from operations are negative impairment results when the carrying value of the assets exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the life of the lease our estimate of undiscounted future cash flows over the lease term is based upon historical operations of the stores and estimates of future store profitability which encompasses many factors that are subject to variability and are difficult to predict if a longlived asset is found to be impaired the amount recognized for impairment is equal to the difference between the carrying value and the asset’s estimated fair value the fair value is estimated based primarily upon projected future cash flows discounted at our credit adjusted riskfree rate or other reasonable estimates of fair market value in accordance with us gaap during 2010 2009 and 2008 we recorded pretax impairment charges of 17 million 50 million and 40 million respectively for certain store assets that we deemed to be impaired

insurance liabilities  we retain a significant portion of the risk for our workers’ compensation employee health property loss automobile and general liability these represent significant costs primarily due to the large employee base and number of stores provisions are made to these liabilities on an undiscounted basis based on actual claim data and estimates of incurred but not reported claims developed using actuarial methodologies based on historical claim trends which have been and are anticipated to continue to be materially accurate if future claim trends deviate from recent historical patterns we may be required to record additional expenses or expense reductions which could be material to our future financial results

contingent liabilities – income taxes income tax reserves are determined using the methodology established by accounting standards relating to uncertainty in income taxes these standards require companies to assess each income tax position taken using a two step process a determination is first made as to whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained based upon the technical merits upon examination by the taxing authorities if the tax position is expected to meet the more likely than not criteria the benefit recorded for the tax position equals the largest amount that is greater than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement of the respective tax position uncertain tax positions require determinations and estimated liabilities to be made based on provisions of the tax law which may be subject to 

change or varying interpretation if our determinations and estimates prove to be inaccurate the resulting adjustments could be material to our future financial results

contingent liabilities  legal matters  we are subject to legal regulatory and other proceedings and claims we establish liabilities as appropriate for these claims and proceedings based upon the probability and estimability of losses and to fairly present in conjunction with the disclosures of these matters in our financial statements and sec filings management’s view of our exposure we review outstanding claims and proceedings with external counsel to assess probability and estimates of loss we reevaluate these assessments on a quarterly basis or as new and significant information becomes available to determine whether a liability should be established or if any existing liability should be adjusted the actual cost of resolving a claim or proceeding ultimately may be substantially different than the amount of the recorded liability in addition because it is not permissible under us gaap to establish a litigation liability until the loss is both probable and estimable in some cases there may be insufficient time to establish a liability prior to the actual incurrence of the loss upon verdict and judgment at trial for example or in the case of a quickly negotiated settlement

lease accounting and excess facilities  many of our stores are subject to buildtosuit arrangements with landlords which typically carry a primary lease term of 1015 years with multiple renewal options we also have stores subject to shorterterm leases usually with initial or current terms of 3 to 5 years and many of these leases have multiple renewal options as of january 28 2011 approximately 35 of our stores had provisions for contingent rentals based upon a percentage of defined sales volume we recognize contingent rental expense when the achievement of specified sales targets is considered probable we recognize rent expense over the term of the lease we record minimum rental expense on a straightline basis over the base noncancelable lease term commencing on the date that we take physical possession of the property from the landlord which normally includes a period prior to store opening to make necessary leasehold improvements and install store fixtures when a lease contains a predetermined fixed escalation of the minimum rent we recognize the related rent expense on a straightline basis and record the difference between the recognized rental expense and the amounts payable under the lease as deferred rent tenant allowances to the extent received are recorded as deferred incentive rent and amortized as a reduction to rent expense over the term of the lease we reflect as a liability any difference between the calculated expense and the amounts actually paid improvements of leased properties are amortized over the shorter of the life of the applicable lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset 

for store closures excluding those associated with a business combination where a lease obligation still exists we record the estimated future liability associated with the rental obligation on the date the store is closed in accordance with accounting standards for costs associated with exit or disposal activities based on an overall analysis of store performance and expected trends management periodically evaluates the need to close underperforming stores liabilities are established at the point of closure for the present value of any remaining operating lease obligations net of estimated sublease income and at the communication date for severance and other exit costs key assumptions in calculating the liability include the timeframe expected to terminate lease agreements estimates related to the sublease potential of closed locations and estimation of other related exit costs historically these estimates have not been materially inaccurate however if actual timing and potential termination costs or realization of sublease 

income differ from our estimates the resulting liabilities could vary from recorded amounts these liabilities are reviewed periodically and adjusted when necessary 

sharebased payments  our sharebased stock option awards are valued on an individual grant basis using the blackscholesmerton closed form option pricing model we believe that this model fairly estimates the value of our sharebased awards the application of this valuation model involves assumptions that are judgmental and highly sensitive in the valuation of stock options which affects compensation expense related to these options these assumptions include an estimate of the fair value of our common stock the term that the options are expected to be outstanding an estimate of the volatility of our stock price which is based on a peer group of publicly traded companies applicable interest rates and the dividend yield of our stock our volatility estimates are based on a peer group due to the fact that our stock has been publicly traded for a relatively short period of time in relation to the expected term of outstanding options other factors involving judgments that affect the expensing of sharebased payments include estimated forfeiture rates of sharebased awards historically these estimates have not been materially inaccurate however if our estimates differ materially from actual experience we may be required to record additional expense or reductions of expense which could be material to our future financial results

fair value measurements we measure fair value of assets and liabilities in accordance with applicable accounting standards which require that fair values be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability these standards establish a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity observable inputs that are classified within levels 1 and 2 of the hierarchy and the reporting entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions unobservable inputs classified within level 3 of the hierarchy therefore level 3 inputs are typically based on an entity’s own assumptions as there is little if any related market activity and thus require the use of significant judgment and estimates currently we have no assets or liabilities that are valued based solely on level 3 inputs

our fair value measurements are primarily associated with our derivative financial instruments intangible assets property and equipment and to a lesser degree our investments the values of our derivative financial instruments are determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative this analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives including the period to maturity and uses observable marketbased inputs including interest rate curves the fair values of interest rate swaps are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash payments or receipts and the discounted expected variable cash receipts or payments the variable cash receipts or payments are based on an expectation of future interest rates forward curves derived from observable market interest rate curves in recent years these methodologies have produced materially accurate valuations

derivative financial instruments we account for our derivative instruments in accordance with accounting standards for derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and hedging activities as amended and interpreted 

which establish accounting and reporting requirements for such instruments and activities these standards require that every derivative instrument be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value and that changes in the derivative’s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met see “fair value measurements” above for a discussion of derivative valuations special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative’s gains and losses to either offset related results on the hedged item in the statement of operations or be accumulated in other comprehensive income and requires that a company formally document designate and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting we use derivative instruments to manage our exposure to changing interest rates primarily with interest rate swaps 

in addition to making valuation estimates we also bear the risk that certain derivative instruments that have been designated as hedges and currently meet the strict hedge accounting requirements may not qualify in the future as “highly effective” as defined as well as the risk that hedged transactions in cash flow hedging relationships may no longer be considered probable to occur further new interpretations and guidance related to these instruments may be issued in the future and we cannot predict the possible impact that such guidance may have on our use of derivative instruments going forward




 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

financial risk management 

we are exposed to market risk primarily from adverse changes in interest rates and to a lesser degree commodity prices to minimize this risk we may periodically use financial instruments including derivatives as a matter of policy we do not buy or sell financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes and all derivative financial instrument transactions must be authorized and executed pursuant to approval by the board of directors all financial instrument positions taken by us are intended to be used to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure because of high correlation between the derivative financial instrument and the underlying exposure being hedged fluctuations in the value of the financial instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying economic exposure

interest rate risk 

we manage our interest rate risk through the strategic use of fixed and variable interest rate debt and from time to time derivative financial instruments our principal interest rate exposure relates to outstanding amounts under our credit facilities as of january 28 2011 our credit facilities provide for variable rate borrowings of up to 2995 billion including availability of up to 1031 billion under our abl facility subject to the borrowing base in order to mitigate a portion of the variable rate interest exposure under the credit facilities we entered into certain interest rate swaps which became effective on july 31 2007 pursuant to these swaps we swapped three month libor rates for fixed interest rates resulting in the payment of an allin fixed rate of 768 on an original notional amount of 20 billion originally scheduled to amortize on a quarterly basis until maturity at july 31 2012

in october 2008 a counterparty to one of our 2007 swap agreements defaulted we terminated this agreement and in november 2008 we subsequently cash settled the swap representatives of the counterparty have challenged our calculation of the cash settlement see “legal proceedings” under note 9 of the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements as of january 28 2011 the notional amount under the remaining 2007 swaps is 6467 million

 

effective december 31 2008 we entered into a 4750 million interest rate swap in order to mitigate an additional portion of the variable rate interest exposure under the credit facilities this swap is scheduled to mature on january 31 2013 under the terms of this agreement we swapped one month libor rates for fixed interest rates resulting in the payment of a fixed rate of 506 on a notional amount of 4750 million through april 2010 4000 million from may 2010 through october 2011 and 3000 million to maturity

a change in interest rates on variable rate debt impacts our pretax earnings and cash flows whereas a change in interest rates on fixed rate debt impacts the economic fair value of debt but not our pretax earnings and cash flows our interest rate swaps qualify for hedge accounting as cash flow hedges therefore changes in market fluctuations related to the 

effective portion of these cash flow hedges do not impact our pretax earnings until the accrued interest is recognized on the derivatives and the associated hedged debt based on our variable rate borrowing levels and interest rate swaps outstanding during 2010 and 2009 the annualized effect of a one percentage point change in variable interest rates would have resulted in a pretax reduction of our earnings and cash flows of approximately 93 million in 2010 and 56 million in 2009

the conditions and uncertainties in the global credit markets have increased the credit risk of other counterparties to our swap agreements in the event such counterparties fail to perform under our swap agreements and we are unable to enter into new swap agreements on terms favorable to us our ability to effectively manage our interest rate risk may be materially impaired we attempt to manage counterparty credit risk by periodically evaluating the financial position and creditworthiness of such counterparties monitoring the amount for which we are at risk with each counterparty and where possible dispersing the risk among multiple counterparties there can be no assurance that we will manage or mitigate our counterparty credit risk effectively

we have audited dollar general corporation and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of january 28 2011 based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the coso criteria dollar general corporation and subsidiaries’ management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate

in our opinion dollar general corporation and subsidiaries maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of january 28 2011 based on the coso criteria  

we also have audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of dollar general corporation and subsidiaries as of january 28 2011 and january 29 2010 and the related consolidated statements of income shareholders equity and cash flows for the years ended january 28 2011 january 29 2010 and january 30 2009 of dollar general corporation and subsidiaries and our report dated march 22 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon

general 

we are the largest discount retailer in the united states by number of stores with 8414 stores located in 35 states primarily in the southern southwestern midwestern and eastern united states as of february 27 2009 we serve a broad customer base and offer a focused assortment of everyday items including basic consumable merchandise and other home apparel and seasonal products a majority of our products are priced at 10 or less and approximately 25 of our products are priced at 1 or less 

we offer a compelling value proposition for our customers based on convenient store locations easy in and out shopping and quality name brand and private brand merchandise at highly competitive everyday low prices we believe our combination of value and convenience distinguishes us from other discount convenience and drugstore retailers who typically focus on either value or convenience our business model is focused on strong and sustainable sales growth attractive margins and limited maintenance capital expenditure and working capital needs which in combination result in significant cash flow from operations before interest

we were founded in 1939 as jl turner and son wholesale we opened our first dollar store in 1955 when we were incorporated as a kentucky corporation under the name jl turner  son inc we changed our name to dollar general corporation in 1968 and reincorporated as a tennessee corporation in 1998 in 2007 we entered into a merger transaction with an entity controlled by investment funds affiliated with kohlberg kravis roberts  co lp “kkr” or “sponsor” as discussed in more detail under “our 2007 merger” below

we have increased our total number of stores from 6700 on january 30 2004 to 8362 on january 30 2009 a 45 compounded annual growth rate “cagr” over the same period we grew our net sales from 69 billion to 105 billion 88 cagr driven by growth in number of stores as well as same store sales growth we slowed new store growth in 2007 and 2008 and closed approximately 400 stores in 2007 to improve our profitability and to enable us to focus on improving the performance of existing stores in 2008 we opened 207 new stores closed 39 stores and relocated or remodeled 404 existing stores net sales in 2008 were driven primarily by a samestore sales increase of 90 see our consolidated financial statements for net sales and net income loss for each of our last three fiscal years and total assets for each of our last two fiscal years we intend to accelerate our new store growth in 2009 with plans to open approximately 450 new stores and to remodel or relocate approximately 400 stores

our 2007 merger 

on july 6 2007 we completed a merger the “merger” and as a result we are a subsidiary of buck holdings lp “parent” a delaware limited partnership controlled by investment funds affiliated with kkr kkr gs capital partners vi fund lp and affiliated funds affiliates of goldman sachs  co citi private equity wellington management 

company llp cpp investment board usre ii inc and other equity coinvestors collectively the “investors” indirectly own a substantial portion of our capital stock through their investment in parent

as a result of the merger our outstanding common stock is now owned by parent and certain members of management our common stock is not registered with the securities and exchange commission “sec” and is not traded on a national securities exchange 

we entered into the following debt financings in conjunction with the merger 

·

we entered into a credit agreement and related security and other agreements consisting of a 23 billion senior secured term loan facility which matures on july 6 2014 the “term loan facility” 

·

accounting periods before and after the merger are referred to as the predecessor and successor respectively

overall business strategy 

our mission is “serving others” to carry out this mission we have developed a business strategy of providing our customers with a focused assortment of everyday low priced merchandise in a convenient smallstore format

our customers  in general we locate our stores and base our merchandise selection on the needs of households seeking value and convenience with an emphasis on rural and small markets however much of our merchandise intended to serve the basic consumable household apparel and seasonal needs of these targeted customers also appeals to a much broader and higher income customer base 

our stores  the traditional dollar general® store has on average approximately 7000 square feet of selling space and generally serves customers who live within three miles of the store of our 8414 stores operating as of february 27 2009 more than 60 serve communities 

with populations of 20000 or less we believe that our target customers prefer the convenience of a small neighborhood store with a focused merchandise assortment at value prices

our merchandise  our merchandising strategy combines a lowcost operating structure with a focused assortment of products consisting of quality basic consumable household apparel and seasonal merchandise at competitive everyday low prices our strategic combination of name brands quality private brand products and other great value brands allows us to offer our customers a compelling value proposition we believe our merchandising strategy and focused assortment generate frequent repeat customer purchases and encourage customers to shop at our stores for their everyday household needs 

our prices we distribute quality consumable merchandise at everyday low prices our strategy of maintaining a lowcost operating structure and a focused assortment of merchandise allows us to offer quality merchandise at competitive prices as part of this strategy we emphasize evendollar prices on many of our items in the typical dollar general store the majority of the products are priced at 10 or less with approximately 25 of the products priced at 1 or less 

our cost controls  we aggressively manage our overhead cost structure and generally seek to locate stores in neighborhoods where rental and operating costs are relatively low our stores typically have low fixed costs including lean staffing in recent years we implemented “ezstore tm ” our proprietary process designed to improve inventory flow from our distribution centers or dcs to consumers the ezstore process has allowed us to reallocate store labor hours to more customerfocused activities improving the work content in our stores 

we also attempt to control operating costs by implementing new technology when feasible in recent years we have improved our store labor scheduling store replenishment and our supply chain and warehousing systems we are in the process of expanding our technological capabilities by installing store computers throughout the chain this initiative is expected to improve store communications and execution and reduce costs

strategic initiatives — project alpha in 2007 we executed strategic initiatives launched in the fourth quarter of 2006 aimed at improving our merchandising and real estate strategies which we refer to collectively as “project alpha” project alpha was based upon a comprehensive analysis of the performance of each of our stores and the impact of our inventory management model on our ability to effectively serve our customers 

the execution of this merchandising initiative has moved us away from our traditional inventory packaway model where unsold seasonal apparel and home products inventory items were stored onsite and returned to the sales floor until the items were eventually sold damaged or discarded in connection with this initiative in fiscal 2007 we began taking endofseason markdowns on currentyear nonreplenishable merchandise with limited and planned exceptions we eliminated through endofseason and other markdowns our seasonal home products and basic clothing packaway merchandise and out of season current year merchandise by the end of fiscal 2007 in addition to allowing us to carry newer fresher merchandise particularly in our seasonal apparel and home categories we believe this strategy change has 

enhanced the appearance of our stores and has positively impacted customer satisfaction as well as our store employees’ ability to manage stores

project alpha also encompassed significant improvements to our real estate practices we have integrated the functions of site selection lease renewals relocations remodels and store closings and have defined and are implementing rigorous analytical processes for decisionmaking in those areas as a first step in our initiative to revitalize our store base we performed a comprehensive real estate review resulting in the identification of approximately 400 underperforming stores all of which we closed by mid2007 these closings were in addition to stores that are typically closed in the normal course of business which over the last 10 years constituted approximately 1 to 2 of our store base per year in 2008 our store closings were more in line with historic levels as we closed 39 stores as part of project alpha we moderated our new store growth rate beginning in 2007 to enable us to focus on improving the performance of existing stores including increasing the number of store remodels and relocations in order to improve productivity and enhance the shopping experience for our customers we intend to accelerate our new store growth in 2009 by opening approximately 450 new stores and remodeling or relocating approximately 400 stores

as a result of opening new stores and remodeling existing stores as of february 27 2009 approximately 1600 stores are operating in our racetrack format which is designed with improved merchandise adjacencies and wider more open aisles to enhance the overall guest shopping experience we plan to continue to review and refine all of our existing store layouts including the racetrack format as well as test new layouts to further drive sales growth and margin enhancements through improved merchandising

our industry 

we compete in the deep discount segment of the us retail industry our competitors include traditional “dollar stores” as well as other retailers offering discounted convenience items the “dollar store” sector differentiates itself from other forms of retailing in the deep discount segment by offering consistently low prices in a convenient smallstore format unlike other formats that have suffered with the rise of walmart and other discount supercenters the “dollar store” sector has grown despite the presence of the discount supercenters we believe it is our substantial convenience advantage at prices comparable to those of supercenters that allows dollar general to compete so effectively

 

we believe that there is considerable room for growth in the “dollar store” sector according to data from nielsen homescan panel “nielsen” “dollar stores” have been able to increase their penetration across all income brackets in recent years climbing from 45 in 1997 to 64 in 2008 though traditional “dollar stores” have high customer penetration according to nielsen the sector as a whole accounts for only approximately 15 of retail spending which we believe leaves ample room for growth our merchandising initiatives are aimed at increasing our stores’ share of customer spending

see “our competitive strengths” and “competition” below for additional information regarding our competitive situation

our competitive strengths 

market leader in an attractive sector with a growing customer base we are the largest discount retailer in the us by number of stores with 8414 stores in 35 states as of february 27 2009 we are the largest player in the us small box deep discount segment based on sales we believe we are well positioned to further increase our market share as we continue to execute our business strategy and implement our operational initiatives our target customers are those seeking value and convenience according to nielsen recent trip consolidation has caused decreased total outlet trips per shopper by approximately 25 at the same time the “dollar store” channel grew trips per shopper by approximately 25 faster than any other retail channel and the only channel other than warehouse clubs that increased trips per shopper 

consistent sales growth and strong cash flow generation for 19 consecutive years we have experienced positive annual same store sales growth approximately twothirds of our net sales come from the sale of consumable products which are less susceptible to economic pressures such as increased fuel costs and unemployment with the remaining onethird comprised mainly of seasonal basic clothing and home products which are subject to little trend or fashion risk we have a low cost operating model with attractive operating margins low capital expenditures and low working capital needs resulting in generation of significant cash flow from operations before interest

differentiated value proposition our ability to deliver highly competitive everyday low prices in a convenient location and shopping format provides our customers with a compelling shopping experience and distinguishes us from other discount retailers as well as from convenience and drugstore retailers 

compelling unit economics the traditional dollar general store size design and location requires an initial investment for fixtures equipment signage and inventory of approximately 230000 the low initial investment and maintenance capital expenditures when combined with strong average unit volumes provide for a quick recovery of store startup costs the ability of our successful stores to generate strong cash flows with minimal investment often results in a short payback period 

efficient supply chain we believe our distribution network is an integral component of our efforts to reduce transportation expenses and effectively support our growth in recent years we have made significant investments in technological improvements and upgrades which have increased our efficiency and capacity to support our merchandising and operations initiatives and new store growth

experienced management team in january 2008 we hired richard dreiling who has 39 years of retail experience to serve as our chief executive officer over the past several years we strengthened our management team with the hiring of david beré our president and chief strategy officer and todd vasos our executive vice president division president and chief merchandising officer we also replaced a majority of our senior merchandising and real estate teams

seasonality 

our business is seasonal to a certain extent generally our highest sales volume occurs in the fourth quarter which includes the christmas selling season and the lowest occurs in the first quarter in addition our quarterly results can be affected by the timing of new store openings and store closings the amount of sales contributed by new and existing stores as well as the timing of certain holidays we purchase substantial amounts of inventory in the third quarter and incur higher shipping costs and higher payroll costs in anticipation of the increased sales activity during the fourth quarter in addition we carry merchandise during our fourth quarter that we do not carry during the rest of the year such as gift sets holiday decorations certain baking items and a broader assortment of toys and candy

the following table reflects the seasonality of net sales gross profit and net income loss by quarter for each of the quarters of the current fiscal year as well as each of the quarters of the two most recent fiscal years all of the quarters reflected below are comprised of 13 weeks see note a regarding results for the second quarter of 2007

 

a

the merger was completed during the second quarter of 2007 net sales gross profit and net loss were 16485 4385 and 429 respectively for the predecessor period from may 5 2007 to july 6 2007 and were 6991 1847 and 272 respectively for the successor period from march 6 2007 to august 3 2007 for comparison purposes these successor results include the results of operations for buck acquisition corp for the period prior to the merger from march 6 2007 its formation through july 6 2007 reflecting the change in fair value of interest rate swaps

b

results for the 3 rd and 4 th quarters of 2006 and all of 2007 reflect the impact of certain strategic real estate and inventory management initiatives as discussed above in “overall business strategy”

merchandise 

we separate our merchandise into the following four categories for reporting purposes highly consumable seasonal home products and basic clothing highly consumable consists of packaged food candy snacks and refrigerated products health and beauty aids home cleaning supplies and pet supplies seasonal consists of seasonal and holidayrelated items toys stationery and hardware home products consists of housewares and domestics and basic 

clothing consists of casual everyday apparel the percentage of net sales of each of our four categories of merchandise for the period indicated below was as follows

 

our home products and seasonal categories typically account for the highest gross profit margin and the highly consumable category typically accounts for the lowest gross profit margin 

we currently maintain approximately 7300 core stockkeeping units or skus per store and an additional 3200 noncore skus that get rotated in and out of the store over the course of a year

we purchase our merchandise from a wide variety of suppliers approximately 10 of our purchases in 2008 were from the procter  gamble company our next largest supplier accounted for approximately 6 of our purchases in 2008 we directly imported approximately 10 of our purchases at cost 14 at retail in 2008

the dollar general store 

the average dollar general store has approximately 7000 square feet of selling space and is typically operated by a manager an assistant manager and two or more sales clerks approximately 53 are in freestanding buildings 45 of our stores are located in strip shopping centers and 2 are in downtown buildings we attempt to locate primarily in small towns or in neighborhoods of more densely populated areas where occupancy expenses are relatively low

we generally have not encountered difficulty locating suitable store sites in the past and although management does not currently anticipate experiencing material difficulty in finding future suitable locations the current conditions in the real estate and financing markets could make this process more difficult than in recent years

our recent store growth is summarized in the following table

 

employees 

as of february 27 2009 we employed approximately 72500 fulltime and parttime employees including divisional and regional managers district managers store managers and dc and administrative personnel management believes our relationship with our employees is generally good and we currently are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements

competition 

we operate in the discount retail merchandise business which is highly competitive with respect to price store location merchandise quality assortment and presentation instock consistency and customer service we compete with discount stores and with many other retailers including mass merchandise grocery drug convenience variety and other specialty stores these other retail companies operate stores in many of the areas where we operate and many of them engage in extensive advertising and marketing efforts our direct competitors in the dollar store retail category include family dollar dollar tree fred’s 99 cents only and various local independent operators competitors from other retail categories include walmart walgreens cvs rite aid target and costco among others certain of our competitors have greater financial distribution marketing and other resources than we do

the dollar store category differentiates itself from other forms of retailing by offering consistently low prices in a convenient smallstore format we believe that our prices are competitive due in part to our low cost operating structure and the relatively limited assortment of products offered historically we have minimized labor by offering fewer price points and a reliance on simple merchandise presentation we maintain strong purchasing power due to our leadership position in the dollar store retail category and our focused assortment of merchandise

trademarks 

we own marks that are registered with the united states patent and trademark office including the trademarks dollar general® dollar general market® clover valley® dg® dg guarantee® and the dollar general price point designs along with variations and formatives of these trademarks as well as certain other trademarks we attempt to obtain registration of our trademarks whenever practicable and to pursue vigorously any infringement of those marks our trademark registrations have various expiration dates however assuming that the trademark registrations are properly renewed they have a perpetual duration

risk factors 

investing in our securities involves a degree of risk persons buying our securities should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information contained in this report and other filings that we make from time to time with the sec including our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations in addition the risks described below are not the only risks we face our business financial condition or results of operations could also be adversely affected by additional factors that apply to all companies generally as well as other risks that are not currently known to us or that we currently view to be immaterial in any such case the trading price of our securities could decline or we may not be able to make payments of principal and interest on our outstanding notes and you may lose all or part of your original investment while we attempt to mitigate known risks to the extent we believe to be practicable and reasonable we can provide no assurance and we make no representation that our mitigation efforts will be successful

the fact that we have substantial debt could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting our obligations under our outstanding debt securities 

we have substantial debt which could have important consequences including

·

increasing difficulty in making payments on our outstanding debt

·

increasing our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions

·

requiring a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness therefore reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations capital expenditures and future business opportunities

·

exposing us to the risk of interest rate fluctuations as certain of our borrowings bear interest based on market interest rates

·

limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures debt service requirements acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes and

·

limiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less highly leveraged

in addition the borrowings under our credit facilities bear interest at variable rates and other debt we incur also could be variablerate debt if market interest rates increase variablerate debt will create higher debt service requirements which could adversely affect our cash flow while we have and may in the future enter into agreements limiting our exposure to higher interest rates any such agreements may not offer complete protection from this risk we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future subject to the restrictions contained in our credit facilities and the indentures governing our debt securities if new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels the related risks that we now face could intensify

our debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business 

our credit facilities and the indentures governing our debt securities contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions these covenants limit our and our restricted subsidiaries’ ability to among other things

·

incur additional indebtedness issue disqualified stock or issue certain preferred stock

·

pay dividends and make certain distributions investments and other restricted payments

·

create certain liens or encumbrances

·

sell assets

·

enter into transactions with our affiliates

·

limit the ability of restricted subsidiaries to make payments to us

·

merge consolidate sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets and

·

designate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries

a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the agreement governing such indebtedness upon our failure to maintain compliance with these covenants the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit thereunder if the lenders under such indebtedness accelerate the repayment of borrowings we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay those borrowings as well as our other indebtedness including our outstanding debt securities we have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral under our credit facilities if we were unable to repay those amounts the lenders under our 

credit facilities could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness additional borrowings under the abl facility will if excess availability under that facility is less than a certain amount be subject to the satisfaction of a specified financial ratio our ability to meet this financial ratio can be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot assure you that we will meet this ratio and other covenants 

general economic factors may adversely affect our financial performance and other aspects of our business 

a further slowdown in the economy or other economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as unemployment levels inflation business conditions fuel and other energy costs consumer debt levels lack of available credit interest rates tax rates and changes in tax laws may adversely affect our business by reducing overall consumer spending or by causing customers to shift their spending to products other than those sold by us or to products sold by us that are less profitable than other product choices all of which could result in lower net sales decreases in inventory turnover greater markdowns on inventory and a reduction in profitability due to lower margins many of those factors as well as commodity rates transportation costs costs of labor insurance and healthcare foreign exchange rate fluctuations lease costs changes in other laws and regulations and other economic factors also affect our cost of sales and our selling general and administrative expenses and we have no control or limited ability to control such factors  

in addition many of the factors discussed above along with current global economic conditions and uncertainties the potential impact of the current recession the potential for additional failures or realignments of financial institutions and the related impact on available credit may affect us and our suppliers and other business partners landlords and customers in an adverse manner including but not limited to reducing access to liquid funds or credit including through the loss of one or more financial institutions that are a part of our revolving credit facility increasing the cost of credit limiting our ability to manage interest rate risk increasing the risk of bankruptcy of our suppliers landlords or counterparties to or other financial institutions involved in our credit facilities and our derivative and other contracts increasing the cost of goods to us and other impacts which we are unable to fully anticipate see also our disclosures under part ii item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” below

our plans depend significantly on initiatives designed to improve the efficiencies costs and effectiveness of our operations and failure to achieve or sustain these plans could affect our performance adversely 

we have had and expect to continue to have initiatives such as those relating to marketing merchandising promotions sourcing shrink private brand store operations and real estate in various stages of testing evaluation and implementation upon which we expect to rely to improve our results of operations and financial condition these initiatives are inherently risky and uncertain even when tested successfully in their application to our business in general it is possible that successful testing can result partially from resources and attention that cannot be duplicated in broader implementation testing and general implementation also can be affected 

by other risk factors described herein that reduce the results expected successful systemwide implementation relies on consistency of training stability of workforce ease of execution and the absence of offsetting factors that can influence results adversely failure to achieve successful implementation of our initiatives or the cost of these initiatives exceeding management’s estimates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

risks associated with the domestic and foreign suppliers from whom our products are sourced could adversely affect our financial performance 

the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers approximately 10 of our purchases in 2008 were from the procter  gamble company our next largest supplier accounted for approximately 6 of our purchases in 2008 we directly imported approximately 10 of our purchases at cost in 2008 but many of our domestic vendors directly import their products or components of their products political and economic instability in the countries in which foreign suppliers are located the financial instability of suppliers suppliers’ failure to meet our supplier standards labor problems experienced by our suppliers the availability of raw materials to suppliers merchandise quality or safety issues currency exchange rates transport availability and cost inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located or from which they import are beyond our control in addition the united states’ foreign trade policies tariffs and other impositions on imported goods trade sanctions imposed on certain countries the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control disruptions due to labor stoppages strikes or slowdowns or other disruptions involving our vendors or the transportation and handling industries also may negatively affect our ability to receive merchandise and thus may negatively affect sales these and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our financial performance 

all of our vendors must comply with applicable product safety laws and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety standards our ability to obtain indemnification from foreign suppliers may be hindered by the manufacturers’ lack of understanding of us product liability or other laws which may make it more likely that we be required to respond to claims or complaints from customers as if we were the manufacturer of the products

as we increase our imports of merchandise from foreign vendors the risks associated with foreign imports will increase 

we are subject to governmental regulations procedures and requirements a significant change in or noncompliance with these regulations could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance 

our business is subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws and regulations particularly those governing the sale of products may require extensive system and operating changes that may be difficult to implement and could increase our cost of doing business in addition such changes or new laws 

may require the write off and disposal of existing product inventory resulting in significant adverse financial impact to the company untimely compliance or noncompliance with applicable regulations or untimely or incomplete execution of a required product recall can result in the imposition of penalties including loss of licenses or significant fines or monetary penalties in addition to reputational damage

litigation may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business is subject to the risk of litigation by employees consumers suppliers competitors shareholders government agencies or others through private actions class actions administrative proceedings regulatory actions or other litigation the number of employmentrelated class actions filed each year has continued to increase and recent changes in federal law may cause claims to rise even more the outcome of litigation particularly class action lawsuits regulatory actions and intellectual property claims is difficult to assess or quantify plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to these lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time in addition certain of these lawsuits if decided adversely to us or settled by us may result in liability material to our financial statements as a whole or may negatively affect our operating results if changes to our business operation are required the cost to defend future litigation may be significant there also may be adverse publicity associated with litigation that could negatively affect customer perception of our business regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable as a result litigation may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations see the disclosure under the heading “legal proceedings” in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements herein for further details regarding certain of these pending matters 

failure to attract and retain qualified employees while controlling labor costs as well as other labor issues could adversely affect our financial performance 

our future growth and performance depends on our ability to attract retain and motivate qualified employees many of whom are in positions with historically high rates of turnover our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling our labor costs is subject to many external factors including the competition for and availability of qualified personnel in a given market unemployment levels within those markets prevailing wage rates minimum wage laws health and other insurance costs and changes in employment and labor legislation including changes in the process for our employees to join a union or other workplace regulation including changes in entitlement programs such as health insurance and paid leave programs to the extent a significant portion of our employee base unionizes or attempts to unionize our labor costs could increase our ability to pass along labor costs is constrained 

also our stores are decentralized and are managed through a network of geographically dispersed management personnel our inability to effectively and efficiently operate our stores including the ability to control losses resulting from inventory and cash shrinkage may negatively affect our sales andor operating margins 

we are dependent upon the smooth functioning of our distribution network the capacity of our distribution centers and the timely receipt of inventory 

we rely upon the ability to replenish depleted inventory through deliveries to our distribution centers from vendors and from the distribution centers to our stores by various means of transportation including shipments by sea and truck labor shortages in the transportation industry could negatively affect transportation costs in addition longterm disruptions to the national and international transportation infrastructure that lead to delays or interruptions of service would adversely affect our business 

our planned future growth will be impeded which would adversely affect sales if we cannot open new stores on schedule or if we close a number of stores materially in excess of anticipated levels 

our growth is dependent on both increases in sales in existing stores and the ability to open profitable new stores our ability to timely open new stores and to expand into additional market areas depends in part on the following factors the availability of attractive store locations the absence of occupancy delays the ability to negotiate favorable lease terms the ability to hire and train new personnel especially store managers the ability to identify customer demand in different geographic areas general economic conditions and the availability of sufficient funds for expansion in addition many of these factors affect our ability to successfully relocate stores many of these factors are beyond our control in addition our substantial debt particularly combined with the recent tightening of the credit markets has made it more difficult for our real estate developers to obtain loans for our buildtosuit stores and to locate investors for those properties after they have been developed if this trend continues it could materially adversely impact our ability to open buildtosuit stores in desirable locations 

delays or failures in opening new stores or achieving lower than expected sales in new stores or drawing a greater than expected proportion of sales in new stores from existing stores could materially adversely affect our growth in addition we may not anticipate all of the challenges imposed by the expansion of our operations and as a result may not meet our targets for opening new stores remodeling or relocating stores or expanding profitably 

some of our new stores may be located in areas where we have little or no meaningful experience those markets may have different competitive conditions market conditions consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns than our existing markets which may cause our new stores to be less successful than stores in our existing markets 

some of our new stores will be located in areas where we have existing units although we have experience in these markets increasing the number of locations in these markets may result in inadvertent oversaturation of markets and temporarily or permanently divert customers and sales from our existing stores thereby adversely affecting our overall financial performance 

because our business is seasonal to a certain extent with the highest volume of net sales during the fourth quarter adverse events during the fourth quarter could materially affect our financial statements as a whole 

we generally recognize our highest volume of net sales during the christmas selling season which occurs in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year in anticipation of this holiday we purchase substantial amounts of seasonal inventory and hire many temporary employees a seasonal merchandise inventory imbalance could result if our net sales during the christmas selling season were to fall below either seasonal norms or expectations if our fourth quarter results were substantially below expectations our financial performance and operating results could be adversely affected by unanticipated markdowns especially in seasonal merchandise lower than anticipated sales in the christmas selling season would also negatively affect our ability to absorb the increased seasonal labor costs 

we face intense competition that could limit our growth opportunities and adversely impact our financial performance 

the retail business is highly competitive we operate in the discount retail merchandise business which is competitive with respect to price store location merchandise quality assortment and presentation instock consistency and customer service this competitive environment subjects us to the risk of adverse impact to our financial performance because of the lower prices and thus the lower margins required to maintain our competitive position also companies operating in the discount retail merchandise sector due to customer demographics and other factors may have limited ability to increase prices in response to increased costs including but not limited to vendor price increases this limitation may adversely affect our margins and financial performance we compete for customers employees store sites products and services and in other important aspects of our business with many other local regional and national retailers we compete with retailers operating discount mass merchandise grocery drug convenience variety and other specialty stores certain of our competitors have greater financial distribution marketing and other resources than we do these other competitors compete in a variety of ways including aggressive promotional activities merchandise selection and availability services offered to customers location store hours instore amenities and price if we fail to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets it could adversely affect our financial performance see “business—our industry —competitive strengths and —competition” for additional discussion of our competitive situation 

competition for customers has intensified in recent years as larger competitors have moved into or increased their presence in our geographic markets we remain vulnerable to the marketing power and high level of consumer recognition of these larger competitors and to the risk that these competitors or others could venture into the “dollar store” industry in a significant way generally we expect an increase in competition 

natural disasters unusually adverse weather conditions pandemic outbreaks boycotts and geopolitical events could adversely affect our financial performance 

the occurrence of one or more natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes unusually adverse weather conditions pandemic outbreaks boycotts and geopolitical events such as civil unrest in countries in which our suppliers are located and acts of terrorism or similar disruptions could adversely affect our operations and financial performance these events could result in physical damage to one or more of our properties increases in fuel or other energy prices or a fuel shortage the temporary or permanent closure of one or more of our stores or distribution centers delays in opening new stores the temporary lack of an adequate work force in a market the temporary or longterm disruption in the supply of products from some local and overseas suppliers the temporary disruption in the transport of goods from overseas delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution centers or stores the temporary reduction in the availability of products in our stores and disruption to our information systems these events also can have indirect consequences such as increases in the costs of insurance following a destructive hurricane season these factors could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations and financial performance 

the efficient operation of our business is heavily dependent upon our information systems 

we depend on a variety of information technology systems for the efficient functioning of our business such systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches and natural disasters damage or interruption to our computer systems may require a significant investment to fix or replace them and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim any material interruptions may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations

we also rely heavily on our information technology staff if we cannot meet our staffing needs in this area we may not be able to fulfill our technology initiatives while continuing to provide maintenance on existing systems we rely on certain software vendors to maintain and periodically upgrade many of these systems so that they can continue to support our business the software programs supporting many of our systems were licensed to us by independent software developers the inability of these developers or us to continue to maintain and upgrade these information systems and software programs would disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations if we were unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner in addition costs and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology or with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems could also disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations 

our current insurance program may expose us to unexpected costs and negatively affect our financial performance 

our insurance coverage reflects deductibles selfinsured retentions limits of liability and similar provisions that we believe are prudent based on the dispersion of our operations however there are types of losses we may incur but against which we cannot be insured or which we believe are not economically reasonable to insure such as losses due to acts of war employee and certain other crime and some natural disasters if we incur these losses and they are material our business could suffer certain material events may result in sizable losses for the insurance industry and adversely impact the availability of adequate insurance coverage or result in excessive premium increases to offset negative insurance market trends we may elect to selfinsure accept higher deductibles or reduce the amount of coverage in response to these market changes in addition we selfinsure a significant portion of expected losses under our workers’ compensation automobile liability general liability and group health insurance programs unanticipated changes in any applicable actuarial assumptions and management estimates underlying our recorded liabilities for these losses including expected increases in medical and indemnity costs could result in materially different amounts of expense than expected under these programs which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations although we continue to maintain property insurance for catastrophic events we are effectively selfinsured for losses up to the amount of our deductibles if we experience a greater number of these losses than we anticipate our financial performance could be adversely affected 

the investors control us and may have conflicts of interest with us now or in the future 

the investors indirectly own through their investment in parent a substantial portion of our common stock as a result the investors have control over our decisions to enter into any corporate transaction and the ability to prevent any transaction that requires shareholder approval regardless of whether others believe that the transaction is in our best interests for example the investors could cause us to make acquisitions that increase the amount of indebtedness that is secured or that is senior to our outstanding notes or to sell assets which may impair our ability to make payments under our outstanding notes

the investors are also in the business of making investments in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us the investors may also pursue acquisition opportunities that are complementary to our business and as a result those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us so long as the investors or other funds controlled by or associated with the investors continue to indirectly own a significant amount of our outstanding common stock even if such amount is less than 50 the investors will continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control our decisions







 item 2 

properties

executive overview 

we are the largest discount retailer in the united states by number of stores with approximately 8400 stores located in 35 states primarily in the southern southwestern midwestern and eastern united states we serve a broad customer base and offer a focused assortment of everyday items including basic consumable merchandise and other home apparel and seasonal products a majority of our products are priced at 10 or less and approximately 25 of our products are priced at 1 or less we seek to offer a compelling value proposition for our customers based on convenient store locations easy in and out shopping and quality merchandise in a friendly shopping environment at highly competitive prices we believe our combination of value and convenience distinguishes us from other discount convenience and drugstore retailers who typically focus on either value or convenience

the nature of our business is seasonal to a certain extent primarily because of sales of holidayrelated merchandise sales in our fourth quarter november december and january have historically been higher than sales achieved in each of the first three quarters of the fiscal year expenses and to a greater extent operating income vary by quarter results of a period shorter than a full year may not be indicative of results expected for the entire year furthermore the seasonal nature of our business may affect comparisons between periods it is important for you to read our more detailed discussion of financial and operating results below under “results of operations” basis points or “bps” amounts referred to below are equal to 001 percent as a percentage of sales

the customers we serve are valueconscious and dollar general has always been intently focused on helping our customers make the most of their spending dollars in 2008 consumers faced severe economic challenges including high gasoline and fuel costs rising food costs increased unemployment and the downturn in the housing and credit markets we believe that we benefited to some extent from the impact of consumers searching for good values on their basic purchases 

at the beginning of 2008 we defined four operating priorities as follows 1 drive productive sales growth 2 increase our gross margins 3 leverage process improvements and information technology to reduce costs and 4 strengthen and expand dollar generals culture of serving others these continue to be our principal operating priorities in 2009 coupled with the changes we made to our operations during the year in connection with these priorities which are discussed in more detail below we achieved the following financial highlights in fiscal 2008

·

total sales in fiscal 2008 were 105 billion a 101 increase from 2007 sales in samestores increased 90 and were driven by increases in customer traffic and average transaction amount average sales per square foot for all stores in 2008 were approximately 180 up from 165 in 2007 sales increases of highly consumable products outpaced our more discretionary categories likely the result of both our merchandising initiatives which were more focused on consumables and the negative effect of the economy on consumer discretionary spending 

·

gross profit as a percentage of sales was 293 in 2008 during the year we made progress in reducing our inventory shrinkage and improving the efficiencies of our distribution and transportation processes as well as leveraging fixed distribution costs improvements in our pricing systems and processes also permitted us to make more timely price changes to compensate for unavoidable cost increases and for the year markdowns declined

 

·

sga as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2008 was 234 this compares to 238 in the 2007 successor period and 245 in the 2007 predecessor period our increased sales levels favorably impacted sga as a percentage of sales in addition to a reduction in workers’ compensation expense resulting from safety initiatives implemented over the last several years and reduced advertising expense the 2007 predecessor period included sga of 450 million or 115 basis points related to closing underperforming stores

·

we recorded litigation expense of 32 million to reflect the settlement and related expenses net of insurance proceeds of a class action lawsuit filed as a result of the merger in 2007 we determined that the settlement was in our best interests to avoid costly and time consuming litigation

 

·

interest expense of 3919 million in 2008 relates primarily to interest on debt incurred to finance the merger we repaid all borrowings under our revolving credit facility in the first quarter of 2008 and incurred no additional borrowings during the year in january 2009 we further reduced our total longterm obligations by repurchasing 441 million of senior subordinated notes 

·

for fiscal 2008 we reported net income of 1082 million this compares to a net loss of 48 million in the 2007 successor period and a net loss of 80 million in the 2007 predecessor period each of which included significant costs related to the merger and other strategic initiatives as more fully described in the discussion below of 2008 vs 2007 

·

we generated 5752 million of cash from operating activities a portion of which we used to invest in our stores and to reduce longterm obligations at year end our cash balance of 378 million included 310 million invested in money market funds because of uncertainties in the current financial markets we believe maintaining excess liquidity is prudent

·

during 2008 we opened 207 new stores remodeled or relocated 404 stores and closed 39 stores resulting in a store count of 8362 on january 30 2009 in addition we are pleased with the progress we made during the year in our efforts to better utilize existing square footage and to improve the appearance of our stores 

 

discussion of operating priorities our first priority is driving productive sales growth by increasing shopper frequency and transaction amount and maximizing sales per square foot we utilized numerous initiatives in 2008 to enable productive sales growth for example we are defining and improving our store standards with a goal of developing a consistent look and feel across all stores we expanded convenience foods and beverages added new impulse racks at the checkout stands and expanded our store operating hours to further increase space utilization we have begun the process of raising the height of merchandise fixtures in our stores starting with the food area 

our second priority is to increase gross profit through shrink reduction distribution efficiencies an improved pricing model the expansion of private brand offerings and increased foreign sourcing in 2008 inventory shrink decreased as a result of several focused initiatives including the elimination of packaway inventories from the stockrooms the installation of additional security cameras the implementation of exceptionbased shrink detection tools and improved hiring practices and employee retention in 2008 higher sales volumes contributed to our ability to leverage transportation and distribution costs and we were able to offset the impact of higher average fuel costs for the year through better trailer utilization expansion of backhaul opportunities and improved fleet management we reviewed and reset our consumables planograms eliminating less productive items in order to add more productive ones in this process we reviewed our pricing strategy and worked diligently to minimize vendor cost increases some merchandise cost increases were unavoidable in 2008 but as a result of our improved pricing analysis tools we were able to recoup a portion of these increases through pricing we continue to focus on sales of private brand consumables which generally have higher gross profit rates while continuing to offer a wide variety of national brands in our efforts to offer the optimal mix of products to our customers with regard to the expansion of foreign sourcing we are still in the early stages of defining the objectives and building the team 

our third priority is leveraging process improvements and information technology to reduce costs we are committed as an organization to extract costs that do not affect the customer experience examples of cost reduction initiatives in 2008 include recycling of cardboard reduction of workers compensation expense through a focus on safety and improvement of energy management in the stores through installation and monitoring of new equipment with regard to information technology we are focusing our resources on improving systems that are designed to enhance retail store operations and merchandising

our fourth priority is to strengthen and expand dollar generals culture of serving others for customers this means helping them save time save money every day for employees this means creating an environment that attracts and retains key employees throughout the organization for communities this means giving back to our store communities 

in 2009 we plan to continue to focus on these same four operating priorities we will continue to refine and improve our store standards focusing on achieving a consistent look and feel across the chain and plan to measure customer satisfaction in 2009 we expect to complete the process of raising the height of our merchandise fixtures allowing us to better utilize our store square footage we will continue to focus on reducing inventory shrink by implementing additional analytical tools and expanding the utilization of surveillance equipment we have identified additional opportunities to reduce labor and other costs in our distribution centers in addition we plan to continue to expand our private brand consumables offerings and to increase and upgrade our private brand merchandise in the home and seasonal categories we intend to make strides in expanding our foreign sourcing efforts and expect to begin seeing a greater impact from this initiative in late 2009

with regard to leveraging information technology and process improvements to reduce costs we will continue to focus on making improvements that benefit our merchandising and operations efforts including projects such as pricing and profitability analysis merchandise selection and allocation and labor scheduling by the end of 2009 we expect each of our store managers to have access to a back office computer which will improve reporting and communications with the stores and consequently should assist us in improving store productivity 

finally in 2009 we plan to open 450 new stores within the 35 states in which we currently operate and to remodel or relocate an additional 400 stores with regard to planned new store openings our criteria are based on numerous factors including among other things availability of appropriate sites expected sales lease terms population demographics competition and the employment environment we use various real estate site selection tools to determine target markets and optimum site locations within those markets with regard to new store expansion in fiscal 2009 our plans include expansion only within our existing markets with respect to store relocations we begin to evaluate a store for relocation opportunities approximately 18 months prior to the store’s lease expiration using the same basic tools and criteria as those used for new stores remodels which require a much smaller investment are determined based on the need the opportunity for sales improvement at the location and an expectation of a desirable return on investment the majority of 2009’s new store sites have been identified and terms agreed to however due to uncertainties in the economy and its potential impact on commercial real estate sites and developers there is a heightened level of risk that these stores may not open as scheduled

 

we expect to continue to face difficult economic issues in 2009 which will restrict our customers’ ability to spend and therefore will challenge our efforts to increase sales and gross profit we also believe that competitive pricing promotions and advertising will continue and are likely to increase if overall retail sales continue to decline we remain committed to our 

operating model and to making improvements in our stores and our merchandise to better serve the needs of our customers

readers should refer to the detailed discussion of our operating results below for additional comments on financial performance in the current year periods as compared with the prior year periods 

results of operations 

the following table contains results of operations data for fiscal year 2008 the successor and predecessor periods in 2007 and fiscal year 2006

 

a

includes the results of operations of buck acquisition corp for the period prior to its merger with and into dollar general corporation from march 6 2007 its formation through july 6 2007 reflecting the change in fair value of interest rate swaps and the postmerger results of dollar general corporation for the period from july 7 2007 through february 1 2008

b

includes the premerger results of dollar general corporation for the period from february 3 2007 through july 6 2007

c

includes the impacts of certain strategic real estate and inventory management initiatives as described under the heading “strategic initiatives—project alpha” in item 1 above

the following discussion of our financial performance also includes supplemental unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information for fiscal years 2007 and 2006 because the merger occurred during our 2007 second quarter we believe this information aids in the comparison between the years presented the pro forma information does not purport to represent what our results of operations would have been had the merger and related transactions actually occurred at the beginning of the years indicated and they do not purport to project our results of operations or financial condition for any future period the following table contains results of operations data for 2008 compared to pro forma results of operations for fiscal years 2007 and 2006 and the dollar and percentage variances among those years see “unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information” below

 

net sales  the net sales increase in fiscal 2008 reflects a samestore sales increase of 9 compared to 2007 samestores include stores that have been open for 13 months and remain open at the end of the reporting period for the 2008 fiscal year there were 8153 samestores which accounted for sales of 1012 billion there were no purchase accounting or other adjustments to net sales as a result of the merger therefore the 2007 net sales and other amounts presented related to 2007 net sales are calculated using the 2007 52week fiscal year the remainder of the increase in sales in fiscal 2008 was attributable to new stores partially offset by sales from closed stores the increase in highly consumable sales reflects the various initiatives implemented in 2008 including the impact of improved store standards the expansion of convenience food and beverage offerings improved utilization of square footage and extended store hours the majority of our merchandising efforts in 2008 related to the highly consumable category including planogram resets and increased emphasis on private brand products as further discussed above in the executive overview both the number of customer transactions and average transaction amount increased for the year and we believe that our stores benefited to some degree from attracting new customers who are seeking value as a result of the current economic environment

 

the net sales increase in 2007 primarily reflects a samestore sales increase of 19 for the 2007 successor period and 26 for the predecessor period compared to the same periods in 2006 for the 2007 successor period there were 7735 samestores generating 526 billion of net sales and for the 2007 predecessor period there were 7655 samestores generating 366 billion of net sales sales resulting from new store growth including 170 new stores in the 2007 successor period and 195 stores in the 2007 predecessor period were partially offset by the impact of store closings in the 2007 predecessor and successor periods and in 2006 sales of highly consumables were 664 of total sales in the 2007 successor period and 666 of total sales in the 2007 predecessor period compared to 657 of total sales in 2006 resulting from successful changes during the 2007 periods to our consumables merchandising mix sales of seasonal merchandise increased slightly in dollars but declined as a percentage of total sales in the 2007 periods compared to 2006 apparel sales increased as a percentage of total sales in the 2007 periods compared to 2006 while home products sales decreased as a percentage of sales to some extent sales in these more discretionary categories were impacted by our efforts to eliminate our inventory packaway strategy by the end of 2007 and to reduce overall inventory levels in addition we believe sales of seasonal merchandise apparel and home products were negatively affected by continued economic pressures on our customers particularly in the fourth quarter of 2007 the increase in samestore sales represents an increase in average customer purchase offset by a slight decrease in customer traffic 

as discussed above we monitor our sales internally by the following four major categories highly consumable seasonal home products and basic clothing the highly consumable category has a lower gross profit rate than the other three categories and has grown significantly over the past several years because of the impact of sales mix on gross profit we continually review our merchandise mix and strive to adjust it when appropriate maintaining an appropriate sales mix is an integral part of achieving our gross profit and sales goals

gross profit  the gross profit rate as a percentage of sales was 293 in 2008 compared to 282 in the 2007 successor period 273 in the 2007 predecessor period and 278 for pro 

forma 2007 factors contributing to the increase in the 2008 gross profit rate include a lower inventory shrink rate lower promotional markdowns improved leverage on distribution and transportation costs and improved markups related to changes resulting from the outcome of pricing analysis our ability to react more quickly to product cost changes and diligent vendor negotiations in january 2009 we marked down merchandise as the result of a recent change in the interpretation of the phthalates provision of the consumer product safety improvement act of 2008 resulting in a charge of 86 million also in 2008 we faced increased commodity cost pressures mainly related to food and pet products which have been driven by rising fruit and vegetable prices and freight costs increases in petroleum resin metals pulp and other raw material commodity driven costs also resulted in multiple product cost increases related to these commodity cost increases we recorded a lifo provision of 439 million in 2008 compared to the lifo provision recorded in the 2007 successor period of 61 million we intend to address these commodity cost increases through negotiations with our vendors and by increasing retail prices as necessary on a quarterly basis we estimate the annual impact of commodity cost fluctuations based upon the best available information at that point in time

the gross profit rate as a percentage of sales was 273 in the 2007 predecessor period 282 in the 2007 successor period and 278 in pro forma 2007 compared to 258 in 2006 factors affecting the increase in the gross profit rate include lower markdowns including markdowns from retail and below cost markdowns markdowns in 2006 included significant markdowns and below cost adjustments relating to the move away from our packaway inventory strategy and improved leverage on distribution and transportation costs driven by logistics efficiencies the gross profit rate in the 2007 successor period was greater than in the predecessor period in part due to the seasonality of our sales which result in greater sales of higher margin discretionary purchases in the fourth quarter offsetting the factors listed above was an increase in our shrink rate in the 2007 periods as compared to 2006 and a shift in the mix of sales to more highly consumable products which have relatively lower gross profit rates

selling general and administrative “sga” expense  sga expense as a percentage of sales decreased to 234 in 2008 compared to 238 and 245 in the 2007 successor and predecessor periods respectively the more significant items resulting in the decrease in 2008 compared to the 2007 periods include approximately 90 million and 450 million in the 2007 successor and predecessor periods respectively including 24 million and 41 million respectively also included in advertising costs discussed below relating to the closing of stores and the elimination of our packaway inventory strategy 405 million in 2008 compared to 234 million in the 2007 successor period related to amortization of leasehold intangibles capitalized in connection with the revaluation of assets at the date of the merger a 120 million loss in the 2007 successor period compared to a 50 million gain in 2008 relating to potential losses on distribution center leases advertising costs of 278 million in 2008 compared to 236 million and 173 million in the 2007 successor and predecessor periods respectively and decreases in workers compensation and other insurancerelated costs compared to the 2007 periods these decreases were partially offset by an increase in incentive compensation and related payroll taxes in 2008 compared to the 2007 periods due to improved overall financial performance and an increase in professional fees in 2008 compared to the 2007 periods primarily reflecting legal expenses related to shareholder litigation

sga decreased to 234 in 2008 compared to 243 in pro forma 2007 the more significant items resulting in the decrease from the 2007 pro forma results include 540 million of costs in pro forma 2007 sga relating to the closing of stores and the elimination of our packaway inventory strategy a 120 million loss in the 2007 pro forma period compared to a 50 million gain in 2008 relating to possible losses on distribution center leases and decreases in workers compensation and other insurancerelated costs in 2008 of 104 million compared to the 2007 pro forma period these decreases were partially offset by an increase in incentive compensation and related payroll taxes of 420 million in 2008 compared to pro forma 2007 due to improved overall financial performance and an increase in professional fees in 2008 of 104 million compared to pro forma 2007 primarily reflecting legal expenses related to shareholder litigation

sga expense increased as a percentage of sales to 238 in the 2007 successor period and 245 in the 2007 predecessor period from 231 in 2006 sga in the 2007 periods includes 234 million in the 2007 successor period related to amortization of leasehold intangibles capitalized in connection with the revaluation of assets at the date of the merger 193 million and 76 million of administrative employee incentive compensation expense in the 2007 successor and predecessor periods respectively resulting from meeting certain financial targets compared to 96 million of discretionary bonuses in 2006 approximately 90 million and 450 million of expenses in the 2007 successor and predecessor periods respectively relating to the closing of stores and the elimination of our packaway inventory strategy compared to approximately 33 million in 2006 and an accrued loss of approximately 120 million in the 2007 successor period relating to probable losses for certain distribution center leases in addition sga in the 2007 successor period includes approximately 48 million of kkrrelated consulting and monitoring fees sga expense in 2006 was partially offset by insurance proceeds of 130 million received during the year related to losses incurred due to hurricane katrina

on a pro forma basis sga expense increased as a percentage of sales to 243 in 2007 compared to 238 in 2006 pro forma sga includes 269 million of administrative employee incentive compensation expense in 2007 resulting from meeting certain financial targets compared to 96 million of discretionary bonuses in 2006 approximately 54 million of expenses in 2007 relating to the closing of stores and the elimination of our packaway inventory strategy compared to approximately 33 million in 2006 and an accrued loss of approximately 120 million in 2007 relating to probable losses for certain distribution center leases sga expense in 2006 was partially offset by insurance proceeds of 130 million received during the year related to losses incurred due to hurricane katrina

litigation settlement and related costs net the 320 million in 2008 represents the settlement of a class action lawsuit filed in response to the merger and includes a 400 million settlement and estimated expenses of 20 million net of 100 million of insurance proceeds received in the fourth quarter of 2008

transaction and related costs the 12 million and 1014 million of expenses recorded in the 2007 successor and predecessor periods reflect 12 million and 620 million respectively of expenses related to the merger such as investment banking and legal fees as 

well as 394 million of compensation expense in the predecessor period related to stock options restricted stock and restricted stock units which were fully vested immediately prior to and as a result of the merger

interest income interest income consists primarily of interest on investments the decrease in interest income in 2008 compared to the 2007 periods was a result of lower interest rates partially offset by higher investments in the 2007 periods primarily the 2007 predecessor period we had higher levels of cash and short term investments on hand as compared to 2006

interest expense  the significant increase in interest expense in 2008 and the 2007 successor period subsequent to the merger is due to interest on longterm obligations incurred to finance the merger see further discussion under “liquidity and capital resources” below we had outstanding variablerate debt of 623 million and 787 million after taking into consideration the impact of interest rate swaps as of january 30 2009 and february 1 2008 respectively the remainder of our outstanding indebtedness at january 30 2009 and february 1 2008 was fixed rate debt 

interest expense in 2008 was less than 2007 pro forma interest expense due to lower borrowing amounts specifically on the revolving credit agreement and senior subordinated notes along with lower interest rates pro forma interest expense for both 2007 and 2006 was approximately 437 million

other income expense in 2008 we recorded a gain of 38 million resulting from the repurchase of 441 million of our senior subordinated notes offset by expense of 10 million related to hedge ineffectiveness related to certain interest rate swaps

during the 2007 successor period we recorded an unrealized loss of 41 million related to the change in the fair value of interest swaps prior to the designation of such swaps as cash flow hedges in october 2007 offset by earnings of 17 million under the contractual provisions of the swap agreements also during the 2007 successor period we recorded 62 million of expenses related to consent fees and other costs associated with a tender offer for certain notes payable maturing in june 2010 “2010 notes” approximately 99 of the 2010 notes were retired as a result of the tender offer the costs related to the tender of the 2010 notes were partially offset by a 49 million gain in the 2007 successor period resulting from the repurchase of 250 million of our senior subordinated notes 

income taxes  the effective income tax rates for 2008 the 2007 successor and predecessor periods and 2006 were an expense of 444 a benefit of 269 and expense of 3002 and 374 respectively 

the 2008 income tax rate is greater than the expected us statutory tax rate of 35 principally due to the nondeductibility of the settlement and related expenses associated with the mergerrelated shareholder lawsuit

the income tax rate for the successor period ended february 1 2008 is a benefit of 269 this benefit is less than the expected us statutory rate of 35 due to the incurrence of state income taxes in several of the group’s subsidiaries that file their state income tax returns on 

a separate entity basis and the election to include effective february 3 2007 income tax related interest and penalties in the amount reported as income tax expense

the income tax rate for the predecessor period ended july 6 2007 is an expense of 3002 this expense is higher than the expected us statutory rate of 35 due principally to the nondeductibility of certain acquisition related expenses

effects of inflation 

in 2008 increased commodity cost pressures mainly related to food and pet products which have been driven by fruit and vegetable prices and rising freight costs have increased the costs of certain products increases in petroleum resin metals pulp and other raw material commodity driven costs also resulted in multiple product cost increases we believe that our ability to increase selling prices in response to cost increases largely mitigated the effect of these cost increases on our overall results of operations we believe that inflation andor deflation had a minimal impact on our overall operations during 2007 and 2006

liquidity and capital resources 

current financial condition  recent developments  during the past three years we have generated an aggregate of approximately 14 billion in cash flows from operating 

activities during that period we expanded the number of stores we operate by approximately 5 433 stores remodeled or relocated over 9 of our currently operated stores 768 stores and incurred approximately 607 million in capital expenditures as noted above we made certain strategic decisions which slowed our store growth in 2007 and 2008 but we plan to accelerate store growth again in 2009

at january 30 2009 we had total outstanding debt including the current portion of longterm obligations of 414 billion we also had an additional 9328 million available for borrowing under our senior secured assetbased revolving credit facility at that date our liquidity needs are significant primarily due to our debt service and other obligations our substantial debt could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting our obligations under our outstanding debt securities

management believes our cash flow from operations and existing cash balances combined with availability under the credit facilities described below will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our current obligations projected working capital requirements and capital spending for a period that includes the next twelve months

credit facilities 

overview we have two senior secured credit facilities the “credit facilities” which provide financing of up to 3425 billion the credit facilities consist of a 23 billion senior secured term loan facility and a senior secured assetbased revolving credit facility of up to 1125 billion of which up to 3500 million is available for letters of credit subject to borrowing base availability the assetbased revolving credit facility includes borrowing capacity available for letters of credit and for shortterm borrowings referred to as swingline loans 

the agreements governing the credit facilities provide that we have the right at any time to request up to 3250 million of incremental commitments under one or more incremental term loan facilities andor assetbased revolving credit facilities the lenders under these facilities are not under any obligation to provide any such incremental commitments and any such addition of or increase in commitments will be subject to our not exceeding certain senior secured leverage ratios and certain other customary conditions precedent our ability to obtain extensions of credit under these incremental commitments also will be subject to the same conditions as extensions of credit under the credit facilities

the amount available under the senior secured assetbased credit facility including letters of credit shall not exceed the sum of the tranche a borrowing base and the tranche a1 borrowing base the tranche a borrowing base equals the sum of i 85 of the net orderly liquidation value of all our eligible inventory and that of each guarantor thereunder and ii 90 of all our accounts receivable and creditdebit card receivables and that of each guarantor thereunder in each case subject to a reserve equal to the principal amount of the 2010 notes that remain outstanding at any time and other customary reserves and eligibility criteria an 

additional 10 to 12 of the net orderly liquidation value of all of our eligible inventory and that of each guarantor thereunder is made available to us in the form of a “last out” tranche under which we may borrow up to a maximum amount of 1250 million borrowings under the assetbased credit facility will be incurred first under the last out tranche and no borrowings will be permitted under any other tranche until the last out tranche is fully utilized repayments of the senior secured assetbased revolving credit facility will be applied to the last out tranche only after all other tranches have been fully paid down 

interest rates and fees borrowings under the credit facilities bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus at our option either a libor or b a base rate which is usually equal to the prime rate the applicable margin for borrowings is i under the term loan facility 275 for libor borrowings and 175 for baserate borrowings ii as of january 30 2009 and february 1 2008 respectively under the assetbased revolving credit facility except in the last out tranche described above 125 and 150 for libor borrowings 025 and 050 for baserate borrowings and for any last out borrowings 225 for libor borrowings and 125 for baserate borrowings the applicable margins for borrowings under the assetbased revolving credit facility except in the case of last out borrowings are subject to adjustment each quarter based on average daily excess availability under the assetbased revolving credit facility we are also required to pay a commitment fee to the lenders under the assetbased revolving credit facility for any unutilized commitments at a rate of 0375 per annum we also must pay customary letter of credit fees see item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” below for a discussion of our use of interest rate swaps to manage our interest rate risk

prepayments the senior secured credit agreement for the term loan facility requires us to prepay outstanding term loans subject to certain exceptions with 

·

50 of our annual excess cash flow as defined in the credit agreement which will be reduced to 25 and 0 if we achieve and maintain a total net leverage ratio of 60 to 10 and 50 to 10 respectively 

·

100 of the net cash proceeds of all nonordinary course asset sales or other dispositions of property in excess of 250 million in the aggregate and subject to our right to reinvest the proceeds and

the mandatory prepayments discussed above will be applied to the term loan facility as directed by the senior secured credit agreement through january 30 2009 no prepayments have been required under the prepayment provisions listed above

in addition the senior secured credit agreement for the assetbased revolving credit facility requires us to prepay the assetbased revolving credit facility subject to certain exceptions with 

·

100 of the net cash proceeds of all nonordinary course asset sales or other dispositions of revolving facility collateral as defined below in excess of 10 million in the aggregate and subject to our right to reinvest the proceeds and

·

to the extent such extensions of credit exceed the then current borrowing base as defined in the senior secured credit agreement for the assetbased revolving credit facility 

we may be obligated to pay a prepayment premium on the amount repaid under the term loan facility if the term loans are voluntarily repaid in whole or in part before july 6 2009 we may voluntarily repay outstanding loans under the assetbased revolving credit facility at any time without premium or penalty other than customary “breakage” costs with respect to libor loans 

an event of default under the senior secured credit agreements will occur upon a change of control as defined in the senior secured credit agreements governing our credit facilities upon an event of default indebtedness under the credit facilities may be accelerated in which case we will be required to repay all outstanding loans plus accrued and unpaid interest and all other amounts outstanding under the credit facilities

amortization beginning september 30 2009 we are required to repay installments on the loans under the term loan credit facility in equal quarterly principal amounts in an aggregate amount per annum equal to 1 of the total funded principal amount at july 6 2007 with the balance payable on july 6 2014 there is no amortization under the assetbased revolving credit facility the entire principal amounts if any outstanding under the assetbased revolving credit facility are due and payable in full at maturity on july 6 2013 on which day the commitments thereunder will terminate 

guarantee and security all obligations under the credit facilities are unconditionally guaranteed by substantially all of our existing and future domestic subsidiaries excluding certain immaterial subsidiaries and certain subsidiaries designated by us under our senior secured credit agreements as “unrestricted subsidiaries” referred to collectively as us guarantors

at january 30 2009 we had no borrowings 510 million of commercial letters of credit and 837 million of standby letters of credit outstanding under our assetbased revolving credit facility

senior notes due 2015 and senior subordinated toggle notes due 2017 

overview we have 1175 billion aggregate principal amount of 10625 senior notes due 2015 the “senior notes” outstanding which mature on july 15 2015 pursuant to an indenture dated as of july 6 2007 the “senior indenture” and 6559 million aggregate principal amount of 1187512625 senior subordinated toggle notes due 2017 the “senior subordinated notes” outstanding which mature on july 15 2017 pursuant to an indenture dated as of july 6 2007 the “senior subordinated indenture” the senior notes and the senior subordinated notes are collectively referred to herein as the “notes” the senior indenture and the senior subordinated indenture are collectively referred to herein as the “indentures” we may redeem some or all of the notes at any time at redemption prices described or set forth in the indentures

interest on the notes is payable on january 15 and july 15 of each year interest on the senior notes is payable in cash cash interest on the senior subordinated notes accrues at a rate of 

11875 per annum and pik interest as that term is defined below accrues at a rate of 12625 per annum if applicable the initial interest payment on the senior subordinated notes was payable in cash for any interest period thereafter through july 15 2011 we may elect to pay interest on the senior subordinated notes i in cash ii by increasing the principal amount of the senior subordinated notes or issuing new senior subordinated notes “pik interest” or iii by paying interest on half of the principal amount of the senior subordinated notes in cash interest and half in pik interest after july 15 2011 all interest on the senior subordinated notes will be payable in cash through january 30 2009 all such interest has been paid in cash

the notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by each of the existing and future direct or indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries that guarantee the obligations under our credit facilities 

we may redeem some or all of the notes at any time at redemption prices described or set forth in the indentures we also may seek from time to time to retire some or all of the notes through cash purchases on the open market in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise such repurchases if any will depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors the amounts involved may be material we repurchased 441 million and 250 million of the senior subordinated notes in the fourth quarters of 2008 and 2007 respectively 

change of control upon the occurrence of a change of control which is defined in the indentures each holder of the notes has the right to require us to repurchase some or all of such holder’s notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101 of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest if any to the repurchase date

adjusted ebitda 

under the agreements governing the credit facilities and the indentures certain limitations and restrictions could arise if we are not able to satisfy and remain in compliance with specified financial ratios management believes the most significant of such ratios is the senior secured incurrence test under the credit facilities this test measures the ratio of the senior secured debt to adjusted ebitda this ratio would need to be no greater than 425 to 1 to avoid such limitations and restrictions as of january 30 2009 this ratio was 21 to 1 senior secured debt is defined as our total debt secured by liens or similar encumbrances less cash and cash equivalents ebitda is defined as income loss from continuing operations before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle plus interest and other financing costs net provision for income taxes and depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda is defined as ebitda further adjusted to give effect to adjustments required in calculating this covenant ratio under our credit facilities ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not presentations made in accordance with us gaap are not measures of financial performance or condition liquidity or profitability and should not be considered as an alternative to i net income operating income or any other performance measures determined in accordance with us gaap or ii operating cash flows determined in accordance with us gaap additionally ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not intended to be measures of free cash flow for management’s discretionary use as they do not consider certain cash requirements such as interest payments tax payments and debt service requirements and replacements of fixed assets 

our presentation of ebitda and adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under us gaap because not all companies use identical calculations these presentations of ebitda and adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies we believe that the presentation of ebitda and adjusted ebitda is appropriate to provide additional information about the calculation of this financial ratio in the credit facilities adjusted ebitda is a material component of this ratio specifically noncompliance with the senior secured indebtedness ratio contained in our credit facilities could prohibit us from making investments incurring liens making certain restricted payments and incurring additional secured indebtedness other than the additional funding provided for under the senior secured credit agreement and pursuant to specified exceptions   

the calculation of adjusted ebitda under the credit facilities is as follows

 

interest rate swaps 

we use interest rate swaps to minimize the risk of adverse changes in interest rates these swaps are intended to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure because of high correlation between the derivative financial instrument and the underlying exposure being hedged fluctuations in the value of the financial instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying economic exposure our principal interest rate exposure relates to outstanding amounts under our credit facilities at january 30 2009 we had interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of approximately 169 billion for more information see item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” below

fair value accounting 

we have classified our interest rate swaps as further discussed in item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” below in level 2 as defined by sfas 157 of the fair value hierarchy as the significant inputs to the overall valuations are based on market

observable data or information derived from or corroborated by marketobservable data including marketbased inputs to models model calibration to marketclearing transactions broker or dealer quotations or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency where models are used the selection of a particular model to value a derivative depends upon the contractual terms of and specific risks inherent in the instrument as well as the availability of pricing information in the market we use similar models to value similar instruments valuation models require a variety of inputs including contractual terms market prices yield curves credit curves measures of volatility and correlations of such inputs for our derivatives all of which trade in liquid markets model inputs can generally be verified and model selection does not involve significant management judgment 

to comply with the provisions of sfas 157 we incorporate credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty’s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements of our derivatives the credit valuation adjustments are calculated by determining the total expected exposure of the derivatives which incorporates both the current and potential future exposure and then applying each counterparty’s credit spread to the applicable exposure for derivatives with twoway exposure such as interest rate swaps the counterparty’s credit spread is applied to our exposure to the counterparty and our own credit spread is applied to the counterparty’s exposure to us and the net credit valuation adjustment is reflected in our derivative valuations the total expected exposure of a derivative is derived using marketobservable inputs such as yield curves and volatilities the inputs utilized for our own credit spread are based on implied spreads from our publiclytraded debt for counterparties with publicly available credit information the credit spreads over libor used in the calculations represent implied credit default swap spreads obtained from a third party credit data provider in adjusting the fair value of our derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk we have considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements such as collateral postings thresholds mutual puts and guarantees additionally we actively monitor counterparty credit ratings for any significant changes 

as of january 30 2009 the net credit valuation adjustments reduced the settlement values of our derivative liabilities by 85 million various factors impact changes in the credit valuation adjustments over time including changes in the credit spreads of the parties to the contracts as well as changes in market rates and volatilities which affect the total expected exposure of the derivative instruments when appropriate valuations are also adjusted for various factors such as liquidity and bidoffer spreads which factors we deemed to be immaterial as of january 30 2009 

other considerations 

our inventory balance represented approximately 44 of our total assets exclusive of goodwill and other intangible assets as of january 30 2009 our proficiency in managing our inventory balances can have a significant impact on our cash flows from operations during a given fiscal year as a result efficient inventory management has been and continues to be an area of focus for us

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of january 30 2009 in thousands

 

 

a

represents obligations for interest payments on longterm debt and capital lease obligations and includes projected interest on variable rate longterm debt based upon 2008 year end rates

b

we retain a significant portion of the risk for our workers’ compensation employee health insurance general liability property loss and automobile insurance as these obligations do not have scheduled maturities these amounts represent undiscounted estimates based upon actuarial assumptions reserves for workers’ compensation and general liability which existed as of the merger date were discounted in order to arrive at estimated fair value all other amounts are reflected on an undiscounted basis in our consolidated balance sheets

c

operating lease obligations are inclusive of amounts included in deferred rent and closed store obligations in our consolidated balance sheets

d

we entered into a monitoring agreement dated july 6 2007 with affiliates of certain of our investors pursuant to which those entities will provide management and advisory services such agreement has no contractual term and for purposes of this schedule is presumed to be outstanding for a period of five years

e

commercial commitments include information technology license and support agreements supplies fixtures letters of credit for import merchandise and other inventory purchase obligations

f

purchase obligations include legally binding agreements for software licenses and support supplies fixtures and merchandise purchases excluding such purchases subject to letters of credit

in 2008 and 2007 our south carolinabased wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary ashley river insurance company “aric” had investments in us government securities obligations of government sponsored enterprises short and longterm corporate obligations and assetbacked obligations these investments were held pursuant to south carolina regulatory requirements to maintain certain asset balances in relation to aric’s liability and equity balances which could limit our ability to use these assets for general corporate purposes in may 2008 the state of south carolina made certain changes to these regulatory requirements which had the effect of reducing the amounts and types of investments required allowing aric to liquidate investments primarily us government and corporate debt securities totaling 486 million during 2008 at january 30 2009 the asset balances held pursuant to these regulatory requirements equaled 200 million and were reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as cash and cash equivalents

in august 2005 we incurred significant losses caused by hurricane katrina primarily inventory and fixed assets in the form of store fixtures and leasehold improvements we reached final settlement of our related insurance claim in 2006 and received proceeds totaling 210 million due to these losses including 130 million in 2006 and 80 million prior to 2006 and have utilized a portion of these proceeds to replace lost assets insurance proceeds related to fixed assets are included in cash flows from investing activities and proceeds related to inventory losses and business interruption are included in cash flows from operating activities

legal actions claims and tax contingencies  as described in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements we are involved in a number of legal actions and claims some of which could potentially result in material cash payments adverse developments in those actions could materially and adversely affect our liquidity as discussed in note 5 we also have certain income taxrelated contingencies as more fully described below under “critical accounting policies and estimates” future negative developments could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity 

considerations regarding distribution center leases  the merger and certain of the related financing transactions may be interpreted as giving rise to certain trigger events which may include events of default under leases for three of our distribution centers “dcs” we do not believe such an interpretation would be appropriate under the terms of the leases during the 2007 successor period we concluded that a probable loss existed in connection with the lease contingencies and accrued sga expenses totaling 120 million in the successor statement of operations for the period ended february 1 2008 as of january 30 2009 70 million of such amount has been paid we believe that we have negotiated with the property owners proposed lease terms that would be implemented if the owners were to refinance or sell the property and that the resolution of these negotiations is primarily dependent on conditions in the real estate and financial markets we believe that any remaining potential loss on the resolution of these matters would currently be properly categorized as reasonably possible rather than probable and therefore reversed the remaining 50 million of previously recorded sga expenses during the year ended january 30 2009 however the possibility remains that the ultimate resolution of these matters could require us to make a significant cash investment to purchase these dcs

credit ratings on december 15 2008 standard  poor’s revised our longterm debt rating outlook to positive from stable and affirmed our longterm rating of b on september 18 2008 moody’s affirmed our longterm debt rating of b3 and changed the outlook to positive from stable these current ratings are considered noninvestment grade our current credit ratings as well as future rating agency actions could 1 negatively impact our ability to obtain financings to finance our operations on satisfactory terms 2 have the effect of increasing our financing costs and 3 have the effect of increasing our insurance premiums and collateral requirements necessary for our selfinsured programs

cash flows 

cash flows from operating activities 

a significant component of the change in cash flows from operating activities in 2008 compared to the 2007 periods was our strong operating performance due to greater sales higher gross margins and lower sga expenses as a percentage of sales partially offset by significantly higher interest expense as described in more 

detail above under “results of operations” in addition we experienced increased inventory turns and improved merchandise payment terms in 2008 as compared to the 2007 periods accounts payable balances increased by 1404 million in 2008 compared to a decline of 414 million in the 2007 successor period and an increase of 348 million in the 2007 predecessor period partially as a result of our implementation of initiatives to aggressively manage our payables also positively affecting cash flows from operations were increases in accrued expenses and other in 2008 which was primarily attributable to increases in litigation reserves incentive bonus accruals deferred vendor rebates and property and sales tax accruals other significant components of the change in cash flows from operating activities in 2008 as compared to 2007 were changes in inventory balances which increased by 10 in 2008 compared to decreases of approximately 6 and 1 during the 2007 successor and predecessor periods respectively inventory levels in the highly consumable category increased by 778 million or 12 in 2008 compared to a decline of 907 million or 12 in the 2007 successor period and an increase of 488 million or 7 in the 2007 predecessor period the seasonal category increased by 209 million or 8 in 2008 compared to a decline of 242 million or 8 in the 2007 successor period and a decline of 387 million or 11 in the 2007 predecessor period the home products category declined by 26 million or 2 in 2008 compared to an increase of 254 million or 19 in the 2007 successor period and a decline of 150 million or 10 in the 2007 predecessor period the basic clothing category increased by 302 million or 15 in 2008 compared to an increase of 100 million or 5 in the 2007 successor period and a decline of 115 million or 5 in the 2007 predecessor period in addition net income in 2008 compared to the net losses in the 2007 periods discussed above was a principal factor in the increase in income taxes paid in 2008 income tax refunds received in 2007 for taxes paid in prior years that did not reoccur in 2008 also contributed to the increase in income taxes paid during 2008

cash flows from operating activities for the 2007 periods were impacted by a net loss of 48 million and 80 million in the 2007 successor and predecessor periods respectively compared to net income of 1379 million in 2006 as described in detail under “results of operations” above including the incurrence of 1014 million of transaction and related costs in the 2007 predecessor period other significant components of the change in cash flows from operating activities in 2007 as compared to 2006 were changes in inventory balances which decreased by approximately 6 and 1 during the 2007 successor and predecessor periods respectively compared to a decrease of approximately 3 during 2006 as compared to changes in inventory levels in the 2007 periods discussed above in 2006 highly consumable increased 632 million or 10 seasonal increased 67 million or 2 home products decreased 525 million or 25 and basic clothing decreased 595 million or 21 in addition to inventory changes the net losses in the 2007 periods discussed above were principal factors in the reduction in income taxes paid in those periods as compared to 2006 also offsetting the decline in net income were changes in accrued expenses particularly in the 2007 predecessor period as compared to 2006 which was primarily attributable to income tax related reserves accruals for lease liabilities on closed stores and property and sales tax accruals

cash flows from investing activities  cash flows used in investing activities totaling 1526 million in 2008 were primarily related to capital expenditures and sales of investments significant components of our property and equipment purchases in 2008 included the following 

approximate amounts 149 million for improvements upgrades remodels and relocations of existing stores 22 million for new stores 17 million for distribution and transportationrelated capital expenditures and 13 million for information systems upgrades and technologyrelated projects during 2008 we opened 207 new stores and remodeled or relocated 404 stores

purchases and sales of shortterm investments which equaled net sales of 516 million in 2008 primarily reflect our investment activities in our captive insurance subsidiary including a change in regulatory requirements as discussed in more detail above under “other considerations”

the merger as discussed in more detail above required cash payments in the 2007 successor period of approximately 67 billion net of cash acquired of 350 million significant components of property and equipment purchases in the 2007 successor period included the following approximate amounts 45 million for improvements upgrades remodels and relocations of existing stores 23 million for distribution and transportationrelated capital expenditures and 16 million for new stores during the 2007 successor period we opened 170 new stores and remodeled or relocated 235 stores significant components of property and equipment purchases in the 2007 predecessor period included the following approximate amounts 29 million for new stores 15 million for improvements upgrades remodels and relocations of existing stores and 7 million for distribution and transportationrelated capital expenditures during the 2007 predecessor period we opened 195 new stores and remodeled or relocated 65 stores

during the 2007 successor period we purchased a secured promissory note for 370 million which represents debt issued by a thirdparty entity from which we lease our distribution center in ardmore oklahoma purchases and sales of shortterm investments which equaled net sales of 176 million and 44 million in the respective 2007 successor and predecessor periods primarily reflect our investment activities in our captive insurance subsidiary and all purchases of longterm investments were related to the captive insurance subsidiary

cash flows used in investing activities totaling 2820 million in 2006 were primarily related to capital expenditures and to a lesser degree purchases of longterm investments significant components of our property and equipment purchases in 2006 included the following approximate amounts 66 million for distribution and transportationrelated capital expenditures including approximately 30 million related to our distribution center in marion indiana which opened in 2006 66 million for new stores 50 million for a capital project designed to improve inventory flow from our dcs to consumers and 38 million for capital projects in existing stores during 2006 we opened 537 new stores and remodeled or relocated 64 stores

purchases and sales of shortterm investments in 2006 which equaled net sales of 19 million reflect our investment activities in taxexempt auction rate securities as well as investing activities of our captive insurance subsidiary purchases of longterm investments are related to the captive insurance subsidiary

capital expenditures during 2009 are projected to be in the range of 250275 million we anticipate funding 2009 capital requirements with cash flows from operations and our revolving credit facility if necessary significant components of the 2009 capital plan include 

growth initiatives including leasehold improvements fixtures and equipment for approximately 450 new stores continued investment in our existing store base with plans for remodeling and relocating approximately 400 stores and additional investments in our supply chain and information technology we plan to undertake these expenditures in order to improve our infrastructure and increase our cash generated from operating activities

cash flows from financing activities  in 2008 we repaid borrowings of 1025 million under our revolving credit facility and as of january 30 2009 we had no borrowings under the revolving credit facility also during 2008 we repurchased 441 million of our outstanding senior subordinated notes

in the 2007 successor period to finance the merger we issued longterm debt of approximately 42 billion and issued common stock in the amount of approximately 28 billion primarily relating to the cash equity contributions from the investors we incurred costs associated with the issuance of mergerrelated longterm debt of 874 million we completed a cash tender offer for our 2010 notes as discussed above resulting in the valid tender of approximately 99 of the 2010 notes resulting in repayments of longterm debt and related consent fees in the amount of 2156 million and incurred borrowings net of repayments under our new assetbased revolving credit facility of 1025 million

cash flows used in financing activities during 2006 included the repurchase of approximately 45 million shares of the predecessor’s common stock at a total cost of 799 million cash dividends paid of 625 million or 020 per share on the predecessor’s outstanding common stock and 141 million to reduce our outstanding capital lease and financing obligations these uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options during 2006 of 199 million

the borrowings and repayments under the revolving credit agreements in 2008 the 2007 successor period and 2006 were primarily a result of activity associated with periodic cash needs

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures in addition to the estimates presented below there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed critical as defined below we believe these estimates are reasonable and appropriate however if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used the resulting changes could have a material effect on the financial statements taken as a whole 

management believes the following policies and estimates are critical because they involve significant judgments assumptions and estimates management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosures presented below relating to those policies and estimates

merchandise inventories  merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined using the retail lastin firstout “lifo” method under our retail inventory method “rim” the calculation of gross profit and the resulting valuation of inventories at cost are computed by applying a calculated costtoretail inventory ratio to the retail value of sales at a department level the rim is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality also it is recognized that the use of the rim will result in valuing inventories at the lower of cost or market “lcm” if markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories

inherent in the rim calculation are certain significant management judgments and estimates including among others initial markups markdowns and shrinkage which significantly impact the gross profit calculation as well as the ending inventory valuation at cost these significant estimates coupled with the fact that the rim is an averaging process can under certain circumstances produce distorted cost figures factors that can lead to distortion in the calculation of the inventory balance include

·

applying the rim to a group of products that is not fairly uniform in terms of its cost and selling price relationship and turnover

·

applying the rim to transactions over a period of time that include different rates of gross profit such as those relating to seasonal merchandise

·

inaccurate estimates of inventory shrinkage between the date of the last physical inventory at a store and the financial statement date and

·

inaccurate estimates of lcm andor lifo reserves

factors that reduce potential distortion include the use of historical experience in estimating the shrink provision see discussion below and recent improvements in the annual lifo analysis whereby all skus are considered in the index formulation an actual valuation of inventory under the lifo method can be made only at the end of each year based on the inventory levels and costs at that time accordingly interim lifo calculations are based on management’s estimates of expected yearend inventory levels sales for the year and the expected rate of inflationdeflation for the year and are thus subject to adjustment in the final yearend lifo inventory valuation we also perform interim inventoryaging analysis for determining obsolete inventory our policy is to write down inventory to an lcm value based on various management assumptions including estimated markdowns and sales required to liquidate such aged inventory in future periods inventory is reviewed on a quarterly basis and adjusted as appropriate to reflect writedowns determined to be necessary

factors such as slower inventory turnover due to changes in competitors’ tactics consumer preferences consumer spending and unseasonable weather patterns among other factors could cause excess inventory requiring greater than estimated markdowns to entice consumer purchases resulting in an unfavorable impact on our consolidated financial statements sales shortfalls due to the above factors could cause reduced purchases from vendors and 

associated vendor allowances that would also result in an unfavorable impact on our consolidated financial statements 

 

we calculate our shrink provision based on actual physical inventory results during the fiscal period and an accrual for estimated shrink occurring subsequent to a physical inventory through the end of the fiscal reporting period this accrual is calculated as a percentage of sales at each retail store at a department level and is determined by dividing the booktophysical inventory adjustments recorded during the previous twelve months by the related sales for the same period for each store to the extent that subsequent physical inventories yield different results than this estimated accrual our effective shrink rate for a given reporting period will include the impact of adjusting the estimated results to the actual results although we perform physical inventories in virtually all of our stores on an annual basis the same stores do not necessarily get counted in the same reporting periods from year to year which could impact comparability in a given reporting period

goodwill and other intangible assets we amortize intangible assets over their estimated useful lives unless such lives are deemed indefinite if impairment indicators are noted amortizable intangible assets are tested for impairment based on projected undiscounted cash flows and if impaired written down to fair value based on either discounted projected cash flows or appraised values future cash flow projections are based on management’s projections significant judgments required in this testing process may include projecting future cash flows determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions projections are based on management’s best estimates given recent financial performance market trends strategic plans and other available information changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value or impairment future indicators of impairment could result in an asset impairment charge

under sfas 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” we are required to test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators occur the goodwill impairment test is a twostep process that requires management to make judgments in determining what assumptions to use in the calculation the first step of the process consists of estimating the fair value of our reporting unit based on valuation techniques including a discounted cash flow model using revenue and profit forecasts and comparing that estimated fair value with the recorded carrying value which includes goodwill if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment by determining an “implied fair value” of goodwill the determination of the “implied fair value” of goodwill would require us to allocate the estimated fair value of our reporting unit to its assets and liabilities any unallocated fair value represents the “implied fair value” of goodwill which would be compared to its corresponding carrying value

we performed our annual impairment tests of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets during the third quarter of 2008 based on conditions as of the end of our second quarter and subsequently reviewed such results as of the end of 2008 these analyses indicated that no impairment was necessary we are not currently projecting a decline in cash flows that could be expected to have an adverse effect such as a violation of debt covenants or future impairment charges

purchase accounting the merger was accounted for as a reverse acquisition in accordance with the purchase accounting provisions of sfas 141 “business combinations” under which our assets and liabilities have been accounted for at their estimated fair values as of the date of the merger the aggregate purchase price was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon an assessment of their relative fair values as of the date of the merger these estimates of fair values the allocation of the purchase price and other factors related to the accounting for the merger are subject to significant judgments and the use of estimates

property and equipment  property and equipment are recorded at cost we group our assets into relatively homogeneous classes and generally provide for depreciation on a straightline basis over the estimated average useful life of each asset class except for leasehold improvements which are amortized over the lesser of the applicable lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset certain store and warehouse fixtures when fully depreciated are removed from the cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization accounts the valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful depreciable lives involves significant judgments and the use of estimates

impairment of longlived assets we review the carrying value of all longlived assets for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” we review for impairment stores open for approximately two years or more for which recent cash flows from operations are negative impairment results when the carrying value of the assets exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the life of the lease our estimate of undiscounted future cash flows over the lease term is based upon historical operations of the stores and estimates of future store profitability which encompasses many factors that are subject to variability and are difficult to predict if a longlived asset is found to be impaired the amount recognized for impairment is equal to the difference between the carrying value and the asset’s estimated fair value the fair value is estimated based primarily upon future cash flows discounted at our credit adjusted riskfree rate or other reasonable estimates of fair market value in accordance with us gaap

we recorded impairment charges included in sga expense of approximately 40 million in 2008 02 million in the 2007 predecessor period and 94 million in 2006 to reduce the carrying value of certain of our stores’ assets as deemed necessary based on our evaluation that such amounts would not be recoverable primarily due to insufficient sales or excessive costs resulting in negative current and projected future cash flows at these locations such assets to the extent still functional are held for use in other store locations the majority of the 2006 charges were recorded pursuant to certain strategic initiatives discussed above

insurance liabilities  we retain a significant portion of the risk for our workers’ compensation employee health insurance general liability property loss and automobile coverage these costs are significant primarily due to the large employee base and number of stores at the date of the merger the liability for workers’ compensation and general liability was discounted in accordance with purchase accounting standards subsequent to the merger 

provisions are made to these insurance liabilities on an undiscounted basis based on actual claim data and estimates of incurred but not reported claims developed using actuarial methodologies based on historical claim trends if future claim trends deviate from recent historical patterns we may be required to record additional expenses or expense reductions which could be material to our future financial results

contingent liabilities – income taxes income tax reserves are determined using the methodology established by the financial accounting standards board “fasb” interpretation 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes – an interpretation of fasb statement 109 “fin 48” fin 48 which we adopted on february 3 2007 requires companies to assess each income tax position taken using a two step process a determination is first made as to whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained based upon the technical merits upon examination by the taxing authorities if the tax position is expected to meet the more likely than not criteria the benefit recorded for the tax position equals the largest amount that is greater than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement of the respective tax position uncertain tax positions require determinations and estimated liabilities to be made based on provisions of the tax law which may be subject to change or varying interpretation if our determinations and estimates prove to be inaccurate the resulting adjustments could be material to our future financial results

contingent liabilities  legal matters  we are subject to legal regulatory and other proceedings and claims we establish liabilities as appropriate for these claims and proceedings based upon the probability and estimability of losses and to fairly present in conjunction with the disclosures of these matters in our financial statements and sec filings management’s view of our exposure we review outstanding claims and proceedings with external counsel to assess probability and estimates of loss we reevaluate these assessments on a quarterly basis or as new and significant information becomes available to determine whether a liability should be established or if any existing liability should be adjusted the actual cost of resolving a claim or proceeding ultimately may be substantially different than the amount of the recorded liability in addition because it is not permissible under us gaap to establish a litigation liability until the loss is both probable and estimable in some cases there may be insufficient time to establish a liability prior to the actual incurrence of the loss upon verdict and judgment at trial for example or in the case of a quickly negotiated settlement see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements

lease accounting and excess facilities  the majority of our stores are subject to shortterm leases usually with initial or current terms of 3 to 5 years with multiple renewal options when available we also have stores subject to buildtosuit arrangements with landlords which typically carry a primary lease term of 10 years with multiple renewal options approximately 42 of our stores have provisions for contingent rentals based upon a percentage of defined sales volume we recognize contingent rental expense when the achievement of specified sales targets is considered probable we recognize rent expense over the term of the lease we record minimum rental expense on a straightline basis over the base noncancelable lease term commencing on the date that we take physical possession of the property from the landlord which normally includes a period prior to store opening to make necessary leasehold improvements and install store fixtures when a lease contains a predetermined fixed escalation of the minimum rent we recognize the related rent expense on a straightline basis and record 

the difference between the recognized rental expense and the amounts payable under the lease as deferred rent tenant allowances to the extent received are recorded as deferred incentive rent and amortized as a reduction to rent expense over the term of the lease we reflect as a liability any difference between the calculated expense and the amounts actually paid improvements of leased properties are amortized over the shorter of the life of the applicable lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset

for store closures excluding those associated with a business combination where a lease obligation still exists we record the estimated future liability associated with the rental obligation on the date the store is closed in accordance with sfas 146 “accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities” based on an overall analysis of store performance and expected trends management periodically evaluates the need to close underperforming stores liabilities are established at the point of closure for the present value of any remaining operating lease obligations net of estimated sublease income and at the communication date for severance and other exit costs as prescribed by sfas 146 key assumptions in calculating the liability include the timeframe expected to terminate lease agreements estimates related to the sublease potential of closed locations and estimation of other related exit costs if actual timing and potential termination costs or realization of sublease income differ from our estimates the resulting liabilities could vary from recorded amounts these liabilities are reviewed periodically and adjusted when necessary 

sharebased payments  our sharebased stock option awards are valued on an individual grant basis using the blackscholesmerton closed form option pricing model the application of this valuation model involves assumptions that are judgmental and highly sensitive in the valuation of stock options which affects compensation expense related to these options these assumptions include an estimate of the fair value of our common stock as our stock is not publicly traded the term that the options are expected to be outstanding an estimate of the volatility of our stock price which is based on a peer group of publicly traded companies applicable interest rates and the dividend yield of our stock other factors involving judgments that affect the expensing of sharebased payments include estimated forfeiture rates of sharebased awards if our estimates differ materially from actual experience we may be required to record additional expense or reductions of expense which could be material to our future financial results

fair value measurements we measure fair value of financial assets and liabilities in accordance with sfas 157 which requires that fair values be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability sfas 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity observable inputs that are classified within levels 1 and 2 of the hierarchy and the reporting entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions unobservable inputs classified within level 3 of the hierarchy therefore level 3 inputs are typically based on an entity’s own assumptions as there is little if any related market activity and thus requires the use of significant judgment and estimates

our fair value measurements are primarily associated with our derivative financial instruments and to a lesser degree our mutual fund holdings the values of our derivative 

financial instruments are determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative this analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives including the period to maturity and uses observable marketbased inputs including interest rate curves the fair values of interest rate swaps are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash payments or receipts and the discounted expected variable cash receipts or payments the variable cash receipts or payments are based on an expectation of future interest rates forward curves derived from observable market interest rate curves 

derivative financial instruments we account for derivative instruments in accordance with sfas 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” as amended and interpreted sfas 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives and for hedging activities sfas 133 requires that every derivative instrument be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value and that changes in the derivative’s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met see “fair value measurements” above for a discussion of derivative valuations special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative’s gains and losses to either offset related results on the hedged item in the statement of operations or be accumulated in other comprehensive income and requires that a company formally document designate and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting we use derivative instruments to manage our exposure to changing interest rates primarily with interest rate swaps 

in addition to making valuation estimates we also bear the risk that certain derivative instruments that have been designated as hedges and currently meet the strict hedge accounting requirements of sfas 133 may not qualify in the future as “highly effective” as defined as well as the risk that hedged transactions in cash flow hedging relationships may no longer be considered probable to occur further new interpretations and guidance related to sfas no 133 may be issued in the future and we cannot predict the possible impact that such guidance may have on our use of derivative instruments going forward

adoption of accounting standards 

in may 2008 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 162 “the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles” sfas 162 identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles used in the preparation of financial statements of nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states the gaap hierarchy sfas 162 became effective in november 2008 the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our financial statements

on february 2 2008 we adopted components of sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” we have not adopted sfas 157 for nonfinancial assets and liabilities sfas 157 defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements sfas 157 applies to reported balances that are required or 

permitted to be measured at fair value under existing accounting pronouncements accordingly the standard does not require any new fair value measurements of reported balances

we adopted the provisions of fin 48 effective february 3 2007 the adoption resulted in an 89 million decrease in retained earnings and a reclassification of certain amounts between deferred income taxes and other noncurrent liabilities to conform to the balance sheet presentation requirements of fin 48 as of the date of adoption the total reserve for uncertain tax benefits was 779 million this reserve excludes the federal income tax benefit for the uncertain tax positions related to state income taxes which is now included in deferred tax assets as a result of the adoption of fin 48 the reserve for interest expense related to income taxes was increased to 153 million and a reserve for potential penalties of 19 million related to uncertain income tax positions was recorded as of the date of adoption approximately 271 million of the reserve for uncertain tax positions would have impacted our effective income tax rate subsequently if we were to recognize the tax benefit for these positions

subsequent to the adoption of fin 48 we elected to record income tax related interest and penalties as a component of the provision for income tax expense

accounting pronouncements 

in march 2008 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 161 “disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities” an amendment of fasb statement 133 sfas 161 applies to all derivative instruments and nonderivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments pursuant to paragraphs 37 and 42 of sfas 133 and related hedged items accounted for under sfas 133 sfas 161 requires entities to provide greater transparency through additional disclosures about how and why an entity uses derivative instruments how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under sfas 133 and its related interpretations and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s financial position results of operations and cash flows sfas 161 is effective as of the beginning of an entity’s first fiscal year that begins after november 15 2008 we plan to adopt sfas 161 during the first quarter of our 2009 fiscal year and its impact is expected to be limited to the additional disclosures discussed above

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 141r “business combinations” the new standard establishes the requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest formerly minority interest in an acquiree provides updated requirements for recognition and measurement of goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase and provides updated disclosure requirements to enable users of financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination this statement applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december 15 2008 early adoption is not allowed unless a qualifying transaction is consummated subsequent to the effective date the adoption of this standard on our financial statements is expected to be limited to any future mergerrelated adjustments to uncertain tax positions that would if subsequently recognized impact our results of operations rather than goodwill

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas 157 “fair value measurements” sfas 157 provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities the standard also requires expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value the information used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings sfas 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years for nonfinancial assets and liabilities the effective date has been delayed to fiscal years beginning after november 15 2008 we currently expect to adopt the components of sfas 157 relating to nonfinancial assets and liabilities during 2009 we are in the process of evaluating the potential impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements




 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

financial risk management 

we are exposed to market risk primarily from adverse changes in interest rates and to a lesser degree commodity prices to minimize this risk we may periodically use financial instruments including derivatives as a matter of policy we do not buy or sell financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes and all derivative financial instrument transactions must be authorized and executed pursuant to approval by the board of directors all financial instrument positions taken by us are intended to be used to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure because of high correlation between the derivative financial instrument and the underlying exposure being hedged fluctuations in the value of the financial instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying economic exposure

interest rate risk 

we manage our interest rate risk through the strategic use of fixed and variable interest rate debt and from time to time derivative financial instruments our principal interest rate exposure relates to outstanding amounts under our credit facilities our credit facilities provide for variable rate borrowings of up to 3425 billion including availability of 1125 billion under our senior secured assetbased revolving credit facility subject to the borrowing base in order to mitigate a portion of the variable rate interest exposure under the credit facilities we entered into interest rate swaps which became effective on july 31 2007 pursuant to the swaps we swapped three month libor rates for fixed interest rates resulting in the payment of an allin fixed rate of 768 on an original notional amount of 20 billion originally scheduled to amortize on a quarterly basis until maturity at july 31 2012 

on october 3 2008 a counterparty to one of our 2007 swap agreements declared bankruptcy which constituted a technical default under this contract and on october 30 2008 we terminated this swap agreement we subsequently cash settled the swap on november 10 2008 for approximately 76 million including interest accrued to the date of termination as of january 30 2009 the notional amount under the remaining 2007 swaps is 8667 million 

 

effective february 28 2008 we entered into a 3500 million stepdown interest rate swap in order to mitigate an additional portion of the variable rate interest exposure under the credit facilities under the terms of this agreement we swapped one month libor rates for fixed interest rates which will result in the payment of a fixed rate of 558 on a notional amount of 3500 million for the first year and 1500 million for the second year 

effective december 31 2008 we entered into a 4750 million interest rate swap in order to mitigate an additional portion of the variable rate interest exposure under the credit facilities this swap is scheduled to mature on january 31 2013 under the terms of this agreement we swapped one month libor rates for fixed interest rates which will result in the payment of a fixed rate of 506 on a notional amount of 4750 million through april 2010 4000 million from may 2010 to october 2011 and 3000 million to maturity 

a change in interest rates on variable rate debt impacts our pretax earnings and cash flows whereas a change in interest rates on fixed rate debt impacts the economic fair value of debt but not our pretax earnings and cash flows our interest rate swaps qualify for hedge accounting as cash flow hedges therefore changes in market fluctuations related to the effective portion of these cash flow hedges do not impact our pretax earnings until the accrued interest is recognized on the derivatives and the associated hedged debt based on our outstanding debt as of january 30 2009 and assuming that our mix of debt instruments derivative instruments and other variables remain the same the annualized effect of a one percentage point change in variable interest rates would have a pretax impact on our earnings and cash flows of approximately 62 million

the interest rate swaps are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” as amended and interpreted collectively “sfas 133” sfas 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 133 requires that all derivatives be recognized as either assets or liabilities at fair value

the conditions and uncertainties in the global credit markets have substantially increased the credit risk of other counterparties to our swap agreements in the event such counterparties fail to perform under our swap agreements and we are unable to enter into new swap agreements on terms favorable to us our ability to effectively manage our interest rate risk may be materially impaired we attempt to manage counterparty credit risk by periodically evaluating the financial position and creditworthiness of such counterparties monitoring the amount for which we are at risk with each counterparty and where possible dispersing the risk among multiple counterparties there can be no assurance that we will manage or mitigate our counterparty credit risk effectively

controls and procedures 

a 

disclosure controls and procedures under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined under rule 13a15e or 15d15e promulgated under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” based on this evaluation our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report

  

b 

management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting our management prepared and is responsible for the consolidated financial statements and all related financial information contained in this report this responsibility includes establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f or 15d15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles

to comply with the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanes–oxley act of 2002 management designed and implemented a structured and comprehensive assessment process to evaluate its internal control over financial reporting such assessment was based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission because of its inherent limitations a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements management regularly monitors our internal control over financial reporting and actions are taken to correct any deficiencies as they are identified based on its assessment management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as of january 30 2009 

this annual report does not include an attestation report of ernst  young llp regarding internal control over financial reporting management’s report was not subject to attestation by ernst  young llp pursuant to temporary rules of the securities and exchange commission that permit us to provide only management’s report in this annual report

c 

changes in internal control over financial reporting  there have been no changes during the quarter ended january 30 2009 in our internal control over financial reporting as defined in exchange act rule 13a15f that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

other information 

named executive officer base salary adjustments 

on march 18 2009 the compensation committee of our board of directors approved annual base salary increases for each of our named executive officers listed below the “named executive officers” all to be effective april 1 2009 mr dreiling’s base salary increase was recommended by the compensation committee and on march 19 2009 approved by the board of directors

 

named executive officer bonus program 

on march 18 2009 the compensation committee approved the fiscal 2009 annual bonus program the “2009 teamshare program” applicable to the named executive officers among others mr dreiling’s participation in the 2009 teamshare program to the extent not otherwise required by the terms of his employment agreement with us was recommended by the compensation committee and on march 19 2009 approved by the board of directors 

under the 2009 teamshare program the named executive officers will be eligible to receive a cash bonus payment equal to a certain percentage of base salary based upon the company’s achievement in fiscal 2009 of a preestablished financial performance measure based upon earnings before interest taxes amortization and depreciation “ebitda” with adjustments similar to those made for purposes of calculating performance targets for our longterm incentive program including exclusions for the impact of a any fee paid to kohlberg kravis roberts  co goldman sachs  co and any affiliates thereof pursuant to the terms of the monitoring fee letter agreement dated july 6 2007 b all consulting accounting legal valuation banking filing disclosure and similar costs fees and expenses directly related to the consideration negotiation approval and consummation of the proposed acquisition and related financing of the company by affiliates of kohlberg kravis roberts  co including without limitation any costs fees and expenses relating to the filing and maintenance of the form s1 market maker registration statement and any litigation or settlement of any litigation related thereto c any costs fees and expenses directly related to the consideration negotiation and 

consummation of any public offering of our common stock or any asset sale merger or other transaction that results in a changeincontrol of the company and d any unplanned items of a nonrecurring or extraordinary nature as determined in good faith by the ceo and cfo and approved by the committee

the committee established a target financial performance level for purposes of the 2009 teamshare program at a level equal to the company’s annual financial objective the committee also established the threshold financial performance level below which no bonus may be paid under the 2009 teamshare program at 95 of the target financial performance level there is no maximum level of ebitda performance associated with the 2009 teamshare program although any individual payout under the program is capped at 25 million

the committee considers the 2009 teamshare program target financial performance level to be challenging and generally consistent with the level of difficulty of achievement associated with our performancebased awards for prior years we did not achieve the threshold teamshare performance level in fiscal years 2006 or 2005 we achieved teamshare performance levels between threshold and target in fiscal year 2004 between target and maximum in fiscal year 2007 and at maximum in fiscal year 2003 fiscal 2008 was the first year in which we did not associate a maximum level of ebitda performance with the bonus program for fiscal 2008 we achieved a teamshare performance level of approximately 218 of the target

the bonus payable to each named executive officer if we reach the 2009 target financial performance level is equal to the applicable percentage as set forth in the chart below of such officer’s salary

 

payments for financial performance below or above the target level shall be prorated on a graduated scale commensurate with performance levels in accordance with the following schedule as a threshold matter unless required by contract no such named executive officer is eligible to receive a bonus under the 2009 teamshare program if that officer receives an “unsatisfactory” overall subjective individual performance rating and payment of any bonus is in the committee’s discretion if the named executive officer receives a “needs improvement” overall individual performance rating

executive compensation 

a 

executive compensation  we refer to the persons included in the summary compensation table below as our “named executive officers” references to “2008” “2007” and “2006” mean respectively our fiscal years ended january 30 2009 february 1 2008 and february 2 2007 references to the “merger” mean our merger discussed more fully elsewhere in this document that occurred on july 6 2007 as a result of which we became a subsidiary of buck holdings lp “buck” or “parent” a delaware limited partnership controlled by investment funds affiliated with kohlberg kravis roberts  co lp “kkr” or “sponsor” 

compensation discussion and analysis 

executive compensation philosophy and objectives 

we strive to attract retain and motivate persons with superior ability to reward outstanding performance and to align the interests of our named executive officers with the longterm interests of our shareholders the material compensation principles applicable to the 2008 compensation of our named executive officers included the following all of which are discussed in more detail in “elements of 2008 named executive officer compensation” below 

·

we generally target total compensation at the benchmarked median of our market comparator group but we make adjustments based on circumstances such as unique job descriptions and our particular niche in the retail sector that are not reflected in the market data for competitive reasons our levels of total compensation or any component of compensation may exceed the median of our comparator group

·

we set base salaries to reflect the responsibilities experience and contributions of the named executive officers and the salaries for comparable benchmarked positions subject to minimums set forth in employment agreements 

·

we reward named executive officers who enhance our performance by linking cash and equity incentives to the achievement of our financial goals 

·

we promote share ownership to align the interests of our named executive officers with those of our shareholders 

the compensation committee of our board of directors utilizes employment agreements with the named executive officers which among other things set forth minimum levels of certain compensation components the committee believes such arrangements are a common protection offered to named executive officers at comparable companies and help ensure continuity and aid in retention the agreements also provide for standard protections to both the officer and to dollar general should the officer’s employment terminate 

named executive officer compensation process 

oversight  the compensation committee of our board of directors is responsible for recommending ceo compensation to our board and for approving compensation of other named executive officers the board retains sole authority to determine ceo compensation the committee members include messrs calbert agrawal and jones

use of outside advisors  prior to the merger the former compensation committee selected hewitt associates as its compensation consultant and approved a written agreement with hewitt which describes the general terms of the working relationship hewitt remains a consultant to the company subsequent to the merger and while the written agreement with hewitt has not been formally renewed we continue to operate consistent with its terms 

the written agreement with hewitt specifies that hewitt may perform compensation consulting services upon management or committee request which services may include competitive market pay analyses support regarding legal regulatory or accounting considerations impacting compensation programs redesign of those programs assistance with market data trends and competitive practices meeting preparation and attendance and other miscellaneous work 

while the committee or any of its members may consult directly with hewitt should it or they choose to do so subsequent to the merger hewitt has directly dealt solely with mr dreiling ms challis lowe while she served as our evp of human resources and mr robert ravener since he became our svp and chief people officer ms lowe or mr ravener during the applicable time period our “senior hr officer” as well as with nonexecutive members of our human resources group both with respect to management’s work in connection with named executive officer compensation as described below under “management’s role” and in connection with general employee compensation and benefits matters our committee chairman mr calbert reviews with mr dreiling and our senior hr officer information provided by hewitt along with mr dreiling’s and our senior hr officer’s executive compensation recommendations 

management’s role  mr dreiling and the senior hr officer along with nonexecutive members of the human resources group assist hewitt in gathering and analyzing relevant competitive data and identifying and evaluating various alternatives for named executive officer compensation including their own mr dreiling and the senior hr officer regularly provide and discuss their recommendations regarding named executive officer pay components typically based on hewitt benchmarking data to the compensation committee chairman between committee meetings and to the full committee at committee meetings mr dreiling assesses named executive officer performance with mr bere’s assistance with respect to fiscal 2007 performance for purposes of determining whether each named executive officer is eligible as a threshold matter for a base salary increase and for a teamshare bonus payout in the event the relevant ebitda performance level is achieved each as discussed more fully below under “elements of 2008 named executive officer compensation” 

while the board and the committee members valued and welcomed such input from management the board and the committee ultimately made all 2008 named executive officer compensation decisions 

use of market benchmarking data  to attract and retain named executive officers who we believe will enhance our longterm business results we must pay compensation that is competitive with the external market for executive talent we believe that this primary talent market consists of retail companies with revenues and business models similar to ours because those companies have executive positions similar in breadth complexity and scope of responsibility to our named executive officer positions for 2008 hewitt provided data to management regarding total and individual compensation elements from its proprietary salary survey database and from the proxy statements of selected retail companies that met these criteria we refer to this combined group as the market comparator group in 2008 this group consisted of advance auto parts autozone big lots family dollar kohl’s limited brands 

longs drug stores nordstrom officemax payless shoe source retail ventures staples jc penney the gap macy’s blockbuster the pantry ross stores and supervalu inc hewitt was also asked to provide summary market data from all of the retail companies in their data base and from the proxy statement information for certain other significantly larger retail companies walmart target walgreen’s and cvs as additional reference points in assessing the appropriateness of the compensation levels of our named executive officers

for 2009 compensation decisions the same market comparator group of nineteen companies was used except for five companies advance auto parts kohl’s limited brands retail ventures and supervalu that discontinued their participation in the hewitt study these companies were replaced by 7eleven genuine parts mcdonald’s petsmart and yum brands which were chosen due to their relative comparability to the companies in the existing market comparator group

the committee believes that the median range of the competitive market generally is the appropriate target for a named executive officer’s total compensation and the committee takes into account the value of the named executive officer’s longterm compensation when determining the levels of the cash compensation components the committee recognizes however that it is difficult to compare equity granted by a private company to equity granted by a public company because of liquidity and other comparability issues in addition the committee does not make annual equity grants to the named executive officers as it believes that the longterm equity previously granted to the named executive officers in fiscal 2007 or at the time they were employed as applicable is sufficiently retentive and otherwise adequately meets our compensation objectives as discussed under “longterm incentive program” below 

elements of 2008 named executive officer compensation 

we provide compensation in the form of base salary shortterm cash incentives longterm equity incentives benefits and perquisites as discussed in more detail below the compensation committee believes that each of these elements is a necessary component of the compensation package and is consistent with compensation programs at competing companies 

base salary base salary generally promotes the recruiting and retention functions of our compensation principles by reflecting the salaries for comparable positions in the competitive marketplace and by providing a stable and predictable source of income for our executives the committee believes that we would be unable to attract or retain quality named executive officers in the absence of competitive base salary levels for this reason base salary constitutes a significant portion of a named executive officer’s total compensation base salary also furthers the pay for performance role of our philosophy because as a threshold matter a named executive officer is not eligible for a salary increase unless he or she achieves a satisfactory overall subjective performance evaluation 

following fiscal 2007 mr dreiling with input from mr bere subjectively assessed each named executive officer in the context of that officer’s job responsibilities and made a determination as to whether that officer’s performance for fiscal 2007 was satisfactory or unsatisfactory on an overall basis a determination of unsatisfactory performance would have 

precluded that named executive officer from receiving an increase in 2008 base salary a threshold determination of satisfactory performance did not by itself result in any variation in a named executive officer’s compensation rather satisfactory performance merely created the possibility of an increase in base salary once a named executive officer’ eligibility was established the magnitude of any salary increase was determined on the basis of benchmarking information from hewitt regarding the compensation and role of each named executive officer within our management structure in comparison to the compensation that companies in our market comparator group provide to similarly situated executives because mr dreiling determined that each such person performed satisfactorily overall as a threshold matter each named executive officer was eligible to be considered for a 2008 salary increase 

in determining each named executive officer’s 2008 base salary the compensation committee reviewed the composition of the market comparator group as described above and ms lowe informed the compensation committee of the results of the benchmarking analysis which had been discussed in detail separately with the committee’s chairman this benchmarking data showed that there was significant movement in the market median for ms guion’s position and as a result the committee adjusted her pay accordingly which resulted in an approximate 155 base salary increase the committee approved 3 base salary increases for all other named executive officers other than mr dreiling who was not considered for an increase given his recent hiring in january 2008 in order to maintain base salaries within the median range of the market comparator group

subsequent to the fiscal 2008 year end but prior to the filing of this document the compensation committee considered the 2009 base salary increases for each named executive officer mr dreiling advised the committee that he had subjectively assessed the overall performance of each named executive officer and determined that each had performed the duties and responsibilities of his or her respective position in a satisfactory manner as in prior years a determination of unsatisfactory performance would have precluded that named executive officer from receiving an increase in base salary and the threshold determination of satisfactory performance did not by itself result in any variation in compensation rather satisfactory performance merely created the possibility of an increase in base salary the magnitude of the salary increase was determined on the basis of benchmarking information from hewitt regarding data from our market comparator group

after reviewing a summary of the hewitt data the committee determined that a 225 increase in base salary for each named executive officer other than mr dreiling and ms lanigan was within the competitive median range of base salary increases within the market comparator group the benchmarking data showed that there was additional movement in the market median for ms lanigan’s position and as a result the committee adjusted her pay accordingly which resulted in an approximate 5 base salary increase all such increases are effective april 1 2009 

the committee also met with mr dreiling privately to subjectively review his performance in fiscal 2008 in the context of his job responsibilities the committee determined that mr dreiling’s fiscal 2008 performance was satisfactory on an overall basis thus also qualifying him for a 2009 base salary increase as with other named executive officers such determination did not by itself result in any variation in mr dreiling’s compensation but rather 

merely created the possibility of a base salary increase based on the same hewitt market data reviewed for the other named executive officers the committee recommended and the nonmanagement members of the board of directors approved a 121 base salary increase for mr dreiling effective april 1 2009 in order to maintain his base salary within the median range of the market comparator group

 

shortterm incentive plan our shortterm incentive plan called teamshare serves to motivate named executive officers to achieve certain preestablished objective financial goals as a threshold matter unless required by contract a named executive officer is not eligible to receive a bonus under the 2008 teamshare program if that officer receives an “unsatisfactory” overall subjective individual performance rating and payment of any bonus is in the compensation committee’s discretion if the officer receives a “needs improvement” overall individual performance rating accordingly teamshare fulfills an important part of our pay for performance philosophy while aligning the interests of our named executive officers and our shareholders teamshare also helps meet our recruiting and retention objectives by providing compensation opportunities that are consistent with those prevalent in our market comparator group

a 2008 teamshare structure  teamshare provides an opportunity for each named executive officer to receive a cash bonus payment equal to a certain percentage of base salary based upon dollar general’s achievement of a preestablished financial performance measure as it did in 2007 the compensation committee selected as the 2008 teamshare financial performance measure a measure based upon earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” with adjustments similar to those made for the purposes of calculating performance targets for our long term incentive program including exclusions for the impact of

·

any fee paid to kkr goldman sachs  co and any affiliates thereof pursuant to the terms of the monitoring fee letter agreement dated july 6 2007 

·

all consulting accounting legal valuation banking filing disclosure and similar costs fees and expenses directly related to the consideration negotiation approval and consummation of the merger and related financing and any related litigation or settlement of any related litigation and

·

any unplanned items of a nonrecurring or extraordinary nature as determined in good faith by the ceo and cfo and approved by the committee

the committee established the target financial performance level for purposes of the 2008 teamshare program at 815 million which consistent with prior practice was equal to our annual financial objective it also was similar to the fiscal 2008 level for vesting of performancebased options granted on july 6 2007 to the named executive officers the committee established the threshold financial performance level below which no bonus may be paid under the 2008 teamshare program at 95 of the target financial performance level this differed from prior practice which established the threshold level at 90 of the target level as the 

committee believed that a threshold level of 95 of target was more consistent with other companies within the kkr portfolio

 

unlike the teamshare program in prior years there was no maximum level of ebitda performance associated with the 2008 teamshare program the committee felt that setting a maximum ebitda performance level could discourage employees to strive to achieve ebitda results beyond the maximum level 

the committee considered the 2008 teamshare program target financial performance level to be challenging and generally consistent with the level of difficulty of achievement associated with the our performancebased awards for prior years we did not achieve the threshold teamshare performance level in fiscal years 2006 or 2005 we achieved teamshare performance levels between threshold and target in fiscal years 2004 and 2002 between target and maximum in fiscal year 2007 and at maximum in fiscal year 2003

the bonus payable to each named executive officer if dollar general reached the 2008 target financial performance level was equal to the applicable percentage of each officer’s salary as set forth in the chart below such payout levels which are consistent with prior years’ payout levels were selected because they are within the median range of the hewitt data for the market comparator group

 

payments for financial performance below or above the target level are prorated on a graduated scale commensurate with performance levels in accordance with the following schedule 

 

this pro ration schedule through 110 of the target ebitda performance level the prior maximum ebitda performance level is consistent with the pro ration schedule in prior years the committee determined that the pro ration schedule for ebitda performance above 110 of target should approximate a sharing between dollar general and the teamshare participants of 20 of the ebitda dollars earned above that level when calculated against the total incentive dollars that would be paid at 110 of the target ebitda performance level the incremental incentive payout equated to an additional 71491 of each named executive officer’s bonus target for each additional 1 of ebitda earned above 110 of the target level   

b 2008 teamshare results  following fiscal 2008 mr dreiling assessed each named executive officer in the context of that officer’s job responsibilities and made a subjective determination as to whether that officer’s performance for fiscal 2008 was satisfactory or unsatisfactory on an overall basis a determination of unsatisfactory performance would have precluded that named executive officer from receiving a teamshare payout for 2008 performance unless otherwise contractually provided regardless of whether we achieved our overall objective ebitda performance target for fiscal 2008 a threshold determination of satisfactory performance did not by itself result in any variation in the named executive officer’s incentive compensation rather satisfactory performance merely created the possibility of a payout under the teamshare program once a named executive officer’s eligibility was established the teamshare payout was determined based upon our objective ebitda performance because mr dreiling determined that each such person performed satisfactorily 

overall as a threshold matter each named executive officer was eligible to receive a 2008 teamshare payout to the extent we achieved the relevant ebitda performance level 

the committee also subjectively reviewed mr dreiling’s individual performance for 2008 in a manner similar to mr dreiling’s evaluations of the other named executive officers discussed above the committee determined that he had performed satisfactorily and as a threshold matter he was therefore also eligible to receive a 2008 teamshare payout to the extent we achieved the relevant ebitda performance level 

in march 2009 the compensation committee approved the ebitda performance level at 21763 of target accordingly teamshare payouts in the amount reflected in the “nonequity incentive plan compensation” column of the summary compensation table will be made to each named executive officer other than mr buley and ms lowe who are no longer employed by dollar general at the following percentages of base salary mr dreiling 21763 mr bere 17773 mr tehle 14146 ms guion 14146 and ms lanigan 14146 

c

2009 teamshare structure  as it did in 2008 the compensation committee selected as the 2009 teamshare financial performance measure a measure based upon earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” with adjustments similar to those described above pertaining to the 2008 teamshare structure the committee established the target financial performance level for purposes of the 2009 teamshare program at a level equal to our annual financial objective which was consistent with past practice the committee considers the 2009 teamshare program target financial performance level to be challenging and generally consistent with the level of difficulty of achievement associated with the our performancebased awards for prior years see “2008 teamshare structure” above for a discussion of the level of achievement in recent years of the financial performance targets 

as in 2008 and for the same reasons identified under “2008 teamshare structure” above the committee established the threshold financial performance level below which no bonus may be paid under the 2009 teamshare program at 95 of the target financial performance level and the committee did not establish a maximum level of ebitda performance under the 2009 teamshare program 

the bonus payable to each named executive officer if dollar general reaches the 2009 target financial performance level is equal to the applicable percentage of each officer’s salary as set forth in the chart below such payout levels which are consistent with prior years’ payout levels were selected because they are within the median range of the hewitt data for the market comparator group

 

payments for financial performance below or above the target level are prorated on the same graduated scale commensurate with performance levels as described under “2008 teamshare structure” above except that for every 1 ebitda increase over 110 of target each named executive officer is eligible to receive an additional 914 of his or her bonus target 

longterm incentive program longterm equity incentives motivate named executive officers to focus on longterm success for shareholders these incentives provide a balance between shortterm and longterm goals and are also important to our compensation program’s recruiting and retention objectives because most of the companies in our market comparator group offer them our longterm incentives are designed to compensate named executive officers for a longterm commitment to us while motivating sustained increases in our financial performance we believe that our longterm equity incentive program provides significant motivation and retention value to us for many reasons most notably 

·

due to limitations on transferability until the occurrence of certain liquidity events an investment in our common stock generally is illiquid while the executive remains employed by us if an executive’s employment with us terminates we may generally compel him or her to sell that stock back to us for a price determined in accordance with the management stockholder’s agreement between us and that executive

·

half of all option awards are timebased and vest over a fiveyear period provided the executive continues to be employed by us the other half are intended to be performancebased and generally require that dollar general achieve specified financial targets before those options will vest these terms are further discussed below

equity awards are made under our boardadopted and shareholderapproved 2007 stock incentive plan for key employees the “2007 plan” under the current equity award program a personal financial investment in dollar general is a prerequisite to eligibility to receive an option grant under the 2007 plan in 2007 that personal investment could be made in the form of cash rollover of stock andor rollover of inthemoney options issued prior to the merger each named executive officer other than mr dreiling who joined us in 2008 and is discussed separately below met the personal investment requirement and accordingly received option grants in 2007 under the 2007 plan because the named executive officers received options in 2007 they were not granted any further options in 2008 and are not expected to receive additional options in 2009 absent a job promotion or other special circumstance 

the options granted under the 2007 plan are divided so that half are timevested and half are performancevested based on a comparison of an ebitdabased performance metric as described below against preset goals for that performance metric the combination of time and performance based vesting of these awards is designed to compensate executives for longterm commitment to us while motivating sustained increases in our financial performance the options have an exercise price of 5 per share which was the fair market value on the grant date as determined by our board of directors 

the timevested options vest and become exercisable ratably on each of the five anniversary dates of july 6 2007 solely based upon continued employment with us over that time period the performancevested options are eligible to vest and become exercisable ratably if the board determines in good faith that we achieve specified annual performance targets based on ebitda and adjusted as described below for fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2008 that target was 700 million and 828 million respectively which targets were based on the longterm financial plan at the time of the merger and anticipated permitted adjustments primarily to account for unique expenses related to the merger if a performance target for a given fiscal year is not met the performancebased options may still vest and become exercisable on a “catch up” basis if at the end of a subsequent fiscal year through fiscal 2012 a specified cumulative ebitdabased performance target is achieved because the performance targets are based on our longterm financial plan we believe these levels while attainable require strong performance and execution

for purposes of calculating the achievement of performance targets for our longterm incentive program “ebitda” means earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization plus transaction management andor similar fees paid to kkr andor its affiliates in addition the board is required to fairly and appropriately adjust the calculation of ebitda to reflect to the extent not contemplated in our financial plan the following acquisitions divestitures any change required by generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” relating to sharebased compensation or for other changes in gaap promulgated by accounting standard setters that in each case the board in good faith determines require adjustment to the ebitda performance metric we use for our longterm incentive program adjustments to ebitda for purposes of calculating performance targets or our longterm incentive program may not in all circumstances be identical to adjustments to ebitda for other purposes including our teamshare targets and the covenants contained in our principal financial agreements accordingly comparability of such measures is limited

the specified adjusted ebitda performance targets were achieved for both fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2008

benefits and perquisites we provide benefits and limited perquisites to named executive officers for retention and recruiting purposes to promote tax efficiency for such persons and to replace benefit opportunities lost due to regulatory limits we also provide named executive officers with benefits and perquisites as additional forms of compensation that are believed to be consistent and competitive with benefits and perquisites provided to similar positions in our market comparator group and our industry most of the perquisites were established prior to the merger by the former compensation committee which believed these benefits and perquisites 

help to attract and retain executive talent along with certain benefits offered to named executive officers on the same terms that are offered to all of our salaried employees such as health and welfare benefits and matching contributions under our 401k plan we provide such persons with certain additional benefits and perquisites 

the named executive officers have the opportunity to participate in the compensation deferral plan the “cdp” and the defined contribution supplemental executive retirement plan the “serp” and together with the cdp the “cdpserp plan” our compensation committee determined in 2008 to no longer offer serp participation to persons to whom employment offers are made after may 28 2008 including newly hired executive officers 

we provide each named executive officer a life insurance benefit equal to 25 times his or her base salary up to a maximum of 3 million we pay the premiums and gross up such person’s income to pay the tax cost of this benefit we also provide each named executive officer a disability insurance benefit that provides income replacement of 60 of base salary up to a maximum monthly benefit of 20000 we pay the cost of this benefit and gross up such officer’s income to pay the tax cost of the premiums of this benefit to the extent necessary to provide benefits comparable to the group plan applicable to all salaried employees

each named executive officer may choose either a leased automobile for which we pay for gasoline repairs service and insurance or a fixed monthly automobile allowance we provide a grossup payment to pay the tax cost of the imputed income for both programs since the compensation committee believes that executive automobile programs are no longer typical in the competitive retail market the committee determined in 2008 to no longer offer an automobile lease or allowance program to persons to whom employment offers are made after may 28 2008 including newly hired executive officers and terminated the program for existing named executive officers as of july 6 2009 

we also provide a relocation assistance program to named executive officers under a policy applicable to officerlevel employees which policy is similar to that offered to certain other employees in 2008 we incurred relocation expenses for mr dreiling in accordance with this policy and his employment agreement as discussed below in “compensation of mr dreiling” and for mr bere in accordance with the policy the significant differences between the relocation assistance available to officers from the relocation assistance available to nonofficers are as follows 

·

we provide a premove allowance of 5 of the officer’s annual base salary we cap this allowance at 5000 for other employees 

·

we provide home sale assistance by offering to purchase the officer’s prior home at an independently determined appraised value in the event the prior home is not sold to an outside buyer we do not offer this service to other employees 

·

we reimburse officers for all reasonable and customary home purchase closing costs we limit our reimbursement to other employees to 2 of the purchase price to a maximum of 2500 except for loan origination fees which are limited to 1 and

·

we provide 60 days of temporary living expenses we limit temporary living expenses to 30 days for all other employees

compensation of mr dreiling 

mr dreiling entered into a fiveyear employment agreement to become ceo and a member of our board effective january 21 2008 key compensatory provisions of the agreement include

·

minimum annual base salary of 1000000

·

annual bonus payout range of 50 threshold 100 target and up to no less than 200 maximum of base salary based upon ebitda performance for 2008 mr dreiling was guaranteed to earn at least a threshold level bonus

a signing bonus of 2000000

·

equity grants consisting of 890000 shares of restricted stock and options to purchase 25 million shares of dollar general at 5 per share the fair market value on the grant date the restricted stock is scheduled to vest upon the earlier to occur of the last day of fiscal 2011 a change in control an initial public offering termination without cause or due to death or disability or resignation with good reason half of the options are timevested and the other half are performancevested these options vest upon the same terms as the other options that have been granted under the 2007 plan

·

payment of the premiums on his personal longterm disability insurance policies

·

use of our plane for mr dreiling and his spouse for up to nine trips per year between our headquarters and his second home in california

·

reimbursement and grossup for taxes of all closing costs and expenses including broker’s fees loan origination andor loan discount fees not to exceed 2 points in total and attorney fees incurred to purchase a residence in the nashville tennessee area and for up to 2 months’ lease cancellation on his apartment in the new york metropolitan area reimbursement andor payment of and grossup for taxes of temporary living expenses for 120 days as well as 2 house hunting trips not to exceed 7 nights8 days relocation also includes the payment of packing loading transporting storing and delivering his household goods including the movement of 1 car and a miscellaneous expense allowance equal to 50000 less applicable taxes

reimbursement of legal fees up to 35000 grossedup for taxes incurred in negotiating and preparing the employment agreement and documents associated with mr dreiling’s equity grants 

·

payment of monthly membership fees and costs related to his membership in professional clubs selected by him grossedup for any taxes 

mr dreiling was chosen for the ceo position after a lengthy and careful search the board firmly believes he is the right leader for the company as we move forward the terms of his employment agreement summarized above were settled after negotiation with mr dreiling 

and the board believes that they are fair and appropriate given ceo compensation and benefits at comparable companies and given mr dreiling’s experience and leadership ability these arrangements were also necessary to entice mr dreiling to resign from his previous employer and to give him the opportunity to offset the potential financial gain he would be foregoing by leaving that employer 

severance agreements 

as noted above we have an employment agreement with each of our named executive officers that among other things provide for such officer’s rights upon a termination of employment we believe that reasonable severance benefits are appropriate to protect the named executive officer against circumstances over which he or she does not have control and as consideration for the promises of noncompetition nonsolicitation and noninterference that we require in our employment agreements 

all of our severance provisions in the event of a changeincontrol operate under a double trigger requiring both a changeincontrol and a termination event except for the provisions related to longterm equity incentives under our 2007 plan under the 2007 plan 1 all timevested options will vest and become immediately exercisable as to 100 of the shares of common stock subject to such options immediately prior to a changeincontrol and 2 all performance–vested options will vest and become immediately exercisable as to 100 of the shares of common stock subject to such options immediately prior to a changeincontrol if as a result of the change–incontrol x investment funds affiliated with kkr realize a specified internal rate of return on 100 of their aggregate investment directly or indirectly in our equity securities the “sponsor shares” and y the investment funds affiliated with kkr earn a specified cash return on 100 of the sponsor shares provided however that in the event that a changeincontrol occurs in which more than 50 but less than 100 of our common stock or other voting securities or the common stock or other voting securities of buck holdings lp is sold or otherwise disposed of then the performancevested options will become vested up to the same percentage of sponsor shares on which investment funds affiliated with kkr achieve a specified internal rate of return on their aggregate investment and earn a specified return on their sponsor shares 

payments to mr buley and ms lowe in connection with employment separation 

mr buley’s and ms lowe’s employment with us ended in april 2008 and september 2008 respectively payments and other benefits to mr buley and ms lowe in connection with these employment terminations are itemized under “potential payments upon termination or changeincontrol” below and generally were in accordance with the terms of their employment agreements in recognition of her service to dollar general we transferred to ms lowe title to her companyleased automobile in connection with her separation from our employment in addition we extended health insurance coverage benefits to ms lowe and her eligible dependents from the date of her employment termination through december 31 2008 ms lowe bore the entire cost of this coverage extension

considerations associated with regulatory requirements 

section 162m of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “internal revenue code” disallows a federal income tax deduction to publicly held companies for compensation paid to specified executive officers to the extent that compensation exceeds 1 million per covered officer in any fiscal year this limitation applies only to compensation that is not considered performancebased because our common stock is not publicly traded section 162m will not limit the tax deductibility of any executive compensation for 2008 

the compensation committee administers our compensation programs with the good faith intention of complying with section 409a of the internal revenue code which relates to the taxation of nonqualified deferred compensation arrangements

other than with respect to mr buley and ms lowe the tables below reflect potential payments to each of our named executive officers in various termination and changeincontrol scenarios based on compensation benefit and equity levels in effect on january 30 2009 the amounts shown assume that the termination or changeincontrol event was effective as of january 30 2009 for stock valuations we have assumed that the price per share is the fair market value of our stock on january 30 2009 550 which was the value determined by our board of directors in good faith based upon a third party valuation as of january 30 2009 and the other factors described in footnote 4 to the table set forth under “outstanding equity awards at 2008 fiscal yearend” above  the amounts shown are merely estimates we cannot determine the actual amounts to be paid until the time of the named executive officer’s termination of employment or the time of a changeincontrol

because mr buley’s and ms lowe’s employment separations occurred prior to the end of fiscal 2008 we discuss below and the tables below present the payments they actually received in connection with such employment separations

payments regardless of manner of termination 

regardless of the termination scenario the named executive officers will receive and mr buley and ms lowe received earned but unpaid base salary through the employment termination date along with any other payments or benefits owed under any of our plans or agreements covering the named executive officer as governed by the terms of those plans or agreements these benefits include vested amounts in the cdpserp plan discussed under “nonqualified deferred compensation” above

in the event of death each named executive officer’s beneficiary will receive payments under our group life insurance program in an amount up to a maximum of 3 million equal to 25 times the named executive officer’s annual base salary we have excluded from the tables below amounts that the named executive officer would receive under our disability insurance program since the same benefit level is provided to all of our salaried employees the named executive officer’s cdpserp plan benefit also becomes fully vested to the extent not already vested upon his or her death and is payable in a lump sum within 60 days after the end of the calendar quarter in which the named executive officer’s death occurs

director independence our board of directors consists of richard dreiling michael calbert raj agrawal and adrian jones messrs calbert and agrawal serve on our audit committee and along with mr jones on our compensation committee david bere served on our board until march 2008 and dean nelson served on our board until march 2009 

though not formally considered by our board given that our securities are not registered or traded on a national securities exchange we do not believe any of our current board members or messrs bere or nelson would be considered independent under the listing standards of the new york stock exchange on which our common stock was listed prior to the merger either because of service on our management team or relationships with certain affiliates of the funds and other entities that hold significant interests in parent and other relationships with us described under “related party transactions” below accordingly we do not believe that any of our audit committee members would meet the independence requirements of rule 10a1 of the exchange act or the nyse’s audit committee independence requirements or that any of our compensation committee members would meet the nyse’s independence requirements we do not have a nominatingcorporate governance committee or a committee that serves a similar purpose

overall business strategy 

our mission is “serving others” to carry out this mission we have developed a business strategy of providing our customers with a focused assortment of everyday low priced merchandise in a convenient smallstore format 

our customers  in general we locate our stores and base our merchandise selection on the needs of households seeking value and convenience with an emphasis on rural and small markets however much of   our merchandise intended to serve the basic consumable household apparel and seasonal needs of these targeted customers also appeals to a much broader and higher income customer base 

our stores  the traditional dollar general® store has on average approximately 6900 square feet of selling space and generally serves customers who live within five miles of the store of our 8222 stores operating as of february 29 2008 more than half serve communities 

 

with populations of 20000 or less we believe that our target customers prefer the convenience of a small neighborhood store with a focused merchandise assortment at value prices our dollar general market® stores are larger than the average dollar general store having on average approximately 17000 square feet of selling space and carry among other items an expanded assortment of grocery products and perishable items as of february 29 2008 we operated 57 dollar general market stores 

our merchandise  our merchandising strategy combines a lowcost operating structure with a focused assortment of products consisting of quality basic consumable household apparel and seasonal merchandise at competitive everyday low prices our strategic combination of name brands quality private label products and other great value brands allows us to offer our customers a compelling value proposition we believe our merchandising strategy and focused assortment generate frequent repeat customer purchases and encourage customers to shop at our stores for their everyday household needs 

our prices we distribute quality consumable merchandise at everyday low prices our strategy of a lowcost operating structure and a focused assortment of merchandise allows us to offer quality merchandise at competitive prices as part of this strategy we emphasize evendollar prices on many of our items in the typical dollar general store the majority of the products are priced at 10 or less with approximately 30 of the products priced at 1 or less 

our cost controls  we aggressively manage our overhead cost structure and typically seek to locate stores in neighborhoods where rental and operating costs are relatively low our stores typically have low fixed costs with lean staffing of usually two to three employees in the store at any time in 2005 and 2006 we implemented “ezstore tm ” our initiative designed to improve inventory flow from our distribution centers or dcs to consumers ezstore has allowed us to reallocate store labor hours to more customerfocused activities improving the work content in our stores 

we also attempt to control operating costs by implementing new technology when feasible including improvements in recent years to our store labor scheduling and store replenishment systems in addition to other improvements to our supply chain and warehousing systems 

recent strategic initiatives — project alpha in 2007 we executed strategic initiatives launched in the fourth quarter of 2006 aimed at improving our merchandising and real estate strategies which we refer to collectively as “project alpha” project alpha was based upon a comprehensive analysis of the performance of each of our stores and the impact of our inventory management model on our ability to effectively serve our customers 

the execution of this merchandising initiative has moved us away from our traditional inventory packaway model where unsold seasonal apparel and home products inventory items were stored onsite and returned to the sales floor to be sold year after year until the items were eventually sold damaged or discarded project alpha is an attempt to better meet our customers’ needs and to ensure an appealing fresh merchandise selection in connection with this initiative in fiscal 2007 we began taking endofseason markdowns on currentyear nonreplenishable 

 

merchandise with limited and planned exceptions we eliminated through endofseason and other markdowns our seasonal home products and basic clothing packaway merchandise and out of season current year merchandise by the end of fiscal 2007 in addition to allowing us to carry newer fresher merchandise particularly in our seasonal apparel and home categories we believe this strategy change has enhanced the appearance of our stores and will continue to positively impact customer satisfaction as well as our store employees’ ability to manage stores 

project alpha also encompassed significant improvements to our real estate practices we are fully integrating the functions of site selection lease renewals relocations remodels and store closings and have defined and are implementing rigorous analytical processes for decisionmaking in those areas as a first step in our initiative to revitalize our store base we performed a comprehensive real estate review resulting in the identification of approximately 400 underperforming stores all of which we closed by mid2007 these closings were in addition to stores that are typically closed in the normal course of business which over the last 10 years constituted approximately 1 to 2 of our store base per year we believe our rate of store closings should return to historic levels in 2008 and future years while we believe we have significant opportunities for future store growth we have moderated our new store growth rate to enable us to focus on improving the performance of existing stores those efforts include increasing the number of store remodels and relocations in order to improve productivity and enhance the shopping experience for our customers 

as a result of opening new stores and remodeling existing stores as of february 29 2008 over 1000 stores are operating in our racetrack format which is designed with improved merchandise adjacencies and wider more open aisles to enhance the overall guest shopping experience we plan to continue to enhance this new store layout to further drive sales growth and margin enhancements through improved merchandising 

our industry 

we compete in the deep discount segment of the us retail industry our competitors include traditional “dollar stores” as well as other retailers offering discounted convenience items the “dollar store” sector differentiates itself from other forms of retailing in the deep discount segment by offering consistently low prices in a convenient smallstore format unlike other formats that have suffered with the rise of walmart and other discount supercenters the “dollar store” sector has grown despite the presence of the discount supercenters we believe it is our substantial convenience advantage at prices comparable to those of supercenters that allows dollar general to compete so effectively 

 

we believe that there is considerable room for growth in the “dollar store” sector according to ac nielsen “dollar stores” have been able to increase their penetration across all income brackets in the last 6 years though traditional “dollar stores” have high customer penetration according to information resources inc “iri” the sector as a whole accounts for only approximately 12 of total consumer product goods spending which we believe leaves ample room for growth our merchandising initiatives are aimed at increasing our stores’ share of customer spending 

see “our competitive strengths” and “competition” below for additional information regarding our competitive situation 

our competitive strengths 

market leader in an attractive sector with a growing customer base we are the largest discount retailer in the us by number of stores with 8222 stores in 35 states as of february 29 2008 we are the largest player in the us small box deep discount segment with sales in excess of 14 times that of our nearest competitor in 2007 we believe we are well positioned to further increase our market share as we continue to execute our business strategy and implement our operational initiatives our target customers are those seeking value and convenience according to nielsen media research as of mid2007 approximately 64 of households shopped at least once at a discount store up from 59 in 2001 

consistent sales growth and strong cash flow generation for 18 consecutive years we have experienced positive annual same store sales growth approximately twothirds of our net sales come from the sale of consumable products which are less susceptible to economic pressures such as increased fuel costs and unemployment with the remaining onethird comprised mainly of seasonal basic clothing and home products which are subject to little trend or fashion risk we have a low cost operating model with attractive operating margins low capital expenditures and low working capital needs resulting in generation of significant cash flow from operations before interest 

differentiated value proposition our ability to deliver highly competitive everyday low prices in a convenient location and shopping format provides our customers with a compelling shopping experience and distinguishes us from other discount retailers as well as convenience and drugstore retailers 

compelling unit economics the traditional dollar general store size design and location requires an initial investment of approximately 250000 including inventory the low initial investment and maintenance capital expenditures when combined with strong average unit volumes provide for a quick recovery of store startup costs the ability of our stores to generate strong cash flows with minimal investment results in a short payback period 

efficient supply chain we believe our distribution network is an integral component of our efforts to reduce transportation expenses and effectively support our growth in recent years we have made significant investments in technological improvements and upgrades which have increased our efficiency and capacity to support our merchandising and operations initiatives as well as future store growth 

experienced and motivated management team in january 2008 we hired richard dreiling who has 38 years of retail experience to serve as our chief executive officer over the past two years we strengthened our management team with the hiring of david beré our president and chief operating officer we also replaced a majority of our senior merchandising and real estate teams in connection with the merger we entered into agreements with certain 

 

members of management pursuant to which they elected to invest in dollar general in an aggregate amount of approximately 104 million 

seasonality 

our business is seasonal to a certain extent generally our highest sales volume occurs in the fourth quarter which includes the christmas selling season and the lowest occurs in the first quarter in addition our quarterly results can be affected by the timing of new store openings and store closings the amount of sales contributed by new and existing stores as well as the timing of certain holidays we purchase substantial amounts of inventory in the third quarter and incur higher shipping costs and higher payroll costs in anticipation of the increased sales activity during the fourth quarter in addition we carry merchandise during our fourth quarter that we do not carry during the rest of the year such as gift sets holiday decorations certain baking items and a broader assortment of toys and candy 

the following table reflects the seasonality of net sales gross profit and net income loss by quarter for each of the quarters of the current fiscal year as well as each of the quarters of the two most recent fiscal years all of the quarters reflected below are comprised of 13 weeks with the exception of the fourth quarter of our fiscal year ended february 3 2006 which was comprised of 14 weeks 

 

 

 

 

merchandise 

we separate our merchandise into the following four categories for reporting purposes highly consumable seasonal home products and basic clothing highly consumable consists of packaged food candy snacks and refrigerated products health and beauty aids home cleaning supplies and pet supplies seasonal consists of seasonal and other holidayrelated items toys stationery and hardware and home products consists of housewares and domestics  the percentage of net sales of each of our four categories of merchandise for the period indicated below was as follows 

 

our home products and seasonal categories typically account for the highest gross profit margin and the highly consumable category typically accounts for the lowest gross profit margin 

we currently maintain approximately 5400 core stockkeeping units or skus per store and an additional 3000 noncore skus that get rotated in and out of the store over the course of a year in 2007 we reduced the number of noncore skus 

we purchase our merchandise from a wide variety of suppliers approximately 12 of our purchases in 2007 were from the procter  gamble company our next largest supplier accounted for approximately 6 of our purchases in 2007 we directly imported approximately 9 of our purchases at cost 15 at retail in 2007 

the dollar general store 

the average dollar general store has approximately 6900 square feet of selling space and is typically operated by a manager an assistant manager and two or more sales clerks approximately 47 of our stores are located in strip shopping centers 51 are in freestanding buildings and 2 are in downtown buildings we attempt to locate primarily in small towns or in neighborhoods of more densely populated areas where occupancy expenses are relatively low 

we generally have not encountered difficulty locating suitable store sites in the past and management does not currently anticipate experiencing material difficulty in finding future suitable locations 

 

our recent store growth is summarized in the following table

 

 

 

 

 

employees 

as of february 29 2008 we employed approximately 71500 fulltime and parttime employees including divisional and regional managers district managers store managers and dc and administrative personnel management believes our relationship with our employees is generally good and we currently are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements 

competition 

we operate in the discount retail merchandise business which is highly competitive with respect to price store location merchandise quality assortment and presentation instock consistency and customer service we compete with discount stores and with many other retailers including mass merchandise grocery drug convenience variety and other specialty stores these other retail companies operate stores in many of the areas where we operate and many of them engage in extensive advertising and marketing efforts our direct competitors in the dollar store retail category include family dollar dollar tree fred’s 99 cents only and various local independent operators competitors from other retail categories include walmart walgreens cvs rite aid target and costco among others certain of our competitors have greater financial distribution marketing and other resources than we do 

the dollar store category differentiates itself from other forms of retailing by offering consistently low prices in a convenient smallstore format we believe that our prices are competitive due in part to our low cost operating structure and the relatively limited assortment of products offered historically we have minimized labor by offering fewer price points and a reliance on simple merchandise presentation we maintain strong purchasing power due to our leadership position in the dollar store retail category and our focused assortment of merchandise 

trademarks 

through our subsidiary dollar general merchandising inc we own marks that are registered with the united states patent and trademark office including the trademarks dollar general® dollar general market® clover valley® american value® dg guarantee® and the dollar general price point designs along with certain other trademarks we attempt to obtain registration of our trademarks whenever practicable and to pursue vigorously any infringement of those marks our trademark registrations have various expiration dates however assuming that the trademark registrations are properly renewed they have a perpetual duration

 item 1a risk factors tableend 

 

investing in our securities involves a degree of risk persons buying our securities should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information contained in this report and other filings that we make from time to time with the sec including our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations in addition the risks described below are not the only risks facing us additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or those we currently view to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations in any such case the trading price of our securities could decline or we may not be able to make payments of principal and interest on our outstanding notes and you may lose all or part of your original investment 

the fact that we have substantial debt could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting our obligations under our outstanding debt securities 

we have substantial debt which could have important consequences including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition the borrowings under our new credit facilities bear interest at variable rates and other debt we incur also could be variablerate debt if market interest rates increase variablerate debt will create higher debt service requirements which could adversely affect our cash flow while we have and may in the future enter into agreements limiting our exposure to higher interest rates any such agreements may not offer complete protection from this risk we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future subject to the restrictions contained in our new credit facilities and the indentures governing our debt securities if new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels the related risks that we now face could intensify 

our debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business 

our new credit facilities and the indentures governing our debt securities contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions these covenants limit our and our restricted subsidiaries’ ability to among other things 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the agreement governing such indebtedness upon our failure to maintain compliance with these covenants the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit thereunder if the lenders under such indebtedness accelerate the repayment of borrowings we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay those borrowings as well as our other indebtedness including our outstanding debt securities we have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral under our new credit facilities if we were unable to repay those amounts the lenders under our new credit facilities could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness additional borrowings under the abl facility will if excess availability under 

 

that facility is less than a certain amount be subject to the satisfaction of a specified financial ratio our ability to meet this financial ratio can be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot assure you that we will meet this ratio and other covenants 

general economic factors may adversely affect our financial performance 

general economic conditions in one or more of the markets we serve may adversely affect our financial performance a general slowdown in the economy higher interest rates higher than expected fuel and other energy costs inflation higher levels of unemployment higher consumer debt levels higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws tightening of the credit markets and other economic factors could adversely affect consumer demand for the products we sell change our sales mix of products to one with a lower average gross profit and result in slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns on inventory higher interest rates higher commodities rates higher fuel and other energy costs transportation costs inflation higher costs of labor insurance and healthcare foreign exchange rate fluctuations higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws changes in other laws and regulations and other economic factors increase our cost of sales and selling general and administrative expenses and otherwise adversely affect the operations and operating results of our stores 

our plans depend significantly on initiatives designed to improve the efficiencies costs and effectiveness of our operations and failure to achieve or sustain these plans could affect our performance adversely 

we have had and expect to continue to have initiatives such as those relating to marketing merchandising promotions sourcing shrink private label store operations and real estate in various stages of testing evaluation and implementation upon which we expect to rely to improve our results of operations and financial condition these initiatives are inherently risky and uncertain even when tested successfully in their application to our business in general it is possible that successful testing can result partially from resources and attention that cannot be duplicated in broader implementation testing and general implementation also can be affected by other risk factors described herein that reduce the results expected successful systemwide implementation relies on consistency of training stability of workforce ease of execution and the absence of offsetting factors that can influence results adversely failure to achieve successful implementation of our initiatives or the cost of these initiatives exceeding management’s estimates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

because our business is seasonal to a certain extent with the highest volume of net sales during the fourth quarter adverse events during the fourth quarter could materially affect our financial statements as a whole 

we generally recognize our highest volume of net sales during the christmas selling season which occurs in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year in anticipation of this holiday we purchase substantial amounts of seasonal inventory and hire many temporary employees a seasonal merchandise inventory imbalance could result if for any reason our net sales during the christmas selling season were to fall below either seasonal norms or expectations if for any reason our fourth quarter results were substantially below expectations our financial 

 

performance and operating results could be adversely affected by unanticipated markdowns especially in seasonal merchandise lower than anticipated sales in the christmas selling season would also negatively affect our ability to absorb the increased seasonal labor costs 

we face intense competition that could limit our growth opportunities and adversely impact our financial performance 

the retail business is highly competitive we operate in the discount retail merchandise business which is highly competitive with respect to price store location merchandise quality assortment and presentation instock consistency and customer service this competitive environment subjects us to the risk of adverse impact to our financial performance because of the lower prices and thus the lower margins required to maintain our competitive position also companies operating in the discount retail merchandise sector due to customer demographics and other factors may have limited ability to increase prices in response to increased costs including vendor price increases this limitation may adversely affect our margins and financial performance we compete for customers employees store sites products and services and in other important aspects of our business with many other local regional and national retailers we compete with retailers operating discount mass merchandise grocery drug convenience variety and other specialty stores certain of our competitors have greater financial distribution marketing and other resources than we do these other competitors compete in a variety of ways including aggressive promotional activities merchandise selection and availability services offered to customers location store hours instore amenities and price if we fail to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets it could adversely affect our financial performance see “business—our industry —competitive strengths and —competition” for additional discussion of our competitive situation 

competition for customers has intensified in recent years as larger competitors have moved into or increased their presence in our geographic markets we remain vulnerable to the marketing power and high level of consumer recognition of these larger competitors and to the risk that these competitors or others could venture into the “dollar store” industry in a significant way generally we expect an increase in competition 

natural disasters unusually adverse weather conditions pandemic outbreaks boycotts and geopolitical events could adversely affect our financial performance 

  

the occurrence of one or more natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes unusually adverse weather conditions pandemic outbreaks boycotts and geopolitical events such as civil unrest in countries in which our suppliers are located and acts of terrorism or similar disruptions could adversely affect our operations and financial performance these events could result in physical damage to one or more of our properties increases in fuel or other energy prices the temporary or permanent closure of one or more of our stores or distribution centers delays in opening new stores the temporary lack of an adequate work force in a market the temporary or longterm disruption in the supply of products from some local and overseas suppliers the temporary disruption in the transport of goods from overseas delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution centers or stores the temporary reduction in the availability of products in our stores and disruption to our information systems these events also can have 

 

indirect consequences such as increases in the costs of insurance following a destructive hurricane season these factors could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations and financial performance 

risks associated with the domestic and foreign suppliers from whom our products are sourced could adversely affect our financial performance 

  

the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers approximately 12 of our purchases in 2007 were from the procter  gamble company our next largest supplier accounted for approximately 6 of our purchases in 2007 we directly imported approximately 9 of our purchases at cost in 2007 but many of our domestic vendors directly import their products or components of their products political and economic instability in the countries in which foreign suppliers are located the financial instability of suppliers suppliers’ failure to meet our supplier standards labor problems experienced by our suppliers the availability of raw materials to suppliers merchandise quality or safety issues currency exchange rates transport availability and cost inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located or from which they import are beyond our control in addition the united states’ foreign trade policies tariffs and other impositions on imported goods trade sanctions imposed on certain countries the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control disruptions due to labor stoppages strikes or slowdowns or other disruptions involving our vendors or the transportation and handling industries also may negatively affect our ability to receive merchandise and thus may negatively affect sales these and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our financial performance in addition our ability to obtain indemnification from foreign suppliers may be hindered by the manufacturers’ lack of understanding of us product liability or other laws which may make it more likely that we may be required to respond to claims or complaints from customers as if we were the manufacturer of the products as we increase our imports of merchandise from foreign vendors the risks associated with foreign imports will increase 

we are dependent on attracting and retaining qualified employees while also controlling labor costs 

our future performance depends on our ability to attract retain and motivate qualified employees many of these employees are in entrylevel or parttime positions with historically high rates of turnover availability of personnel varies widely from location to location our ability to meet our labor needs generally including our ability to find qualified personnel to fill positions that become vacant at our existing stores and distribution centers while controlling our labor costs is subject to numerous external factors including the level of competition for such personnel in a given market the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force of the markets in which we are located unemployment levels within those markets prevailing wage rates and changes in minimum wage laws changing demographics health and other insurance costs and changes in employment legislation increased turnover also can have significant indirect costs including more recruiting and training needs store disruptions due to management changeover and potential delays in new store openings or adverse customer 

 

reactions to inadequate customer service levels due to personnel shortages competition for qualified employees exerts upward pressure on wages paid to attract such personnel in addition to the extent a significant portion of our employee base unionizes or attempts to unionize our labor costs could increase our ability to pass along those costs is constrained 

also our stores are decentralized and are managed through a network of geographically dispersed management personnel our inability to effectively and efficiently operate our stores including the ability to control losses resulting from inventory and cash shrinkage may negatively affect our sales andor operating margins 

our planned future growth will be impeded which would adversely affect sales if we cannot open new stores on schedule or if we close a number of stores materially in excess of anticipated levels 

our growth is dependent on both increases in sales in existing stores and the ability to open new stores our ability to timely open new stores and to expand into additional market areas depends in part on the following factors the availability of attractive store locations the absence of occupancy delays the ability to negotiate favorable lease terms the ability to hire and train new personnel especially store managers the ability to identify customer demand in different geographic areas general economic conditions and the availability of sufficient funds for expansion in addition many of these factors affect our ability to successfully relocate stores many of these factors are beyond our control in addition our substantial debt particularly combined with the recent tightening of the credit markets has made it more difficult for our real estate developers to obtain loans for our buildtosuit stores and to locate investors for those properties after they have been developed if this trend continues it could materially adversely impact our ability to open buildtosuit stores in desirable locations 

delays or failures in opening new stores or achieving lower than expected sales in new stores or drawing a greater than expected proportion of sales in new stores from existing stores could materially adversely affect our growth in addition we may not anticipate all of the challenges imposed by the expansion of our operations and as a result may not meet our targets for opening new stores or expanding profitably 

some of our new stores may be located in areas where we have little or no meaningful experience those markets may have different competitive conditions market conditions consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns than our existing markets which may cause our new stores to be less successful than stores in our existing markets 

some of our new stores will be located in areas where we have existing units although we have experience in these markets increasing the number of locations in these markets may cause us to oversaturate markets and temporarily or permanently divert customers and sales from our existing stores thereby adversely affecting our overall financial performance 

we are dependent upon the smooth functioning of our distribution network the capacity of our distribution centers and the timely receipt of inventory 

 

we rely upon the ability to replenish depleted inventory through deliveries to our distribution centers from vendors and from the distribution centers to our stores by various means of transportation including shipments by sea and truck labor shortages in the transportation industry andor labor inefficiencies associated with certain “driver hours of service” regulations adopted by the federal motor carriers safety administration could negatively affect transportation costs in addition longterm disruptions to the national and international transportation infrastructure that lead to delays or interruptions of service would adversely affect our business 

the efficient operation of our business is heavily dependent upon our information systems 

we depend on a variety of information technology systems for the efficient functioning of our business we rely on certain software vendors to maintain and periodically upgrade many of these systems so that they can continue to support our business the software programs supporting many of our systems were licensed to us by independent software developers the inability of these developers or us to continue to maintain and upgrade these information systems and software programs would disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations if we were unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner in addition costs and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology or with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems could also disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations we also rely heavily on our information technology staff if we cannot meet our staffing needs in this area we may not be able to fulfill our technology initiatives while continuing to provide maintenance on existing systems 

we are subject to governmental regulations procedures and requirements a significant change in or noncompliance with these regulations could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance 

our business is subject to numerous federal state and local regulations changes in these regulations particularly those governing the sale of products may require extensive system and operating changes that may be difficult to implement and could increase our cost of doing business untimely compliance or noncompliance with applicable regulations or untimely or incomplete execution of a required product recall can result in the imposition of penalties including loss of licenses or significant fines or monetary penalties in addition to reputational damage 

our current insurance program may expose us to unexpected costs and negatively affect our financial performance 

historically our insurance coverage has reflected deductibles selfinsured retentions limits of liability and similar provisions that we believe are prudent based on the dispersion of our operations however there are types of losses we may incur but against which we cannot be insured or which we believe are not economically reasonable to insure such as losses due to acts of war employee and certain other crime and some natural disasters if we incur these losses our business could suffer certain material events may result in sizable losses for the insurance industry and adversely impact the availability of adequate insurance coverage or result in 

 

excessive premium increases to offset negative insurance market trends we may elect to selfinsure accept higher deductibles or reduce the amount of coverage in response to these market changes in addition we selfinsure a significant portion of expected losses under our workers’ compensation automobile liability general liability and group health insurance programs unanticipated changes in any applicable actuarial assumptions and management estimates underlying our recorded liabilities for these losses including expected increases in medical and indemnity costs could result in materially different amounts of expense than expected under these programs which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations although we continue to maintain property insurance for catastrophic events we are effectively selfinsured for losses up to the amount of our deductibles if we experience a greater number of these losses than we anticipate our financial performance could be adversely affected 

litigation may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business is subject to the risk of litigation by employees consumers suppliers shareholders government agencies or others through private actions class actions administrative proceedings regulatory actions or other litigation the outcome of litigation particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions is difficult to assess or quantify plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to these lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time in addition certain of these lawsuits if decided adversely to us or settled by us may result in liability material to our financial statements as a whole or may negatively affect our operating results if changes to our business operation are required the cost to defend future litigation may be significant there also may be adverse publicity associated with litigation that could negatively affect customer perception of our business regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable as a result litigation may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations see part i item 3 “legal proceedings” for further details regarding certain of these pending matters 

in addition from time to time third parties may claim that our trademarks or product offerings infringe upon their proprietary rights any such claim whether or not it has merit could be timeconsuming and distracting for executive management result in costly litigation cause changes to our private label offerings or delays in introducing new private label offerings or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements as a result any such claim could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

the investors control us and may have conflicts of interest with us now or in the future 

the investors indirectly own through their investment in parent a substantial portion of our common stock as a result the investors have control over our decisions to enter into any corporate transaction and have the ability to prevent any transaction that requires the approval of shareholders regardless of whether others believe that any such transactions are in our own best interests for example the investors could cause us to make acquisitions that increase the amount of indebtedness that is secured or that is senior to our outstanding debt securities or 

 

to sell assets which may impair our ability to make payments under our outstanding debt securities 

additionally the investors are in the business of making investments in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us the investors may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and as a result those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us so long as the investors or other funds controlled by or associated with the investors continue to indirectly own a significant amount of the outstanding shares of our common stock even if such amount is less than 50 the investors will continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control our decisions

executive overview 

we are the largest discount retailer in the united states by number of stores with approximately 8200 stores located in 35 states primarily in the southern southwestern midwestern and eastern united states we serve a broad customer base and offer a focused assortment of everyday items including basic consumable merchandise and other home apparel and seasonal products a majority of our products are priced at 10 or less and approximately 30 of our products are priced at 1 or less we seek to offer a compelling value proposition for our customers based on convenient store locations easy in and out shopping and quality merchandise at highly competitive prices we believe our combination of value and convenience distinguishes us from other discount convenience and drugstore retailers who typically focus on either value or convenience 

the nature of our business is seasonal to a certain extent primarily because of sales of holidayrelated merchandise sales in the fourth quarter have historically been higher than sales achieved in each of the first three quarters of the fiscal year expenses and to a greater extent operating income vary by quarter results of a period shorter than a full year may not be indicative of results expected for the entire year furthermore the seasonal nature of our business may affect comparisons between periods 

in november 2006 we completed a strategic review of our inventory and real estate strategies and announced significant changes to existing company practices which we refer to as “project alpha” at that time we announced our decision to close 403 stores which did not meet our recently developed store criteria in addition to stores closed in the ordinary course of business and to slow our new store growth rate we made this decision to allow ourselves to focus on our merchandising efforts and improvements to our execution in the stores at that time we also announced the decision to eliminate with limited exceptions our “packaway” inventory strategy which was our historical practice of storing unsold merchandise at the end of a season and carrying it over to the following year all of the 403 stores identified for closing were closed by the end of july 2007 and all of our packaway inventory was eliminated by the end of the 2007 fiscal year we believe that the elimination of packaway inventory coupled with the completion in 2006 of the implementation of our ezstore tm process simplifying the way we stock new merchandise in our stores contributed to our ability to show significant improvements in the shopability and manageability of our stores in 2007 we believe these initiatives also led to our successful reduction of store employee turnover in 2007 including significant improvement at the critical store manager and district manager levels 

in addition to the initiatives noted above during 2007 we worked closely with kkr to refine our strategic initiatives and set goals to improve our operational and financial performance during this transition we slowed our store growth as planned and we defined very specific operational and financial benchmarks to monitor and measure our progress against our goals specifically in 2007 we focused on and made good progress on improving our merchandising and category management processes refining our real estate processes and improving our distribution and transportation logistics in addition we accelerated our efforts to refine our pricing strategy increase direct foreign sourcing and expand our private label offering all of these initiatives are ongoing and we continue to expect them to positively impact our gross profit sales productivity and capital efficiency in 2008 and beyond 

it is important for you to read our more detailed discussion of financial and operating results below under “results of operations” basis points or bps amounts referred to below are equal to 001 percent as a percentage of sales some of the more significant highlights of the 2007 fiscal year are as follows 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we made significant progress on our merchandising and operating initiatives in 2007 including clearing our stores of packaway inventories and closing our lowperforming stores giving us a strong foundation for further enhancements in 2008 these changes also contributed to a decrease in employee turnover and a dramatic improvement in the overall appearance of our stores we moved forward with our pricing and private label initiatives and enhanced our merchandising analysis tools giving us a better platform for decisionmaking we accomplished these goals while making a significant transition in the financial structure of the company 

2008 priorities  in 2008 under the leadership of our new ceo we plan to continue to deliver value to our customers through our ability to deliver highly competitive prices in a convenient shopping format our stores provide our customers with a compelling shopping experience low everyday prices on name brand and other quality items in a convenient easytoshop format we plan to continue to improve on this valueconvenience model by implementing merchandising and operational improvements 

we are focused on further improving financial performance through 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition we plan to open approximately 200 new stores and to remodel or relocate approximately 400 stores 

key financial metrics  we have identified the following as our most critical financial metrics for 2008 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

readers should refer to the detailed discussion of our operating results below for additional comments on financial performance in the current year periods as compared with the prior year periods 

 

results of operations 

the following discussion of our financial performance is based on the consolidated financial statements set forth herein the following table contains results of operations data for the 2007 2006 and 2005 fiscal years and the dollar and percentage variances among those years 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

net sales  net sales increased 3254 million or 35 in 2007 primarily representing a samestore sales increase of 21 for 2007 compared to 2006 samestore sales include stores that have been open for 13 months and remain open at the end of the reporting period the increase in samestore sales accounted for 1856 million of the increase in sales sales resulting from new store growth including 365 new stores in 2007 were partially offset by the impact of store closings in 2007 and 2006 increased sales of highly consumables accounted for 2948 million of our total sales increase resulting from successful changes over the past year to our consumables merchandising mix sales of seasonal merchandise and apparel increased slightly and were partially offset by a decrease in home products sales to some extent sales in these more discretionary categories were impacted by our efforts to eliminate our packaway strategy by the end of 2007 and to reduce overall inventory levels in addition we believe sales of seasonal merchandise apparel and home products were negatively affected by continued economic pressures on our customers particularly in the fourth quarter the increase in samestore sales represents an increase in average customer purchase offset by a slight decrease in customer traffic 

increases in 2006 net sales resulted primarily from opening additional stores including 300 net new stores in 2006 and a samestore sales increase of 33 for 2006 compared to 2005 the increase in samestore sales accounted for 2654 million of the increase in sales while new stores were the primary contributors to the remaining 3222 million sales increase during 2006 the increase in samestore sales is primarily attributable to an increase in average customer purchase we also believe that the strategic merchandising and real estate initiatives discussed above in the “executive overview” had a positive impact on net sales in the fourth quarter by merchandise category our sales increase in 2006 compared to 2005 was primarily attributable to the highly consumable category which increased by 4155 million or 74 an increase in sales of seasonal merchandise of 1612 million or 120 also contributed to overall sales growth we believe that our increased sales in 2006 were supported by additions to our product offerings and increased promotional activities including the use of advertising circulars and clearance activities 

as discussed above we monitor our sales internally by the following four major categories highly consumable seasonal home products and basic clothing the highly consumable category has a lower gross profit rate than the other three categories and has grown significantly over the past several years we expect the move away from our packaway inventory strategy to have a positive impact on sales in our nonconsumable merchandise categories because of the impact of sales mix on gross profit we continually review our merchandise mix and strive to adjust it when appropriate maintaining an appropriate sales mix is an integral part of achieving our gross profit and sales goals 

gross profit  the gross profit rate increased by 201 basis points in 2007 as compared with 2006 due to a number of factors including an increase in purchase markups resulting primarily from a change in mix of items and higher vendor rebates lower markdowns including markdowns from retail and below cost markdowns as discussed below markdowns in 2006 included significant markdowns and below cost adjustments relating to the initial launch of project alpha and improved leverage on distribution and transportation costs driven by 

logistics efficiencies offsetting the factors listed above was an increase in our shrink rate in 2007 as compared to 2006 

the gross profit rate decline in 2006 as compared with 2005 was due primarily to a significant increase in markdown activity as a percentage of sales including belowcost markdowns as a result of our inventory liquidation and store closing initiatives while we believe these initiatives had a positive impact on sales they had a negative impact on our gross profit rate in 2006 in total our gross profit rate declined by 289 basis points to 258 in 2006 compared to 287 in 2005 significantly impacting our gross profit rate as a result of the related effect on cost of goods sold were total markdowns of 2791 million at cost taken during 2006 compared with total markdowns of 1065 million at cost taken in 2005 the 2006 markdowns reflect 1799 million at cost taken during the fourth quarter of 2006 compared to 390 million markdowns at cost taken during the fourth quarter of 2005 other factors included but were not limited to a decrease in the markups on purchases primarily attributable to purchases of highly consumable products including nationally branded products which generally have lower average markups and an increase in our shrink rate 

selling general and administrative “sga” expense  sga expense increased 1655 million or 78 in 2007 from the prior year and increased as a percentage of sales to 241 in 2007 from 231 in 2006 sga in 2007 includes 234 million related to amortization of leasehold intangibles capitalized in connection with the revaluation of assets at the date of the merger 272 million of accrued administrative employee incentive compensation expense resulting from meeting certain financial targets compared to 96 million of discretionary bonuses in 2006 approximately 54 million of expenses relating to the closing of stores and the elimination of our packaway inventory strategy compared to approximately 33 million in 2006 and an accrued loss of approximately 120 million relating to the probable restructuring of certain distribution center leases in addition sga in 2007 includes approximately 48 million of kkrrelated consulting and monitoring fees sga expense in 2006 was partially offset by insurance proceeds of 130 million received during the year related to losses incurred due to hurricane katrina 

the increase in sga expense as a percentage of sales in 2006 as compared with 2005 was due to a number of factors including increases in the following expense categories impairment charges on leasehold improvements and store fixtures totaling 94 million including 80 million related to the planned closings of approximately 400 underperforming stores 128 of which closed in 2006 and the remainder of which closed in 2007 lease contract terminations totaling 57 million related to these stores higher store occupancy costs increased 121 due to higher average monthly rentals associated with our leased store locations higher debit and credit card fees increased 406 due to the increased customer usage of debit cards and the acceptance of visa credit and check cards at all locations higher administrative labor costs increased 299 primarily related to additions to our executive team particularly in merchandising and real estate and the expensing of stock options higher advertising costs increased 1983 related primarily to the distribution of several advertising circulars in the year and to promotional activities related to the inventory clearance and store closing activities discussed above and higher incentive compensation primarily related to the 96 million discretionary bonus authorized by the board of directors for the 2006 fiscal year these 

increases were partially offset by insurance proceeds of 130 million received during the period related to losses incurred due to hurricane katrina and depreciation and amortization expenses that remained relatively constant in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 

transaction and related costs the 1026 million of expenses recorded in 2007 reflect 632 million of expenses related to the merger such as investment banking and legal fees as well as 394 million of compensation expense related to stock options restricted stock and restricted stock units which were fully vested immediately prior to the merger 

interest income interest income in 2007 consists primarily of interest on shortterm investments the increase in 2007 from 2006 resulted from higher levels of cash and short term investments on hand primarily in the first half of the year the decrease in 2006 compared to 2005 was due primarily to the acquisition of the entity which held legal title to the south boston distribution center in june 2006 and the related elimination of the note receivable which represented debt issued by this entity from which we formerly leased the south boston distribution center 

interest expense  interest expense increased by 2283 million in 2007 as compared to 2006 due to interest on longterm obligations incurred to finance the merger see further discussion under “liquidity and capital resources” below we had outstanding variablerate debt of 7870 million after taking into consideration the impact of interest rate swaps as of february 1 2008 the remainder of our outstanding indebtedness at february 1 2008 was fixed rate debt

the increase in interest expense in 2006 was primarily attributable to increased interest expense of 65 million under a revolving credit agreement primarily due to increased borrowings an increase in taxrelated interest of 41 million offset by a reduction in interest expense associated with the elimination of a financing obligation on the south boston distribution center 

loss on interest rate swaps during 2007 we recorded an unrealized loss of 41 million related to the change in the fair value of interest swaps prior to the designation of such swaps as cash flow hedges in october 2007 this loss is offset by earnings of 17 million under the contractual provisions of the swap agreements 

loss on debt retirements net during 2007 we recorded 62 million of expenses related to consent fees and other costs associated with a tender offer for certain notes payable maturing in june 2010 “2010 notes” approximately 99 of the 2010 notes were retired as a result of the tender offer the costs related to the tender of the 2010 notes were partially offset by a 49 million gain resulting from the repurchase of 250 million of our 1187512625 senior subordinated notes due july 15 2017 

income taxes  the effective income tax rates for the successor period ended february 1 2008 and the predecessor periods ended july 6 2007 2006 and 2005 were a benefit of 269 and expense of 3002 374 and 357 respectively 

the income tax rate for the successor period ended february 1 2008 is a benefit of 269 this benefit is less than the expected us statutory rate of 35 due to the incurrence of state income taxes in several of the group’s subsidiaries that file their state income tax returns on a separate entity basis and the election to include effective february 3 2007 income tax related interest and penalties in the amount reported as income tax expense 

 

the income tax rate for the predecessor period ended july 6 2007 is an expense of 3002 this expense is higher than the expected us statutory rate of 35 due principally to the nondeductibility of certain acquisition related expenses 

 

the 2006 income tax rate was higher than the 2005 rate by 17 factors contributing to this increase include additional expense related to the adoption of a new tax system in the state of texas a reduction in the contingent income tax reserve due to the resolution of contingent liabilities that is less than the decrease that occurred in 2005 an increase in the deferred tax valuation allowance and an increase related to a nonrecurring benefit recognized in 2005 related to an internal restructuring offsetting these rate increases was a reduction in the income tax rate related to federal income tax credits due to the reduction in our 2006 income before tax a small increase in the amount of federal income tax credits earned yielded a much larger percentage reduction in the income tax rate for 2006 versus 2005 

 

effects of inflation 

we believe that inflation andor deflation had a minimal impact on our overall operations during 2007 2006 and 2005 

liquidity and capital resources 

current financial condition  recent developments  during the past three years we have generated an aggregate of approximately 14 billion in cash flows from operating activities during that period we expanded the number of stores we operate by approximately 12 874 stores and incurred approximately 685 million in capital expenditures as noted above we made certain strategic decisions which slowed our growth in 2007 

at february 1 2008 we had total outstanding debt including the current portion of longterm obligations of 4282 billion we also had an additional 7692 million available for borrowing under our new senior secured assetbased revolving credit facility at that date our liquidity needs are significant primarily due to our debt service and other obligations 

management believes our cash flow from operations and existing cash balances combined with availability under the new credit facilities described below will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our current obligations projected working capital requirements and capital spending for a period that includes the next twelve months 

 

new credit facilities 

overview  on july 6 2007 in connection with the merger we entered into two senior secured credit agreements each with goldman sachs credit partners lp citicorp global markets inc lehman brothers inc and wachovia capital markets llc each as joint lead arranger and joint bookrunner the cit groupbusiness credit inc is administrative agent under the senior secured credit agreement for the assetbased revolving credit facility and citicorp north america inc is administrative agent under the senior secured credit agreement for the term loan facility 

the new credit facilities provide financing of 3425 billion consisting of 

 

 

 

the term loan credit facility consists of two tranches one of which is a “firstloss” tranche which in certain circumstances is subordinated in right of payment to the other tranche of the term loan credit facility 

 

we are the borrower under the term loan credit facility the primary borrower under the assetbased credit facility and in addition certain subsidiaries of ours are designated as borrowers under this facility the assetbased credit facility includes borrowing capacity available for letters of credit and for shortterm borrowings referred to as swingline loans

the new credit facilities provide that we have the right at any time to request up to 3250 million of incremental commitments under one or more incremental term loan facilities andor assetbased revolving credit facilities the lenders under these facilities are not under any obligation to provide any such incremental commitments and any such addition of or increase in commitments will be subject to our not exceeding certain senior secured leverage ratios and certain other customary conditions precedent our ability to obtain extensions of credit under these incremental commitments will also be subject to the same conditions as extensions of credit under the new credit facilities 

the amount from time to time available under the senior secured assetbased credit facility including in respect of letters of credit shall not exceed the sum of the tranche a borrowing base and the tranche a1 borrowing base the tranche a borrowing base equals the sum of i 85 of the net orderly liquidation value of all our eligible inventory and that of each guarantor thereunder and ii 90 of all our accounts receivable and creditdebit card receivables and that of each guarantor thereunder in each case subject to a reserve equal to the principal amount of the 2010 notes that remain outstanding at any time and other customary reserves and eligibility criteria an additional 10 to 12 of the net orderly liquidation value of all our eligible inventory and that of each guarantor thereunder is made available to us in the form of a “last out” tranche in respect of which we may borrow up to a maximum amount of 1250 

million borrowings under the assetbased credit facility will be incurred first under the last out tranche and no borrowings will be permitted under any other tranche until the last out tranche is fully utilized repayments of the senior secured assetbased revolving credit facility will be applied to the last out tranche only after all other tranches have been fully paid down 

interest rate and fees  borrowings under the new credit facilities bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus at our option either a libor or b a base rate which is usually equal to the prime rate the applicable margin for borrowings is i under the term loan facility 275 with respect to libor borrowings and 175 with respect to baserate borrowings and ii as of february 1 2008 under the assetbased revolving credit facility except in the last out tranche described above 150 with respect to libor borrowings and 050 with respect to baserate borrowings and for any last out borrowings 225 with respect to libor borrowings and 125 with respect to baserate borrowings the applicable margins for borrowings under the assetbased revolving credit facility except in the case of last out borrowings are subject to adjustment each quarter based on average daily excess availability under the assetbased revolving credit facility 

in addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under the new credit facilities we are required to pay a commitment fee to the lenders under the assetbased revolving credit facility in respect of the unutilized commitments thereunder at february 1 2008 the commitment fee rate was 0375 per annum the commitment fee rate will be reduced except with regard to the last out tranche to 025 per annum at any time that the unutilized commitments under the assetbased credit facility are equal to or less than 50 of the aggregate commitments under the assetbased revolving credit facility we must also pay customary letter of credit fees

prepayments   the senior secured credit agreement for the term loan facility requires us to prepay outstanding term loans subject to certain exceptions with 

 

 

 

 

 

the mandatory prepayments discussed above will be applied to the term loan facility as directed by the senior secured credit agreement 

 

in addition the senior secured credit agreement for the assetbased revolving credit facility requires us to prepay the assetbased revolving credit facility subject to certain exceptions with 

 

 

 

we may be obligated to pay a prepayment premium on the amount repaid under the term loan facility if the term loans are voluntarily repaid in whole or in part before july 6 2009 we may voluntarily repay outstanding loans under the assetbased revolving credit facility at any time without premium or penalty other than customary “breakage” costs with respect to libor loans 

 

an event of default under the senior secured credit agreements will occur upon a change of control as defined in the senior secured credit agreements governing our new credit facilities upon an event of default indebtedness under the new credit facilities may be accelerated in which case we will be required to repay all outstanding loans plus accrued and unpaid interest and all other amounts outstanding under the new credit facilities 

 

letters of credit   3500 million of our assetbased revolving credit facility is available for letters of credit

amortization   beginning september 30 2009 we are required to repay installments on the loans under the term loan credit facility in equal quarterly principal amounts in an aggregate amount per annum equal to 1 of the total funded principal amount at july 6 2007 with the balance payable on july 6 2014 there is no amortization under the assetbased revolving credit facility the entire principal amounts if any outstanding under the assetbased revolving credit facility are due and payable in full at maturity on july 6 2013 on which day the commitments thereunder will terminate 

guarantee and security   all obligations under the new credit facilities are unconditionally guaranteed by substantially all of our existing and future domestic subsidiaries excluding certain immaterial subsidiaries and certain subsidiaries designated by us under our senior secured credit agreements as “unrestricted subsidiaries” referred to collectively as us guarantors 

all obligations and related guarantees under the term loan credit facility are secured by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all obligations and related guarantees under the assetbased credit facility are secured by the revolving facility collateral subject to certain exceptions 

 

certain covenants and events of default the senior secured credit agreements contain a number of covenants that among other things restrict subject to certain exceptions our ability to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the senior secured credit agreements also contain certain customary affirmative covenants and events of default 

at february 1 2008 we had 1025 million of borrowings 288 million of commercial letters of credit and 692 million of standby letters of credit outstanding under our assetbased revolving credit facility 

senior notes due 2015 and senior subordinated toggle notes due 2017 

on july 6 2007 we issued 11750 million aggregate principal amount of 10625 senior notes due 2015 the “senior notes” which mature on july 15 2015 pursuant to an 

indenture dated as of july 6 2007 the “senior indenture” and 725 million aggregate principal amount of 1187512625 senior subordinated toggle notes due 2017 the “senior subordinated notes” which mature on july 15 2017 pursuant to an indenture dated as of july 6 2007 the “senior subordinated indenture” the senior notes and the senior subordinated notes are collectively referred to herein as the “notes” the senior indenture and the senior subordinated indenture are collectively referred to herein as the “indentures” 

 

interest on the notes is payable on january 15 and july 15 of each year commencing january 15 2008 interest on the senior notes will be payable in cash cash interest on the senior subordinated notes will accrue at a rate of 11875 per annum and pik interest as that term is defined below will accrue at a rate of 12625 per annum the initial interest payment on the senior subordinated notes will be payable in cash for any interest period thereafter through july 15 2011 we may elect to pay interest on the senior subordinated notes i in cash ii by increasing the principal amount of the senior subordinated notes or issuing new senior subordinated notes “pik interest” or iii by paying interest on half of the principal amount of the senior subordinated notes in cash interest and half in pik interest after july 15 2011 all interest on the senior subordinated notes will be payable in cash 

 

the notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by each of the existing and future direct or indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries that guarantee the obligations under our new credit facilities 

 

we may redeem some or all of the notes at any time at redemption prices described or set forth in the indentures we repurchased 250 million of the 1187512625 senior subordinated toggle notes in the fourth quarter of 2007 

 

change of control upon the occurrence of a change of control which is defined in the indentures each holder of the notes has the right to require us to repurchase some or all of such holder’s notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101 of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest if any to the repurchase date 

covenants   the indentures contain covenants limiting among other things our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to subject to certain exceptions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

events of default the indentures also provide for events of default which if any of them occurs would permit or require the principal of and accrued interest on the notes to become or to be declared due and payable 

registration rights agreement  on july 6 2007 we entered into a registration rights agreement with respect to the notes in the registration rights agreement we agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to register with the sec new senior notes having substantially identical terms as the senior notes and new senior subordinated notes having substantially identical terms as the senior subordinated notes we filed this registration statement with the sec and it was declared effective in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 we subsequently commenced the offer to exchange the new senior notes and the new senior subordinated notes for each of the outstanding senior notes and the outstanding senior subordinated notes respectively the exchange offer expired on march 17 2008 all of the outstanding senior notes and senior subordinated notes were tendered in the exchange offer 

 

adjusted ebitda 

under the new credit facilities and the indentures certain limitations and restrictions could occur if we are not able to satisfy and remain in compliance with specified financial ratios management believes the most significant of such ratios is the senior secured incurrence test under the new credit facilities this test measures the ratio of the senior secured debt to adjusted ebitda this ratio would need to be no greater than 425 to 1 to avoid such limitations and restrictions as of february 1 2008 this ratio was 34 to 1 senior secured debt is defined as our total debt secured by liens or similar encumbrances less cash and cash equivalents ebitda is defined as income loss from continuing operations before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle plus interest and other financing costs net provision for income taxes and depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda is defined as ebitda further adjusted to give effect to adjustments required in calculating this covenant ratio under our new credit facilities ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not presentations made in accordance with gaap are not measures of financial performance or condition liquidity or profitability and should not be considered as an alternative to 1 net income operating income or any other performance measures determined in accordance with gaap or 2 operating cash flows determined in accordance with gaap additionally ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not intended to be measures of free cash flow for management’s discretionary use as they do not consider certain cash requirements such as interest payments tax payments and debt service requirements and replacements of fixed assets 

our presentation of ebitda and adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap because not all companies use identical calculations these presentations of ebitda and adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of 

other companies we believe that the presentation of ebitda and adjusted ebitda is appropriate to provide additional information about the calculation of this financial ratio in the new credit facilities adjusted ebitda is a material component of this ratio specifically noncompliance with the senior secured indebtedness ratio contained in our new credit facilities could prohibit us from being able to incur additional secured indebtedness other than the additional funding provided for under the senior secured credit agreement and pursuant to specified exceptions to make investments to incur liens and to make certain restricted payments 

 

the calculation of adjusted ebitda under the new credit facilities is as follows 

 

other considerations 

our inventory balance represented approximately 44 of our total assets exclusive of goodwill and other intangible assets as of february 1 2008 our proficiency in managing our inventory balances can have a significant impact on our cash flows from operations during a given fiscal year we have made more efficient inventory management a strategic priority as more fully discussed in the “executive overview” above 

 

during 2006 and 2005 the predecessor’s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 500 million and 10 million shares respectively of the predecessor’s outstanding common stock these authorizations allowed purchases in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time subject to market conditions during 2006 we purchased approximately 45 million shares pursuant to the 2005 authorization at a total cost of 799 million during 2005 we purchased approximately 150 million shares pursuant to the 2005 and a prior authorization at a total cost of 2976 million 

 

we may seek from time to time to retire the notes as defined above through cash purchases on the open market in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise such repurchases if any will depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors the amounts involved may be material 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of february 1 2008 in thousands 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in 2007 and 2006 our south carolinabased wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary ashley river insurance company “aric” had cash and cash equivalents and investments balances held pursuant to south carolina regulatory requirements to maintain a specified percentage of aric’s liability and equity balances primarily insurance liabilities in the form of certain specified types of assets and as such these investments are not available for general corporate purposes at february 1 2008 these cash and cash equivalents balances and investments balances were 119 million and 515 million respectively 

 

during 2005 we incurred significant losses caused by hurricane katrina primarily inventory and fixed assets in the form of store fixtures and leasehold improvements we reached final settlement of our related insurance claim in 2006 and received proceeds totaling 210 million due to these losses including 130 million in 2006 and 80 million in 2005 and have utilized a portion of these proceeds to replace lost assets insurance proceeds related to fixed assets are included in cash flows from investing activities and proceeds related to inventory losses and business interruption are included in cash flows from operating activities 

legal actions claims and tax contingencies  as described in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements we are involved in a number of legal actions and claims some of which could potentially result in material cash payments adverse developments in those actions could materially and adversely affect our liquidity as discussed in note 5 we also have certain income taxrelated contingencies as more fully described below under “critical accounting policies and estimates” future negative developments could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity 

considerations regarding distribution center leases  the merger and certain of the related financing transactions may be interpreted as giving rise to certain trigger events which may include events of default under our three distribution center leases in that event our additional cost of acquiring the underlying land and building assets could approximate 112 million at this time we do not believe such issues would result in the purchase of these distribution centers however the payments associated with such an outcome would have a negative impact on our liquidity to minimize the uncertainty associated with such possible interpretations we are negotiating the restructuring of these leases and the related underlying debt we have concluded that a probable loss exists in connection with the restructurings and have recorded associated sga expenses in the successor financial statements for the period ended february 1 2008 totaling 120 million the ultimate resolution of these negotiations may result in changes in the amounts of such losses which changes may be material 

credit ratings on june 12 2007 standard  poor’s revised our longterm debt rating to b and left our longterm debt ratings on negative watch moody’s revised our longterm debt rating to b3 with a stable outlook these current ratings are considered noninvestment grade our current credit ratings as well as future rating agency actions could 1 negatively impact our ability to obtain financings to finance our operations on satisfactory terms 2 have the effect of increasing our financing costs and 3 have the effect of increasing our insurance premiums and collateral requirements necessary for our selfinsured programs 

cash flows 

the discussion of the cash flows from operating investing and financing activities included below for 2007 is generally based on the combination of the predecessor and successor for the 52week period ended february 1 2008 which we believe provides a more meaningful understanding of our liquidity and capital resources for the time period presented 

 

cash flows from operating activities cash flows from operating activities for 2007 compared to 2006 increased by 362 million notwithstanding a decline in net income loss of 1508 million as described in detail under “results of operations” above and which is partially attributable to 1026 million of transaction and related costs in 2007 other significant components of the change in cash flows from operating activities in 2007 as compared to 2006 were changes in inventory balances which decreased by approximately 10 during 2007 compared to a decrease of approximately 3 during 2006 inventory levels in the seasonal category declined by 845 million or 24 in 2007 compared to a 67 million or 2 increase in 2006 the highly consumable category declined by 424 million or 6 in 2007 compared to a 632 million or 10 increase in 2006 the home products category increased by 35 million or 2 in 2007 as compared to a 525 million or 25 decline in 2006 the basic clothing category decreased by 203 million or 9 in 2007 as compared to a 595 million or 21 decrease in 2006 in addition to inventory changes the decline in net income was a principal factor in the reduction in income taxes paid in 2007 as compared to 2006 also offsetting the decline in net income were changes in accrued expenses in 2007 as compared to 2006 which increased primarily due to income tax related reserves accrued interest incentive compensation accrual the accrued loss in connection with the ongoing negotiations to restructure our distribution center leases and accruals for lease liabilities on closed stores 

cash flows from operating activities for 2006 compared to 2005 declined by 1501 million the most significant component of the decline in cash flows from operating activities in 2006 as compared to 2005 was the reduction in net income as described in detail under “results of operations” above partially offsetting this decline are certain noncash charges included in net income including belowcost markdowns on inventory balances and property and equipment impairment charges totaling 781 million and a 138 million increase in noncash depreciation and amortization charges in 2006 as compared to 2005 in addition the reduction in 2006 year end inventory balances reflect the effect of belowcost markdowns and our efforts to sell through excess inventories as compared with increases in 2005 and 2004 seasonal inventory levels increased by 2 in 2006 as compared to a 10 increase in 2005 home products inventory levels declined by 25 in 2006 as compared to a 2 increase in 2005 while basic clothing inventory levels declined by 21 in 2006 as compared to a 5 decline in 2005 total merchandise inventories at the end of 2006 were 143 billion compared to 147 billion at the end of 2005 a 29 decrease overall and a 64 decrease on a per store basis reflecting both our focus on liquidating packaway merchandise and the effect of belowcost markdowns 

cash flows from investing activities  the merger as discussed in more detail above required cash payments of approximately 67 billion net of cash acquired of 350 million significant components of property and equipment purchases in 2007 included the following approximate amounts 60 million for improvements upgrades remodels and relocations of existing stores 45 million for new stores and 30 million for distribution and transportationrelated capital expenditures during 2007 we opened 365 new stores and remodeled or relocated 300 stores 

during 2007 we purchased a secured promissory note for 370 million which represents debt issued by a thirdparty entity from which we lease our distribution center in ardmore oklahoma purchases and sales of shortterm investments in 2007 which equaled net sales of 221 million primarily reflect our investment activities in our captive insurance subsidiary and all purchases of longterm investments are related to the captive insurance subsidiary 

cash flows used in investing activities totaling 2820 million in 2006 were primarily related to capital expenditures and to a lesser degree purchases of longterm investments significant components of our property and equipment purchases in 2006 included the following approximate amounts 66 million for distribution and transportationrelated capital expenditures including approximately 30 million related to our distribution center in marion indiana which opened in 2006 66 million for new stores 50 million for the ezstore tm project and 38 million for capital projects in existing stores during 2006 we opened 537 new stores and remodeled or relocated 64 stores 

purchases and sales of shortterm investments in 2006 which equaled net sales of 19 million reflect our investment activities in taxexempt auction rate securities as well as investing activities of our captive insurance subsidiary purchases of longterm investments are related to the captive insurance subsidiary 

significant components of our purchases of property and equipment in 2005 included the following approximate amounts 102 million for distribution and transportationrelated capital expenditures 96 million for new stores 47 million related to the ezstore tm project 18 million for certain fixtures in existing stores and 15 million for various systemsrelated capital projects during 2005 we opened 734 new stores and relocated or remodeled 82 stores distribution and transportation expenditures in 2005 included costs associated with the construction of our new distribution centers in south carolina and indiana 

net sales of shortterm investments in 2005 of 341 million primarily reflect our investment activities in taxexempt auction rate securities purchases of longterm investments are related to our captive insurance subsidiary 

capital expenditures during 2008 are projected to be approximately 200 to 220 million we anticipate funding 2008 capital requirements with cash flows from operations and our revolving credit facility if necessary significant components of the 2008 capital plan include growth initiatives as well as continued investment in our existing store base plans for remodeling and relocating approximately 400 stores additional investments in our supply chain and leasehold improvements and fixtures and equipment for approximately 200 new stores we plan to undertake these expenditures in order to improve our infrastructure and enhance our cash generated from operating activities 

 

cash flows from financing activities  to finance the merger we issued longterm debt of approximately 42 billion and issued common stock in the amount of approximately 28 billion we incurred costs associated with the issuance of mergerrelated longterm debt of 874 million as discussed above we completed a cash tender offer for our 2010 notes approximately 99 of the 2010 notes were validly tendered resulting in repayments of longterm debt and related consent fees in the amount of 2156 million borrowings net of repayments under our new assetbased revolving credit facility in 2007 totaled 1025 million 

 

cash flows used in financing activities during 2006 included the repurchase of approximately 45 million shares of our common stock at a total cost of 799 million cash dividends paid of 625 million or 020 per share on our outstanding common stock and 141 million to reduce our outstanding capital lease and financing obligations these uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options during 2006 of 199 million 

during 2005 we repurchased approximately 150 million shares of our common stock at a total cost of 2976 million paid cash dividends of 562 million or 0175 per share on our outstanding common stock and expended 143 million to reduce our outstanding capital lease and financing obligations also in 2005 we received proceeds of 145 million from the issuance of a tax increment financing in conjunction with the construction of our new distribution center in indiana and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of 294 million 

the borrowings and repayments under the revolving credit agreements in 2007 2006 and 2005 were primarily a result of activity associated with periodic cash needs 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures in addition to the estimates presented below there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed critical as defined below we believe these estimates are reasonable and appropriate however if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used the resulting changes could have a material effect on the financial statements taken as a whole 

management believes the following policies and estimates are critical because they involve significant judgments assumptions and estimates management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosures presented below relating to those policies and estimates 

 

merchandise inventories  merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined using the retail lastin firstout “lifo” method under our retail inventory method “rim” the calculation of gross profit and the resulting valuation of inventories at cost are computed by applying a calculated costtoretail inventory ratio to the retail value of sales the rim is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality also it is recognized that the use of the rim will result in valuing inventories at the lower of cost or market “lcm” if markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories 

inherent in the rim calculation are certain significant management judgments and estimates including among others initial markups markdowns and shrinkage which significantly impact the gross profit calculation as well as the ending inventory valuation at cost these significant estimates coupled with the fact that the rim is an averaging process can under certain circumstances produce distorted cost figures factors that can lead to distortion in the calculation of the inventory balance include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

factors that reduce potential distortion include the use of historical experience in estimating the shrink provision see discussion below and recent improvements in the lifo analysis whereby all skus are considered in the index formulation as part of this process we also perform an inventoryaging analysis for determining obsolete inventory our policy is to write down inventory to an lcm value based on various management assumptions including estimated markdowns and sales required to liquidate such aged inventory in future periods inventory is reviewed on a quarterly basis and adjusted as appropriate to reflect writedowns determined to be necessary 

factors such as slower inventory turnover due to changes in competitors’ tactics consumer preferences consumer spending and unseasonable weather patterns among other factors could cause excess inventory requiring greater than estimated markdowns to entice consumer purchases resulting in an unfavorable impact on our consolidated financial statements sales shortfalls due to the above factors could cause reduced purchases from vendors and associated vendor allowances that would also result in an unfavorable impact on our consolidated financial statements 

we calculate our shrink provision based on actual physical inventory results during the fiscal period and an accrual for estimated shrink occurring subsequent to a physical inventory through the end of the fiscal reporting period this accrual is calculated as a percentage of sales at each retail store at a department level and is determined by dividing the booktophysical inventory adjustments recorded during the previous twelve months by the related sales for the same period for each store to the extent that subsequent physical inventories yield different results than this estimated accrual our effective shrink rate for a given reporting period will include the impact of adjusting the estimated results to the actual results although we perform physical inventories in virtually all of our stores on an annual basis the same stores do not necessarily get counted in the same reporting periods from year to year which could impact comparability in a given reporting period 

 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets under sfas 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” we are required to test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators occur significant judgments required in this testing process may include projecting future cash flows determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions projections are based on management’s best estimate given recent financial performance market trends strategic plans and other available information changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value or impairment future indicators of impairment could result in an asset impairment charge 

purchase accounting the merger was accounted for as a reverse acquisition in accordance with the purchase accounting provisions of sfas 141 “business combinations” under which our assets and liabilities have been accounted for at their estimated fair values as of the date of the merger the aggregate purchase price was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon an assessment of their relative fair values as of the date of the merger these estimates of fair values the allocation of the purchase price and other factors related to the accounting for the merger are subject to significant judgments and the use of estimates 

property and equipment  property and equipment are recorded at cost we group our assets into relatively homogeneous classes and generally provide for depreciation on a straightline basis over the estimated average useful life of each asset class except for leasehold improvements which are amortized over the shorter of the applicable lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset certain store and warehouse fixtures when fully depreciated are removed from the cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization accounts the valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful depreciable lives involves significant judgments and the use of estimates 

impairment of longlived assets we review the carrying value of all longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” we review for impairment stores open more than two years for which current cash flows from operations are negative impairment results when the carrying value of the assets exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows over the life of the lease our estimate of undiscounted future cash flows over the lease term is based upon historical operations of the stores and estimates of future store profitability which encompasses many factors that are subject to variability and are difficult to predict if a longlived asset is found to be impaired the amount recognized for impairment is equal to the difference between the carrying value and the asset’s fair value the fair value is estimated based primarily upon future cash flows discounted at our credit adjusted riskfree rate or other reasonable estimates of fair market value 

 

insurance liabilities  we retain a significant portion of the risk for our workers’ compensation employee health insurance general liability property loss and automobile coverage these costs are significant primarily due to the large employee base and number of stores at the date of the merger this liability was discounted in accordance with purchase accounting standards subsequent to the merger provisions are made to this insurance liability on an undiscounted basis based on actual claim data and estimates of incurred but not reported claims developed using actuarial methodologies based on historical claim trends if future claim trends deviate from recent historical patterns we may be required to record additional expenses or expense reductions which could be material to our future financial results 

contingent liabilities – income taxes income tax reserves are determined using the methodology established by the financial accounting standards board “fasb” interpretation 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes – an interpretation of fasb statement 109 “fin 48” fin 48 which we adopted on february 3 2007 requires companies to assess each income tax position taken using a two step process a determination is first made as to whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained based upon the technical merits upon examination by the taxing authorities if the tax position is expected to meet the more likely than not criteria the benefit recorded for the tax position equals the largest amount that is greater than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement of the respective tax position uncertain tax positions require determinations and estimated liabilities to be made based on provisions of the tax law which may be subject to change or varying interpretation if our determinations and estimates prove to be inaccurate the resulting adjustments could be material to our future financial results 

contingent liabilities  legal matters    we are subject to legal regulatory and other proceedings and claims we establish liabilities as appropriate for these claims and proceedings based upon the probability and estimability of losses and to fairly present in conjunction with the disclosures of these matters in our financial statements and sec filings management’s view of our exposure we review outstanding claims and proceedings with external counsel to assess probability and estimates of loss we reevaluate these assessments on a quarterly basis or as new and significant information becomes available to determine whether a liability should be established or if any existing liability should be adjusted the actual cost of resolving a claim or proceeding ultimately may be substantially different than the amount of the recorded liability in addition because it is not permissible under gaap to establish a litigation liability until the loss is both probable and estimable in some cases there may be insufficient time to establish a liability prior to the actual incurrence of the loss upon verdict and judgment at trial for example or in the case of a quickly negotiated settlement see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements 

lease accounting and excess facilities  the majority of our stores are subject to shortterm leases usually with initial or primary terms of 3 to 5 years with multiple renewal options 

 

when available we also have stores subject to buildtosuit arrangements with landlords which typically carry a primary lease term of 10 years with multiple renewal options approximately half of our stores have provisions for contingent rentals based upon a percentage of defined sales volume we recognize contingent rental expense when the achievement of specified sales targets is considered probable we recognize rent expense over the term of the lease we record minimum rental expense on a straightline basis over the base noncancelable lease term commencing on the date that we take physical possession of the property from the landlord which normally includes a period prior to store opening to make necessary leasehold improvements and install store fixtures when a lease contains a predetermined fixed escalation of the minimum rent we recognize the related rent expense on a straightline basis and record the difference between the recognized rental expense and the amounts payable under the lease as deferred rent we also receive tenant allowances which we record as deferred incentive rent and amortize as a reduction to rent expense over the term of the lease we reflect as a liability any difference between the calculated expense and the amounts actually paid improvements of leased properties are amortized over the shorter of the life of the applicable lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset 

for store closures excluding those associated with a business combination where a lease obligation still exists we record the estimated future liability associated with the rental obligation on the date the store is closed in accordance with sfas 146 “accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities” based on an overall analysis of store performance and expected trends management periodically evaluates the need to close underperforming stores liabilities are established at the point of closure for the present value of any remaining operating lease obligations net of estimated sublease income and at the communication date for severance and other exit costs as prescribed by sfas 146 key assumptions in calculating the liability include the timeframe expected to terminate lease agreements estimates related to the sublease potential of closed locations and estimation of other related exit costs if actual timing and potential termination costs or realization of sublease income differ from our estimates the resulting liabilities could vary from recorded amounts these liabilities are reviewed periodically and adjusted when necessary 

sharebased payments  our sharebased stock option awards are valued on an individual grant basis using the blackscholesmerton closed form option pricing model the application of this valuation model involves assumptions that are judgmental and highly sensitive in the valuation of stock options which affects compensation expense related to these options these assumptions include the term that the options are expected to be outstanding an estimate of the volatility of our stock price which is based on a peer group of publicly traded companies applicable interest rates and the dividend yield of our stock other factors involving judgments that affect the expensing of sharebased payments include estimated forfeiture rates of sharebased awards if our estimates differ materially from actual experience we may be required to record additional expense or reductions of expense which could be material to our future financial results 

 

adoption of accounting standard 

we adopted the provisions of fin 48 effective february 3 2007 the adoption resulted in an 89 million decrease in retained earnings and a reclassification of certain amounts between deferred income taxes and other noncurrent liabilities to conform to the balance sheet presentation requirements of fin 48 as of the date of adoption the total reserve for uncertain tax benefits was 779 million this reserve excludes the federal income tax benefit for the uncertain tax positions related to state income taxes which is now included in deferred tax assets as a result of the adoption of fin 48 the reserve for interest expense related to income taxes was increased to 153 million and a reserve for potential penalties of 19 million related to uncertain income tax positions was recorded as of the date of adoption approximately 271 million of the reserve for uncertain tax positions would impact our effective income tax rate if we were to recognize the tax benefit for these positions after the merger and the related application of purchase accounting no portion of the reserve for uncertain tax positions that existed as of the date of adoption would impact our effective tax rate but would if subsequently recognized reduce the amount of goodwill recorded in relation to the merger 

subsequent to the adoption of fin 48 we elected to record income tax related interest and penalties as a component of the provision for income tax expense 

accounting pronouncements 

in march 2008 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 161 “disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities” an amendment of fasb statement no 133 sfas 161 applies to all derivative instruments and nonderivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments pursuant to paragraphs 37 and 42 of sfas 133 and related hedged items accounted for under sfas 133 sfas 161 requires entities to provide greater transparency through additional disclosures about how and why an entity uses derivative instruments how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under sfas 133 and its related interpretations and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s financial position results of operations and cash flows sfas 161 is effective as of the beginning of an entity’s first fiscal year that begins after november 15 2008 we currently plan to adopt sfas 161 during our 2009 fiscal year no determination has yet been made regarding the potential impact of this standard on our financial statements 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 141r “business combinations” the new standard establishes the requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest formerly minority interest in an acquiree provides updated requirements for recognition and measurement of goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase and provides updated disclosure requirements to enable users of financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination this statement applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december 15 2008 early adoption is not allowed this standard is not expected to impact our financial statements unless a qualifying transaction is consummated subsequent to the effective date 

 

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilitiesincluding an amendment of fasb statement no 115” sfas 159 sfas 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value it provides entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions sfas 159 is effective as of the beginning of an entity’s first fiscal year that begins after november 15 2007 we currently plan to adopt sfas 159 during our 2008 fiscal year we are in the process of evaluating the potential impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas 157 “fair value measurements” sfas 157 provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities the standard also requires expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value the information used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings the standard applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value the standard does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances sfas 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years for nonfinancial assets and liabilities the effective date has been delayed to fiscal years beginning after november 15 2008 we currently expect to adopt sfas 157 during our 2008 and 2009 fiscal years we are in the process of evaluating the potential impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend 

 

financial risk management 

we are exposed to market risk primarily from adverse changes in interest rates to minimize this risk we may periodically use financial instruments including derivatives as a matter of policy we do not buy or sell financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes and all derivative financial instrument transactions must be authorized and executed pursuant to approval by the board of directors all financial instrument positions taken by us are intended to be used to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure because of high correlation between the derivative financial instrument and the underlying exposure being hedged fluctuations in the value of the financial instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying economic exposure the financial instruments we use are straightforward instruments with liquid markets 

interest rate risk 

we manage our interest rate risk through the strategic use of fixed and variable interest rate debt and from time to time derivative financial instruments our principal interest rate exposure relates to outstanding amounts under our new credit facilities our new credit facilities provide for variable rate borrowings of up to 34250 million including availability of 11250 million under our senior secured assetbased revolving credit facility subject to the borrowing base in order to mitigate a portion of the variable rate interest exposure under the new credit facilities we entered into interest rate swaps with affiliates of goldman sachs  co lehman brothers inc and wachovia capital markets llc pursuant to the swaps which became effective on july 31 2007 we swapped three month libor rates for fixed interest rates which will result in the payment of a fixed rate of 768 on a notional amount of 20000 million which will amortize on a quarterly basis until maturity at july 31 2012 at february 1 2008 the notional amount was 16300 million 

 

a change in interest rates on variable rate debt impacts our pretax earnings and cash flows whereas a change in interest rates on fixed rate debt impacts the economic fair value of debt but not our pretax earnings and cash flows our derivatives qualify for hedge accounting as cash flow hedges therefore changes in market fluctuations related to the effective portion of these cash flow hedges do not impact our pretax earnings until the accrued interest is recognized on the derivatives and the associated hedged debt based on our outstanding debt as of february 1 2008 and assuming that our mix of debt instruments derivative instruments and other variables remain the same the annualized effect of a one percentage point change in variable interest rates would have a pretax impact on our earnings and cash flows of approximately 79 million 

the interest rate swaps are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” as amended and interpreted collectively “sfas 133” sfas 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 133 requires that all derivatives be recognized as either assets or liabilities at fair value beginning october 12 2007 we are accounting for the swaps described above as cash flow hedges and record the effective portion of changes in fair value of the swaps within accumulated other comprehensive income 

subsequent to the 2007 fiscal year end we entered into a 3500 million stepdown interest rate swap which became effective february 28 2008 in order to mitigate an additional portion of the variable rate interest exposure under the new credit facilities we entered into the swap with wachovia capital markets and we swapped one month libor rates for fixed interest rates which will result in the payment of a fixed rate of 558 on a notional amount of 3500 million for the first year and 1500 million for the second year

 item 11 executive compensation tableend 

 

a   executive compensation  we refer to the persons included in the summary compensation table below as our “named executive officers” or “neos” in addition references to “2007” mean our fiscal year ended february 1 2008 references to the “merger” mean our merger that occurred on july 6 2007 discussed more fully elsewhere in this document references to the “merger agreement” mean the agreement governing the merger and references to “project alpha” refer to certain strategic initiatives discussed in the “executive overview” section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in this document 

 

compensation discussion and analysis 

 

executive compensation philosophy and objectives 

we strive to attract retain and motivate persons with superior ability to reward outstanding performance and to align our neos’ and shareholders’ longterm interests our material compensation principles applicable to 2007 neo compensation included the following all of which are discussed in more detail in “elements of 2007 neo compensation” below 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

beginning in 2004 2003 with respect to mr david perdue the compensation committee authorized employment agreements with neos which among other things set forth minimum levels of certain compensation components because the committee believed based on benchmarking data that such arrangements were a common protection offered to neos at comparable companies and because contracts were needed to ensure continuity and to retain neos to execute changes necessary to meet our strategic objectives the committee also wanted to give standard protections to both the neos and to us upon the termination of any neo’s employment 

compensation process 

oversight of 2007 neo compensation  prior to the merger the compensation committee was responsible for recommending ceo compensation to the independent directors of our board and for approving compensation of other neos the independent directors of the board retained sole authority to determine ceo compensation prior to the merger the committee members were messrs dennis bottorff reginald dickson and e gordon gee subsequent to the merger our board made all executive compensation decisions until a new compensation committee was established in march 2008 

use of outside advisors in determining neo compensation  prior to the merger the compensation committee selected hewitt associates as its compensation consultant hewitt also provides consulting services to our human resources group both with respect to management’s work in connection with neo compensation as described below under “management’s role in determining or recommending 2007 neo compensation” and in connection with general employee compensation and benefits matters 

prior to the merger the committee approved a written agreement with hewitt describing the general terms of the working relationship in particular hewitt may perform compensation consulting services upon management or committee request which services may include competitive market pay analyses support regarding legal regulatory or accounting considerations impacting compensation programs redesign of those programs assistance with market data trends and competitive practices meeting preparation and attendance and other miscellaneous work 

management’s role in determining or recommending 2007 neo compensation  prior to the merger management assisted hewitt in gathering and analyzing relevant competitive data and identifying and evaluating various alternatives for 2007 compensation mr perdue while he served as ceo and ms challis lowe regularly provided their recommendations in compensation committee meetings regarding neo compensation and assisted hewitt in making presentations to the committee mr perdue participated fully with the committee in assessing neo performance and made recommendations on the compensation level for each neo pay component prior to the merger no member of management attended the committee’s own private session 

in connection with the merger neos were represented by legal counsel who negotiated on their behalf with kkr and its legal counsel with respect to the terms of the new longterm incentive plan such negotiations did not address the amounts or value of the grants to be given under that plan upon the closing of the merger messrs richard dreiling and david beré also were represented by legal counsel in negotiations with respect to the terms of their employment agreements and compensation 

while the board and the committee valued and welcomed the input of management board and committee members ultimately made all 2007 neo compensation decisions 

use of market benchmarking data in determining 2007 neo compensation  to attract and retain neos who we believe will enhance our longterm business results we must pay compensation that is competitive with the external market for executive talent we believe that the primary neo talent market consists of retail companies with revenues and business models similar to ours because those companies have executive positions similar in breadth complexity and scope of responsibility to our neo positions for 2007 the compensation committee directed hewitt to provide data on total and individual compensation elements from its proprietary salary survey database and from the proxy statements of selected retail companies that met these criteria we refer to this combined group as the market comparator group in 2007 this group consisted of advance auto parts autozone family dollar kohl’s limited brands long drug stores nordstrom officemax office depot radioshack staples jc penney the 

 

gap federated department stores blockbuster the pantry ross stores and supervalue inc hewitt was also asked to provide proxy statement information for certain other significantly larger retail companies walmart target walgreen’s and cvs to be used as additional reference points in assessing the appropriateness of our neos’ compensation levels 

the committee believed that the median of the competitive market generally was the appropriate target for an neo’s total compensation although the target for each compensation component relative to the competitive market varied 

elements of 2007 neo compensation 

we provide compensation in the form of base salary shortterm incentives longterm incentives benefits and perquisites as discussed in more detail below the compensation committee believed that each of these elements was a necessary component of an neo’s compensation package and was consistent with compensation programs at competing companies prior to the merger the committee reviewed base salary shortterm incentives and longterm incentives at least annually and other elements periodically when material changes were considered 

base salary base salary generally promotes the recruiting and retention functions of our compensation principles by reflecting the salaries for comparable positions in the competitive marketplace the committee believed that we would be unable to attract or retain quality neos in the absence of competitive base salary levels for this reason base salary constitutes a significant portion of an neo’s total compensation base salary also furthers our pay for performance role of our philosophy because as a threshold matter an neo is not eligible for a salary increase unless he or she achieves a satisfactory overall performance evaluation 

in determining each neo’s 2007 base salary the committee reviewed with mr perdue his evaluation of each neo’s individual performance the evaluations included a review of performance versus goals established earlier in 2006 except for mr beré who did not have established goals because he was hired near the end of fiscal 2006 because the committee agreed with mr perdue’s conclusion that each neo performed satisfactorily overall in 2006 each neo was eligible as a threshold matter for a salary increase 

the committee also reviewed the benchmarking data provided by hewitt as described above and considered certain provisions in the merger agreement limiting the aggregate employee base salary increase pool to no more than 3 because hewitt’s data showed that existing base salaries with a 3 increase would continue to approximate the market median the committee approved a 3 base salary increase for each neo in 2007 

subsequent to the fiscal 2007 year end but prior to the filing of this document the new compensation committee considered the 2008 base salary increases for each neo mr dreiling with mr beré’s input reviewed the 2007 individual performance of each neo including a review of performance versus goals established earlier in 2007 because mr dreiling determined that each neo performed satisfactorily overall in 2007 as a threshold matter each neo was eligible for a salary increase 

the committee reviewed benchmarking data provided by hewitt of a market comparator group substantially similar to the group used for purposes of 2007 compensation decisions with the addition of payless shoe source retail ventures and big lots and the removal of office depot and radioshack this benchmarking data showed that there was a significant movement in the market median for ms guion’s position and as a result the committee adjusted her pay accordingly the committee approved 3 base salary increases for all neos other than mr dreiling who did not receive a base salary increase since he was hired shortly before the end of the 2007 fiscal year and ms guion who received an approximate 155 base salary increase for the reason discussed above in order to maintain base salaries at the median of the market comparator group 

shortterm incentive plan our shortterm incentive plan called teamshare serves to motivate neos to achieve certain objective financial goals that are established early in the fiscal year as is the case with base salary as a threshold matter an neo may not receive a teamshare payout unless he or she receives a satisfactory overall performance evaluation even if the teamshare financial goal is attained accordingly teamshare fulfills a part of our pay for performance philosophy while aligning our neos’ and shareholders’ interests teamshare also helps us meet our recruiting and retention objectives by providing compensation opportunities that are consistent with those prevalent in our market comparator group 

a 2007 teamshare structure  teamshare authorizes the payment of cash bonuses calculated as a percentage of base salary based on our performance measured against a financial performance measure established early in the fiscal year “threshold” “target” and “maximum” performance goals are set along with corresponding potential payout percentages payouts are prorated between threshold and maximum levels in relation to actual performance results 

in 2007 the compensation committee had decided to reevaluate its historical use of net income as the teamshare performance measure given changes in our business strategy but before that evaluation could occur we announced the proposed merger and agreed to consult with kkr on significant changes to certain of our normal business practices kkr requested and the committee agreed to adopt a metric based principally upon earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda as the sole 2007 teamshare performance measure after discussions with kkr the committee set this performance target for 2007 at 570 million which was equal to our annual financial objective consistent with prior practice and after consultation with kkr the committee also set the threshold and maximum levels at 90 and 110 respectively of the target level the committee considered the teamshare performance target to be challenging and generally consistent with the level of difficulty of achievement associated with our performancebased awards for prior years we did not achieve the threshold teamshare performance level in fiscal years 2006 or 2005 we achieved teamshare performance levels between threshold and target in fiscal years 2004 and 2002 and at maximum in fiscal year 2003 

the committee directed that our teamshare 2007 ebitda performance measure be computed using numbers from our issued financial statements adjusted to exclude 

 

 

 

 

 

the committee then set the potential teamshare payout range for the neos other than mr perdue and mr dreiling see “compensation of mr perdue” and “compensation of mr dreiling” below and mr beré see below at the following base salary percentages 325 threshold 65 target and 130 maximum in determining this range the committee reviewed hewitt’s benchmarking information regarding competitive target incentives for comparable positions in our market comparator group this analysis showed that our existing target salary payout percentages generally exceeded the market median but that our total direct compensation would remain at or slightly above the market median because our longterm incentive compensation remains significantly below the market median the committee also continued to rely on hewitt’s prior year benchmarking data which indicated that the typical practice was to set the threshold payout percentage at half of the target and the maximum payout percentage at twice the target accordingly the committee made no changes to the potential payout range for those neos from the prior year 

mr beré assumed the position of interim ceo upon mr perdue’s resignation on july 6 2007 at that time the board set mr beré’s potential teamshare payout percentages at 35 threshold 140 target and 280 maximum of base salary upon achievement of ebitdabased performance levels of 630 million threshold 700 million target and 770 million maximum mr beré’s performance target level as well as the calculation of the related ebitdabased performance metric were chosen to match the level used for vesting purposes for the performancebased options discussed below under “longterm incentive program” granted to the neos on july 6 2007 threshold and maximum performance levels were set at 90 and 110 of the target level mr beré’s fiscal 2007 bonus opportunity was not based on a prorated graduated scale for performance between the threshold and target and the target and maximum levels 

b 2007 teamshare results  mr dreiling with mr beré’s input reviewed the 2007 individual performance of each neo including a review of performance versus goals established earlier in 2007 because mr dreiling determined that each neo performed satisfactorily overall in 2007 as a threshold matter each neo was eligible to receive a 2007 teamshare payout to the extent we achieved the relevant ebitda performance target in march 2008 our new compensation committee approved an ebitda calculation for this purpose between the “target” and “maximum” performance levels accordingly each neo received a teamshare payout in the amount reflected in the “nonequity incentive plan compensation” column of the summary compensation table at the following percentages of base salary mr dreiling 127 based on an annualization of his partial fiscal 2007 salary mr beré 140 and mr tehle mr buley ms guion and ms lowe 826 

 

longterm incentive program longterm equity incentives motivate neos to focus on longterm success for shareholders these incentives also provide a balance between shortterm and longterm goals prior to the merger we delivered these incentives as equity grants structured to recognize stock price changes the compensation committee targeted a certain economic value to be delivered through these incentives which an neo would realize only if our stock price increased longterm incentives are also important to our compensation program’s recruiting and retention objectives because most of the companies in our market comparator group offer them following the merger our longterm incentives are designed to compensate neos for a longterm commitment to us while motivating sustained increases in our financial performance 

prior to the merger the committee typically made equity grant decisions when it reviewed other compensation decisions and evaluated neo performance and it was our practice to establish option exercise prices as the closing market price on the grant date we typically released our annual earnings and other financial results shortly thereafter but the grants were made regardless of whether earnings were favorable or unfavorable in accordance with our usual practice the committee made premerger 2007 annual equity grant decisions prior to the annual earnings release but after the announcement of the proposed merger 

because hewitt’s benchmarking data indicated that our target longterm incentive values for neos other than mr perdue were significantly below the median of our market comparator group the committee decided in fiscal 2006 to increase that value by approximately 2025 for fiscal 2006 compensation at the same time the committee also decided to change the optionsrestricted stock units “rsus” allocation from the previous 8020 to 7030 for fiscal 2006 compensation which according to hewitt more closely aligned with market practice in 2007 the committee decided to further adjust the relationship of options and rsus to reflect a 5050 allocation of the economic value for 2007 longterm incentive grants which hewitt advised continued to further align with market practice 

the committee’s decision regarding the 2007 equity grant mix also took into account the limited availability of shares for use under the shareholderapproved option program existing at that time if the optionsrsus mix continued unchanged from 2006 there likely would not have been enough shares for equity grants through fiscal 2008 the year the plan was scheduled to terminate by its terms the committee believed the best way to address that issue while also assisting with retention and motivation of neos and maintaining alignment with shareholder interests was to adjust the optionsrsus grant mix 

in connection with the merger all outstanding equity awards became fully vested and were settled in cash canceled or rolled over as described below unless they elected to roll over their existing options each neo received in exchange for each option an amount in cash without interest and less applicable withholding taxes equal to 2200 less the exercise price of each option additionally each neo received in exchange for each rsu or share of restricted stock an amount in cash without interest and less applicable withholding taxes equal to 2200 

 

certain neos elected to roll over their existing options in connection with the merger the “rollover options” the exercise price of the rollover options and the number of shares underlying the rollover options were adjusted as a result of the merger to provide their premerger value equivalents the rollover options otherwise continue under the terms of the equity plan under which they were issued 

on july 6 2007 our board adopted the 2007 stock incentive plan for key employees the “2007 plan” for certain designated employees including neos the board required a personal financial investment in dollar general in order for the employee to be eligible to receive an option grant under the 2007 plan that investment could be made in the form of cash rollover of stock andor rollover of inthemoney options issued prior to the merger each neo other than mr perdue who resigned and mr dreiling who is discussed separately below met the personal investment requirement and accordingly received option grants under the 2007 plan 

the options granted under the 2007 plan are divided so that half are timevested and half are performancevested based on a comparison of an ebitdabased performance metric as described below against preset goals for that performance metric the combination of time and performance based vesting of these awards is designed to compensate executives for longterm commitment to us while motivating sustained increases in our financial performance the options have an exercise price of 5 per share which was the fair market value on the grant date 

the timevested options vest and become exercisable ratably on each of the five anniversary dates of july 6 2007 solely based upon continued employment with us over that time period the performancevested options are eligible to vest and become exercisable ratably if the board determines in good faith that we achieve specified annual performance targets based on ebitda and adjusted as described below for fiscal 2007 that target was 700 million which was based on our annual financial plan and anticipated permitted adjustments primarily to account for unique expenses related to the merger and costs associated with project alpha if a performance target for a given fiscal year is not met the performancebased options may still vest and become exercisable on a “catch up” basis if at the end of a subsequent fiscal year through fiscal 2012 a specified cumulative ebitdabased performance target is achieved because the performance targets are based on our longterm financial plan we believe these levels while attainable require strong performance and execution we consider these performance targets to be slightly more difficult to achieve than financial performance targets associated with teamshare compensation in prior years 

for purposes of calculating performance targets for our longterm incentive program “ebitda” means earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization plus transaction management andor similar fees paid to kkr andor its affiliates in addition the board is required to fairly and appropriately adjust the calculation of ebitda to reflect to the extent not contemplated in our financial plan the following acquisitions divestitures any change required by generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” relating to sharebased compensation or for other changes in gaap promulgated by accounting standard setters that in each case the board in good faith determines require adjustment to the ebitda performance metric we use for our longterm incentive program for 2007 performance targets the board also is required to 

 

make a good faith determination of adjustments to ebitda for project alpha costs and other nonrecurring expenses after consulting with the ceo and cfo adjustments to ebitda for purposes of calculating performance targets or our longterm incentive program may not in all circumstances be identical to adjustments to ebitda for other purposes including our teamshare targets and the covenants contained in our principal financial agreements accordingly comparability of such measures is limited 

in march 2008 the compensation committee determined that the specified adjusted ebitda performance target had been achieved for fiscal 2007 and as a result acknowledged the vesting of 20 of the performancebased options 

benefits and perquisites we provide benefits and limited perquisites to neos for retention and recruiting purposes to promote tax efficiency for the neos and to replace benefit opportunities lost due to regulatory limits we also provide neos with benefits and perquisites as additional forms of compensation that are believed to be consistent and competitive with benefits and perquisites provided to similar positions in our market comparator group and our industry the compensation committee believed these benefits and perquisites help to attract and retain neos along with certain benefits offered to neos on the same terms that are offered to all of our salaried employees such as health and welfare benefits and matching contributions under our 401k plan we provide neos with certain additional benefits and perquisites 

we allow neos to participate in the compensation deferral plan the “cdp” and the defined contribution supplemental executive retirement plan the “serp” and together with the cdp the “cdpserp plan” during his tenure with us mr perdue was eligible to participate in the cdp but not the serp due to his participation in an individual defined benefit supplemental executive retirement plan mr perdue’s defined benefit supplemental executive retirement plan was provided as part of mr perdue’s inducement package to join dollar general in 2003 and was one of the compensation components necessary at that time to attract him to serve as our ceo in addition in january 2006 our board approved the establishment of a grantor trust to hold certain assets in connection with mr perdue’s supplemental executive retirement plan in the event of a change in control 

we provide each neo a life insurance benefit equal to 25 times his or her base salary to a maximum of 3 million we pay the premiums and gross up the neo’s income to pay the tax cost of this benefit we also provide each neo a disability insurance benefit that provides income replacement of 60 of base salary up to a maximum monthly benefit of 20000 25000 for mr perdue we pay the cost of this benefit and gross up the neo’s income to pay the tax cost of this benefit to the extent necessary to replace benefit level caps in the group plan applicable to all salaried employees 

each neo may choose either a leased automobile or a fixed monthly automobile allowance all neos except mr beré and ms lowe chose the automobile allowance option in 2007 mr beré and ms lowe chose the lease option under which we provide a companyleased automobile pay for gasoline repairs service and insurance and provide a grossup payment to pay the tax cost of the imputed income 

we also provide a relocation assistance program to neos similar to that offered to certain other employees in 2007 we incurred relocation expenses in accordance with this policy for mr buley and mr dreiling as discussed below in “compensation of mr dreiling” the significant differences of the relocation assistance available to neos from the relocation assistance available to other employees are as follows 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as an exception to the neo relocation policy the committee extended the temporary housing benefit in 2007 to mr beré beyond the 60 day limit due to uncertainties arising from the merger 

compensation of mr perdue 

while mr perdue’s compensation reflected an emphasis on achieving both short and longterm performance results more emphasis was placed on longterm performance goals this is generally typical for ceo compensation structures as it aligns their compensation more directly with that of shareholders ie the creation of longterm economic value in the company as a result of the risk associated with the longterm component being such a large portion of his total compensation and as a part of the decision to extend mr perdue’s employment contract with us his compensation was benchmarked closer to the 75 th percentile of the market comparator group 

in 2007 the committee reviewed mr perdue’s assessment of his overall performance to determine as a threshold matter his eligibility for a base salary increase this review included mr perdue’s performance versus his previously established 2006 goals which included measures relating to the sell off of inventory and the closing of stores as a part of project alpha increasing the discipline in the planning and buying process including private label development and sku rationalization enhanced domestic sourcing and continued reduction of costs through the supply chain enhancing the customer experience in the store through shrink reduction reduced store manager turnover and the development of measurements of store standards and the development of a store strategic growth plan because the committee was satisfied with mr perdue’s overall performance he was eligible for a 2007 salary increase 

the committee also reviewed hewitt’s benchmarking data as described above and considered certain provisions contained in the merger agreement limiting the aggregate employee base salary increase pool to no more than 3 hewitt’s data showed that mr perdue’s existing base salary with a 3 increase would continue to approximate market median and the committee determined that mr perdue would receive a 3 base salary increase for 2007 

the process followed in determining mr perdue’s 2007 teamshare structure and 2007 longterm incentives was substantially similar to that described above regarding other neos except that the ultimate decisions were made by the independent directors of the board upon committee recommendation in addition the board and the committee were contractually bound by the target 100 and maximum 200 teamshare payout percentages contained in mr perdue’s employment agreement approved prior to 2007 

with respect to mr perdue’s longterm incentive compensation the committee chose to use the same 5050 optionsrsus allocation of economic value as it used for other neos in 2007 hewitt’s benchmarking data indicated that the amounts to be granted to mr perdue would approximate the 75 th percentile of our market comparator group keeping his total direct compensation near the same percentile in connection with the merger mr perdue’s outstanding equity awards became fully vested and were settled in cash in the same manner described for the other neos 

mr perdue resigned from dollar general effective july 6 2007 we treated the resignation as one for “good reason” after a changeincontrol under his employment agreement he executed a release and became entitled to certain severance payments and benefits which are triggered by such a resignation under his employment agreement subject to his continued compliance with certain terms including restrictive covenants of the employment agreement he was also entitled to payments under his defined benefit supplemental executive retirement plan and the cdp 

compensation of mr dreiling 

mr dreiling entered into a fiveyear employment agreement to become ceo and a member of our board effective january 21 2008 key compensatory provisions of the agreement include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mr dreiling was chosen for the ceo position after a lengthy and careful search the board firmly believes he is the right leader for the company as we move forward the terms of his employment agreement summarized above were settled after negotiation with mr dreiling and the board believes that they are fair and appropriate given ceo compensation and benefits at comparable companies and given mr dreiling’s experience and leadership ability these arrangements were also necessary to entice mr dreiling to resign from his previous employer and to give him the opportunity to offset the potential financial gain he would be foregoing by leaving that employer 

severance and changeincontrol agreements 

as noted above we have employment agreements with our neos that among other things provide for each neo’s rights upon a termination of employment we believe that reasonable severance and changeincontrol benefits are appropriate to protect the neo against circumstances over which he or she does not have control and as consideration for the promises of noncompetition nonsolicitation and noninterference that we require in our employment agreements furthermore we believe changeincontrol severance payments align neo and shareholder interests by enabling neos to evaluate a transaction in the best interests of our shareholders and our other constituents without undue concern over whether the transaction may jeopardize the neo’s own employment 

all of our changeincontrol provisions operate under a double trigger requiring both a changeincontrol and a termination event except for the provisions related to longterm equity incentives under our 2007 plan under the 2007 plan 1 all timevested options will vest and become immediately exercisable as to 100 of the shares of common stock subject to such options immediately prior to a changeincontrol and 2 all performance–vested options will 

 

vest and become immediately exercisable as to 100 of the shares of common stock subject to such options immediately prior to a changeincontrol if as a result of the change–incontrol x investment funds affiliated with kkr realize a specified internal rate of return on 100 of their aggregate investment directly or indirectly in our equity securities the “sponsor shares” and y the investment funds affiliated with kkr earn a specified cash return on 100 of the sponsor shares provided however that in the event that a changeincontrol occurs in which more than 50 but less than 100 of our common stock or other voting securities or the common stock or other voting securities of buck holdings lp is sold or otherwise disposed of then the performancevested options will become vested up to the same percentage of sponsor shares on which investment funds affiliated with kkr achieve a specified internal rate of return on their aggregate investment and earn a specified return on their sponsor shares the merger constituted a changeincontrol for purposes of our premerger plans and arrangements 

deductibility of neo compensation 

section 162m of the internal revenue code generally disallows a tax deduction to public companies for compensation over 1 million paid in any fiscal year to an neo that is not performancebased compensation we believe that compensation paid in 2007 associated with stock options under our 1998 stock incentive plan would generally be fully deductible for federal income tax purposes however in certain situations such as timevested rsus the compensation committee approved compensation that did not meet these requirements in order to ensure competitive levels of total compensation for our neos because our common stock is no longer publicly traded the board did not consider section 162m with respect to 2007 compensation paid after the merger 

compensation committee report 

our compensation committee has reviewed and discussed with management the compensation discussion and analysis required by item 402b of regulation sk and based on such review and discussions the compensation committee recommended to the board that the compensation discussion and analysis be included in this document

grants of planbased awards during fiscal 2007 

the table below sets forth information regarding grants of planbased awards to our neos in fiscal 2007 the grants include rsus and options granted pursuant to our 1998 stock incentive plan in fiscal 2007 prior to the merger all of which became fully vested and were 

 

 

 

 

 

the rollover options are set forth in the table as separate grants the amounts paid as consideration for the rollover options as noted in the footnotes to the table represent the value the neo would have received in the merger had the neo instead chosen to accept the merger consideration while the exercise price and the number of shares underlying the rollover options have been adjusted as a result of the merger and are fully vested they are deemed to have been granted and otherwise continue under the terms of our 1998 stock incentive plan which is the plan under which the original options were issued 

the table also includes options granted in 2007 on or after the merger under our 2007 stock incentive plan we have omitted the columns for threshold and maximum estimated future payouts under equity incentive plan awards because they are inapplicable 

each neo’s annual teamshare bonus opportunity established for fiscal 2007 also is set forth in the table below actual bonus amounts earned by each neo for fiscal 2007 as a result of our ebitda performance are set forth in the summary compensation table above and represent prorated payment on a graduated scale between the target and maximum ebitda performance levels for each of the neos other than mr beré whose payment was not made on a graduated scale but rather represented payment at the target level mr perdue did not receive a

option exercises and stock vested during fiscal 2007 

the table below provides information regarding the value realized by our neos upon the transfer for value of stock options and the vesting of stock awards during fiscal 2007 

 

 

 

pension benefits 

fiscal 2007 

we provided retirement benefits to mr perdue under an unfunded nonqualified defined benefit pension plan or serp as a result of the merger which constituted a changeincontrol under the terms of the serp and the related grantor trust agreement and mr perdue’s resignation effective july 6 2007 mr perdue became 100 vested in his serp account and the actuarial equivalent of the lump sum value of mr perdue’s accrued benefit was funded to the grantor trust the material terms of mr perdue’s serp are discussed following the table 

 

 

 

mr perdue’s serp provided for an annual normal retirement benefit equal to 25 of “final average compensation” upon retirement on or after his “normal retirement date” payable as a joint and 50 spouse annuity assuming his spouse to be the same age as mr perdue mr perdue could elect to receive his benefit as a lump sum or any annuity form actuarially equivalent to the normal retirement benefit the serp also provided for an early retirement benefit which would reduce his benefit by 5 for each year or portion thereof that mr perdue retired prior to age 60 

for the purpose of calculating mr perdue’s accumulated benefit “normal retirement date” is the first of the month coincident with or next following the later of the date mr perdue attains age 60 or is credited with 15 years of credited service since mr perdue was not age 60 on the date of his resignation his benefit under the serp was treated as an early retirement and his benefit was reduced accordingly 

mr perdue’s benefit was based on a total of 14 out of a possible 15 years of credited service under the serp plan this included 8 years of credited service based on his actual service under the plan in which he received 2 years of credited service upon each anniversary of his date of hire and an additional 6 years of credited service since his resignation was for good reason within 2 years of a changeincontrol 

“final average compensation” is calculated as mr perdue’s base salary plus his “applicable annual bonus” for the highest 3 consecutive fiscal years of credited service “applicable annual bonus” is the greater of the actual bonus paid for the immediately preceding fiscal year or the target annual bonus for the current fiscal year mr perdue’s base salary and “applicable annual bonus” were assumed to have been paid during the additional years of credited service for the purpose of calculating his “final average compensation” for the purpose of his benefit calculation mr perdue’s final average compensation was 2266000 

we had established a grantor trust that provided for assets to fund mr perdue’s serp to be placed in the trust upon a changeincontrol as defined in the grantor trust of dollar general the trust’s assets were subject to the claims of our creditors the trust also provided for a distribution to mr perdue to pay certain taxes in the event he was taxed in connection with the funding of the trust and to apply interest at the rate of 6 per annum in the event payment was delayed due to section 409a of the code as a result of the merger and since the payment was determined to be subject to section 409a delay a deposit of 6208966 was made to the trust representing the lump sum and interest value of mr perdue’s benefit this amount was paid to mr perdue on january 7 2008 

nonqualified deferred compensation 

fiscal 2007 

we offer a cdpserp plan to certain key employees including the neos mr perdue was not eligible to participate in the serp portion of the cdpserp plan due to his participation in his individualized serp discussed under “pension benefits” above information regarding the neos’ participation in the cdpserp plan is included in the following table the material terms of the cdpserp plan are described after the table please also see “benefits and perquisites” in “compensation discussion and analysis” above 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pursuant to the cdp neos may annually elect to defer up to 65 of base salary and up to 100 of bonus pay we currently match base pay deferrals at a rate of 100 up to 5 of annual salary with annual salary offset by the amount of matcheligible salary under the 401k plan all neos are 100 vested in all compensation and matching deferrals and earnings on those deferrals

 

pursuant to the serp we make an annual contribution equal to a certain percentage of a participants annual salary and bonus to all participants who are actively employed in an eligible job grade on january 1 and continue to be employed as of december 31 of a given year the contribution percentage is based on age years of service and job grade the 2007 contribution percentage for each eligible neo was 75 for mr beré mr tehle ms guion and ms lowe and 45 for mr buley 

as a result of the merger which constituted a changeincontrol under the cdpserp plan all previously unvested serp amounts vested on july 6 2007 for newly eligible serp participants after july 6 2007 serp amounts vest at the earlier of the participants attainment of age 50 or the participants being credited with 10 or more years of service or upon termination of employment due to death or total and permanent disability or upon a “changeincontrol” all as defined in the cdpserp plan 

the amounts deferred or contributed to the cdpserp plan are credited to a liability account which is then invested at the participants option in either an account that mirrors the performance of a fund or funds selected by the compensation committee or its delegate the mutual fund options or prior to the merger in an account that mirrors the performance of our common stock the common stock option 

a participant who ceases employment with at least 10 years of service or after reaching age 50 and whose cdp account balance or serp account balance exceeds 25000 may elect for that account balance to be paid in cash by a lump sum b monthly installments over a 5 10 or 15year period or c a combination of lump sum and installments otherwise payment is made in a lump sum the vested amount will be payable at the time designated by the plan upon the participants termination of employment a participants cdpserp benefit normally is payable in the following february if employment ceases during the first 6 months of a calendar year or is payable in the following august if employment ceases during the last 6 months of a calendar year however participants may elect to receive an inservice lump sum distribution of vested amounts credited to the cdp account provided that the date of distribution is no sooner than 5 years after the end of the year in which the amounts were deferred in addition a participant who is actively employed may request an unforeseeable emergency hardship inservice lump sum distribution of vested amounts credited to the participant’s cdp account account balances deemed to be invested in the mutual fund options are payable in cash and prior to the merger account balances deemed to be invested in the common stock option were payable in shares of dollar general common stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares 

  

as a result of the merger the cdpserp plan liabilities were fully funded into an irrevocable rabbi trust all account balances deemed to be invested in the common stock option were liquidated at a value of 2200 per share and the proceeds were transferred to an existing investment option within the plan 

potential payments upon termination or changeincontrol 

the tables below reflect potential payments to each of our neos in various termination and changeincontrol scenarios based on compensation benefit and equity levels in effect on february 1 2008 the amounts shown assume that the termination or changeincontrol event was effective as of february 1 2008 for stock valuations we have assumed that the price per share is the fair market value of our stock on february 1 2008 500 the amounts shown are merely estimates we cannot determine the actual amounts to be paid until the time of a changeincontrol or the neos termination of employment 

since mr perdue resigned effective july 6 2007 he did not have a right to any payments as of february 1 2008 we agreed to treat this resignation as one for good reason after a changein control as defined in his employment agreement therefore the table below presents mr perdue’s actual payments in connection with his resignation the other forms of termination do not apply and are marked as “na” or not applicable 

payments regardless of manner of termination 

regardless of the termination scenario the neos other than mr perdue will receive earned but unpaid base salary through the employment termination date along with any other benefits owed under any of our plans or agreements covering the neo as governed by the terms of those plans or agreements these benefits include vested amounts in the cdpserp plan discussed above after the nonqualified deferred compensation table 

upon mr perdues resignation on july 6 2007 he received payment equal to his earned but unpaid base salary through his employment termination date any accrued expenses and vacation pay this payment was made in accordance with our normal payroll cycle and procedures he also received timely payment or provision for any other accrued amounts or benefits required to be paid for which he was eligible under any of our plans practices or agreements these benefits include amounts payable pursuant to his serp described above after the pension benefits table and his cdp benefit discussed above in detail after the nonqualified deferred compensation table 

the tables below exclude any amounts payable to the neo to the extent that they are available generally to all salaried employees and do not discriminate in favor of our executive officers 

payments upon termination due to retirement 

mr perdue’s resignation on july 6 2007 was treated under the terms of his serp as a changeincontrol termination and an early retirement mr perdues serp benefit and the enhancement of that benefit as a result of his retirement are discussed above after the pension benefits table 

except for mr perdue retirement is not treated differently from any other voluntary termination under any of our plans or agreements for neos except that all rollover options will remain exercisable for a period of 3 years following the neo’s retirement unless the options expire earlier to be entitled to the extended exercise period for the rollover options the retirement must occur on or after the neo reaches the age of 65 or with our express consent prior to age 65 in accordance with any applicable early retirement policy then in effect or as may be approved by our compensation committee 

payments upon termination due to death or disability 

in the event of death or disability with respect to each neo 

 

 

 

 

 

in the event of mr dreiling’s death or disability his restricted stock will vest and in the event of disability he will receive a prorated bonus payment based on our performance for the fiscal year paid at the time bonuses are normally paid for that fiscal year 

in the event of death the neos beneficiary will receive payments under our group life insurance program in an amount up to a maximum of 3 million equal to 25 times the neos annual base salary we have excluded from the tables below amounts that the neo would receive under our disability insurance program since the same benefit level is provided to all of our salaried employees the neos cdpserp plan benefit also becomes fully vested and is payable in a lump sum within 60 days after the end of the calendar quarter in which the neos death occurs 

in the event of disability the neo’s cdpserp plan benefit becomes fully vested and is payable in a lump sum within 60 days after the end of the calendar quarter in which we receive notification of the determination of the neos disability by the social security administration 

for purposes of the neos employment agreements disability means the that employee must be disabled for purposes of our longterm disability insurance plan for purposes of the cdpserp plan “disability” means total and permanent disability for purposes of entitlement to social security disability benefits 

payments upon voluntary termination 

the payments to be made to an neo upon voluntary termination vary depending upon whether the neo resigns with or without good reason or after our failure to offer to renew extend or replace the neos employment agreement under certain circumstances for purposes of each neo good reason generally means as more fully described in the applicable employment agreement 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no event will constitute good reason if we cure the claimed event within 30 days after receiving notice from the neo 

voluntary termination with good reason or after failure to renew the employment agreement if the neo 1 resigns with good reason or 2 in the case of neos other than mr dreiling within 60 days of our failure to offer to renew extend or replace the neos employment agreement before at or within 60 days after the end of the agreements term unless we enter into a mutually acceptable severance arrangement or the resignation is a result of the neos voluntary retirement or termination or 3 in the case of mr dreiling in the event we elect not to extend the term of his employment by providing 60 days prior written notice before the applicable extension date 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subject to any applicable prohibition on acceleration of payment under section 409a of the internal revenue code we may at any time and in our sole discretion elect to make a lumpsum payment of all these amounts other than mr dreiling’s medical dental and vision benefit continuation or all remaining amounts due as a result of this type of termination 

the neo will forfeit any unpaid severance amounts upon a material breach of any continuing obligation under the employment agreement or the release which include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

voluntary termination without good reason if the neo resigns without good reason he or she will forfeit all unvested equity grants and all vested options granted in connection with the merger rollover options generally may be exercised for 3 months from the termination date unless they expire earlier or unless we repurchase them at a per share price equal to the lesser of x fair market value minus the exercise price and y the sum of base price and applicable percentage minus the exercise price 

payments upon involuntary termination 

the payments to be made to an neo upon involuntary termination vary depending upon whether termination is for or without cause for purposes of each neo cause generally means as more fully described in the applicable employment agreement 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for purposes of determining treatment of an neo’s rollover options “cause” means to the extent that our compensation committee determines that it is directly and materially harmful to our business or reputation 

 

 

 

involuntary termination for cause if the neo is involuntarily terminated for cause he or she will forfeit all unvested equity grants as well as all vested but unexercised options however we may repurchase all rollover options at a per share price equal to the lesser of x base price over the exercise price and y fair market value over the exercise price 

involuntary termination without cause if the neo is involuntarily terminated without cause the neos equity grants will be treated as described under voluntary termination with good reason or after failure to renew the employment agreement above in addition each neo will receive the applicable payments and benefits listed under voluntary termination with good reason or after failure to renew the employment agreement above 

payments after a changeincontrol 

upon a changeincontrol regardless of whether the neo’s employment terminates 

 

 

 

if the neo other than messrs perdue dreiling or beré is involuntarily terminated without cause or resigns for good reason within 2 years of a changeincontrol he or she will receive upon execution of a release of certain claims against us and our affiliates in the form attached to the neos employment agreement a lump sum payment equal to 2 times the neos annual base salary plus 2 times the neos target incentive bonus each as in effect immediately prior to the changeincontrol plus 2 times our annual contribution for the neos participation in our medical dental and vision benefits program the neo also will receive outplacement services at our expense for 1 year or if earlier until other employment is secured 

for messrs dreiling and beré an involuntary termination following a changeincontrol event will be treated in the same manner as a “voluntary termination with good reason or after failure to renew the employment agreement” as described above 

if any payments or benefits in connection with a changeincontrol would be subject to the excise tax under federal income tax rules we will pay an additional amount to the neo to cover the excise tax and any resulting taxes however if after receiving this payment the neos 

 

aftertax benefit is not at least 25000 more than it would be without this payment then it will not be made and the severance and other benefits due will be reduced so that an excise tax is not incurred 

for purposes of the cdpserp plan and the employment agreements of mr tehle mr buley ms guion and ms lowe a changeincontrol generally is deemed to occur as more fully described in those documents 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for purposes of the treatment of equity discussed above a changeincontrol generally means as more fully described in the management stockholder’s agreement between us and the neos in one or a series of related transactions 

 

 

 

 

 

because mr perdue’s resignation occurred within 2 years of the merger which constituted a changeincontrol under his employment agreement and the plan under which his equity awards were granted he received the following benefits under his employment agreement and other plans in which he participated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mr perdue is subject to the following business protection provisions

compensation committee interlocks and insider participation 

each of dennis bottorff reginald dickson and gordon gee was a member of our compensation committee during fiscal 2007 prior to the merger we did not have a compensation committee or another board committee that performed equivalent functions for the remaining portion of fiscal 2007 none of these persons was at any time during fiscal 2007 an officer or employee of dollar general or any of our subsidiaries or an officer of dollar general or any of our subsidiaries at any time prior to fiscal 2007 none of these persons had any relationship with dollar general or any of our subsidiaries requiring disclosure under any paragraph of item 404 of regulation sk during the period that these persons served on the committee as a board member david l beré was entitled to participate in board deliberations regarding executive compensation other than his own that occurred during the portion of fiscal 2007 after the merger none of our executive officers served as a member of a compensation committee or as a director of any entity of which any of our directors served as an executive officer during fiscal 2007

b   director compensation the following tables and text discuss the compensation of persons who served as a member of our board of directors during all or part of fiscal 2007 other than richard w dreiling david l beré and david a perdue each of whose compensation is discussed under “executive compensation” above and who was not separately compensated for board service 

fiscal 2007 director compensation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

narrative to fiscal 2007 director compensation table 

the following discussion of fiscal 2007 director compensation encompasses compensation of the director group who served before the merger as well as the director group who served after the merger each group can be identified by reference to the 1 st footnote to the director compensation table above 

prior to the merger we used a combination of cash and stockbased incentive compensation to attract and retain qualified board candidates subsequent to the merger our compensation structure includes only cash for both periods we did not compensate for board service any director who was also a dollar general employee 

cash compensation prior to the merger we paid nonemployee directors two quarterly installments of the annual cash retainer and the per meeting attendance fees set forth below we also paid two quarterly installments of the following additional annual retainers to each committee chairman and to the presiding director 

 

to assist in understanding the fees actually earned by each nonemployee director prior to the merger the following chart shows information regarding committee service and meeting attendance of each premerger director 

 

we reimbursed directors for certain fees and expenses incurred in connection with continuing education seminars and travel expenses related to dollar general meeting attendance or requested appearances we allowed directors and spouses for no additional incremental cost to travel on the dollar general airplane for those purposes 

subsequent to the merger cash fees payable to our nonemployee directors consist solely of a 40000 annual retainer fee payable in quarterly installments directors also are entitled to receive the expense reimbursements discussed above because the postmerger directors served on our board for only a portion of fiscal 2007 those directors received onethird of the second quarter retainer fee along with two full quarterly installments of the retainer fee 

  

equity compensation each nonemployee director who served on our board prior to the merger received 4600 rsus in fiscal 2007 pursuant to the automatic grant provisions of our 1998 stock incentive plan each rsu represented the right to receive one share of dollar general common stock 

in accordance with the terms of our 1998 stock incentive plan we credited dividend equivalents to the director’s rsu account as additional rsus whenever we declared a cash dividend on our common stock directors did not have voting rights with respect to rsus until the underlying shares of common stock were issued rsus generally vested one year after the grant date if the director was still serving on our board we did not however make payment on vested rsus until the director ceased to be a member of our board under the terms of the 1998 stock incentive plan vesting of the rsus accelerated upon termination of a director’s board service due to a variety of reasons including upon a changeincontrol of dollar general because the merger constituted a changeincontrol under our 1998 stock incentive plan all outstanding rsus vested and were settled in cash in the merger 

prior to june 2 2003 we also annually granted nonqualified stock options to our nonemployee directors under certain stock incentive plans all of those options have since fully vested and pursuant to the merger were settled in cash if inthemoney or cancelled 

  

immediately following the merger we ceased making equity grants to our nonemployee directors as part of director compensation 

  

stock ownership guidelines in fiscal 2007 as a publicly held company we required each nonemployee director to own at least 13000 shares of our common stock within three years of joining our board rsus and stock options counted towards that requirement because we are now a privately held company we no longer maintain those stock ownership guidelines 

deferred compensation plan for nonemployee directors prior to the merger nonemployee directors could defer up to 100 of eligible compensation paid by us to them pursuant to a voluntary nonqualified deferred compensation plan for nonemployee directors eligible compensation included the annual retainers meeting fees and any per diem compensation for special assignments earned by a director for service to the board we credited the deferred compensation to a liability account which was then invested at the director’s option in one or more accounts that mirrored the performance of a funds selected by our compensation committee or its delegate or b our common stock 

  

all deferred compensation pursuant to the deferred compensation plan for nonemployee directors was immediately due and payable as a result of the merger which constituted a changeincontrol of dollar general under the terms of that plan 

  

our board elected to terminate the deferred compensation plan for nonemployee directors effective as of december 31 2007

 item 13 

certain relationships and related transactions and director independence 

tableend 

a   director independence postmerger the members of our board of directors are michael m calbert raj agrawal adrian jones dean b nelson and richard w dreiling messrs calbert and agrawal serve on our audit committee and messrs calbert agrawal and jones serve on our compensation committee sumit rajpal served as a member of our board for a brief period following the merger and david beré served on our board until march 2008 though not formally considered by our board given that our securities are not registered or traded on any national securities exchange based upon the listing standards of the nyse on which our common stock was listed prior to the merger we do not believe that any of our current board members or messrs rajpal or beré would be considered independent either because they serve as members of our management team or because of their relationships with certain affiliates of the funds and other entities that hold significant interests in parent and other relationships with us as more fully described under “related party transactions” below 

 

accordingly we do not believe that any of our audit committee members would meet the independence requirements of rule 10a1 of the exchange act or the nyse’s audit committee independence requirements or that any of our compensation committee members would meet the nyse’s independence requirements we do not have a nominatingcorporate governance committee or a committee that serves a similar purpose 

b   director independence premerger  until the merger on july 6 2007 our board of directors at least annually considered each director’s independence in accordance with guidelines it had adopted which included all elements of independence set forth in the nyse listing standards as well as certain boardadopted categorical independence standards these guidelines were contained in our corporate governance principles or with respect to interests of less than 1 of a publicly held vendor in our code of business conduct and ethics and were last described in our form 10k for the fiscal year ended february 2 2007 

during fiscal 2007 but prior to the merger our board of directors consisted of david perdue david beré dennis bottorff barbara bowles reginald dickson gordon gee barbara knuckles neal purcell james robbins richard thornburgh and david wilds also during that time period our audit committee consisted of mr robbins mr bottorff ms bowles and mr purcell our compensation committee consisted of mr bottorff mr dickson and mr gee and our nominating and corporate governance committee consisted of mr wilds mr gee and ms knuckles our board of directors had affirmatively determined on march 20 2007 that directors bottorff bowles dickson gee knuckles purcell robbins thornburgh and wilds but not directors perdue or beré each of whom was a member of management were independent from our management under both the nyse’s listing standards and our additional categorical independence standards based on information known at that time any relationship between an independent director and dollar general or our management were either encompassed by the boardadopted categorical standards mentioned above or in the case of mr wilds’ relationship with a vendor deemed to be immaterial a table setting forth the transactions or relationships with our former directors that fell within a boardadopted categorical standard as well as a description of mr wilds’ relationships with a vendor was set forth in our form 10k for the fiscal year ended february 2 2007 because of the merger our board has not made any additional independence determinations with respect to those former board members 

c   related party transactions  we describe below the transactions that have occurred since the beginning of fiscal 2007 and any currently proposed transactions that involve dollar general and exceed 120000 and in which a related party had or has a direct or indirect material interest 

1 relationships with management  

management stockholder’s agreement  simultaneously with the closing of the merger and thereafter in connection with our offering equity awards to certain members of our management and other employees the “management participants” under our stock incentive plan including the equity grants to mr dreiling in connection with his offer of employment we parent and each of the management participants who held shares of our capital stock including through option exercises or who were granted new options to acquire our stock or 

 

in the case of mr dreiling who was granted shares of restricted common stock entered into a stockholder’s agreement the management stockholder’s agreement imposes significant transfer restrictions on shares of our common stock generally shares will be nontransferable by any means at any time prior to july 6 2012 except i sales pursuant to an effective registration statement filed by us under the securities act in accordance with the management stockholder’s agreement ii a sale pursuant to the sale participation agreement described below iii a sale to certain permitted transferees or iv as otherwise permitted by our board of directors or pursuant to a waiver given by the sponsor provided that in the event the sponsor or its affiliates transfer limited partnership units owned by them to a third party such transfer restrictions shall lapse with respect to the same proportion of shares of common stock owned by a management stockholder as the proportion of limited partnership units transferred by the sponsor and such affiliates relative to the aggregate number of limited partnership units owned by them prior to that transfer 

in the event that a management stockholder wishes to sell his or her stock at any time after july 6 2012 but before the earlier of a “change in control” as defined in the management stockholder’s agreement or the consummation of a “qualified public offering” as defined in the management stockholder’s agreement the management stockholder’s agreement provides us with a right of first refusal on those shares on the same terms and conditions that the management stockholder proposes to sell them to a third party in the event that a registration statement is filed with respect to our common stock in the future the management stockholder’s agreement prohibits management stockholders from selling shares not included in the registration statement from the time of receipt of notice that we have filed or intend to file such registration statement until 180 days in the case of an initial public offering or 90 days in the case of any other public offering of the effective date of the registration statement the management stockholder’s agreement also provides for the management stockholder’s ability to cause us to repurchase his outstanding stock and vested options and vested restricted stock with respect to mr dreiling in the event of the management stockholder’s death or disability and for our ability to cause the management stockholder to sell his stock or options back to us upon certain termination events mr dreiling also has the ability to cause us to repurchase his vested restricted stock if any if he resigns for any reason within six months after january 21 2008 in addition under the terms of the management stockholder’s agreement each senior management stockholder as defined below has the ability to cause us to repurchase prior to the later of x july 6 2008 and y the last day of the sixmonth period after mr dreiling was hired all of the shares of common stock and all of the options they rolled over in connection with the merger that such management stockholder then holds if such management stockholder resigns or is terminated within such time frame 

following the initial public offering of our common stock certain members of senior management including the executive officers the “senior management stockholders” will have limited “piggyback” registration rights with respect to their shares in the event that certain of the investors are selling or causing to be sold shares of common stock in such offering 

sale participation agreement  each management participant including mr dreiling also has entered into a sale participation agreement with parent the sale participation agreement grants the senior management stockholders the right to participate in any private sale of shares of common stock by parent or its affiliates the “tagalong right” and requires all management stockholders to participate in the private 

 

sale if parent elects in the event that parent or its affiliates are proposing to sell at least 50 of the outstanding shares of common stock held by it the “dragalong right” the number of shares a management stockholder would be permitted or required as applicable to sell pursuant to the exercise of the tagalong right or the dragalong right is equal to the number of shares then owned by the management stockholder and his or her affiliates plus all shares that person is entitled to acquire under unexercised options to the extent exercisable at that time or as a result of the consummation of the proposed sale and also with respect to dragalong rights pertaining to mr dreiling unvested shares of restricted stock that would vest upon consummation of the transaction multiplied by a fraction x the numerator of which is the aggregate number of shares parent proposes to transfer in the proposed sale and y the denominator of which is the total number of shares parent directly or indirectly owns management stockholders will bear the pro rata share of any fees commissions adjustments to purchase price expenses or indemnities in connection with any sale under the sale participation agreement 

equity investment by senior management participants  in connection with the merger certain members of our management the “senior management participants” were offered the opportunity to roll over portions of their equity andor options and to purchase additional equity of dollar general in connection with such investment and the merger we adopted a new stock incentive plan pursuant to which these individuals were granted new options with respect to additional shares of our common stock messrs beré tehle buley and gibson and mss guion lanigan lowe and elliott each invested a total of 224999500 79999625 75486375 34870375 65000750 51602625 52665000 and 24999750 respectively any shares purchased or otherwise acquired by these senior management participants as described above including any shares subject to roll over options or acquired upon exercise thereof are subject to certain transfer limitations and repurchase rights by dollar general we also offered other employees a similar investment opportunity to participate in our common equity

overall business strategy 

our mission is “serving others” to carry out this mission we have developed a business strategy of providing our customers with a focused assortment of fairly priced consumable merchandise in a convenient smallstore format

our customers  we serve the basic consumable needs of customers primarily in the low and middleincome brackets and those on fixed incomes according to ac nielsen’s 2006 homescan® data in 2006 approximately 41 of our customers had gross income of less than 30000 per year and approximately 24 had gross income of less than 20000 per year our merchandising and operating strategies are primarily designed to meet the need for basic consumable products of consumers in these lower income groups

our stores  the traditional dollar general store has on average approximately 6900 square feet of selling space and generally serves customers who live within five miles of the store of our 8260 stores operating as of march 2 2007 approximately 4750 serve communities with populations of 20000 or less we believe that our target customers prefer the convenience of a small neighborhood store we believe that our convenient discount store format will continue to attract customers and provide us with a competitive advantage 

in 2003 we began testing a dollar general market® store concept dollar general markets are larger than the average dollar general store and carry among other items an expanded assortment of grocery products and perishable items at march 2 2007 our 8260 total stores included 56 dollar general market stores with an average of approximately 17250 square feet of selling space

our merchandise  we are committed to offering a focused assortment of quality consumable merchandise in a number of core categories such as health and beauty aids packaged food and refrigerated products home cleaning supplies housewares stationery seasonal goods basic clothing and domestics this focused merchandise assortment allows customers to shop at dollar general stores for their everyday household needs in 2006 the average customer purchase was 931

our prices  we distribute quality consumable merchandise at everyday low prices our strategy of a lowcost operating structure and a focused assortment of merchandise allows us to offer quality merchandise at competitive prices as part of this strategy we emphasize evendollar prices on many of our items in the typical dollar general store the majority of the products are priced at 10 or less with approximately 30 of the products priced at 1 or less 

our cost controls  we emphasize aggressive management of our overhead cost structure additionally we seek to locate stores in neighborhoods where rental and operating costs are relatively low we attempt to control operating costs by implementing new technology where feasible examples of this strategy in recent years include the implementation of “ezstore” our initiative designed to improve inventory flow from distribution centers “dcs” to consumers other improvements to our supply chain and warehousing systems an automatic 

inventory replenishment system at the store level the implementation of a new merchandise planning system designed to assist our merchants with their purchasing and store allocation decisions enhancements and improvements to the inventory replenishment and merchandise planning systems and the reengineering of our opentobuy inventory procurement process

recent strategic initiatives 

in the fourth quarter of 2006 we launched certain strategic initiatives related to our merchandising and real estate strategies based upon a comprehensive analysis of the performance of each of our stores and the impact of our inventory model on our ability to effectively serve our customers 

with regard to merchandising we reviewed our historic inventory management strategies changes in recent years to those practices and the potential impact on future profitability of an acceleration of our transition away from some of those practices under our traditional inventory disposition strategy we carried forward any remaining prior season inventory “packaway” and attempted to adjust future inventory purchases to account for the carryover product beginning in the fourth quarter of 2003 principally at the conclusion of the holiday selling season we began taking endofseason markdowns materially in excess of markdowns that had been taken historically to attempt to accelerate the disposition of certain holidayrelated items as well as certain other seasonal home and basic clothing items that had not sold as expected although these increased endofseason markdowns resulted in less packaway inventory there continued to be a packaway component of our merchandising practices and a significant amount of merchandise from prior seasons remained in many stores based on our review we decided to discontinue our traditional inventory packaway management model in an attempt to better meet our customers’ needs and to ensure an appealing fresh merchandise selection we are currently in the process of executing that initiative as further discussed below under “merchandising initiatives”

we made significant improvements to the policies procedures and controls relating to our real estate practices during 2006 we have fully integrated the functions of site selection lease renewals relocations remodels and store closings and have defined and implemented additional criteria for decisionmaking in those areas we continue to analyze our real estate performance and to look for ways to further refine and improve our practices as a first step in our initiative to revitalize our store base we plan to close approximately 400 underperforming stores by the end of fiscal 2007 including 151 stores that have already been closed as of march 2 2007 the closings are in addition to stores that might be closed in the normal course of business we will continue to evaluate our store base for additional closing candidates as part of our revitalization efforts we also are focusing on upgrading our existing store base with plans to decelerate our new store growth rate to enable us to remodel or relocate a number of stores to improve productivity and enhance the shopping experience for the customers in those stores we expect that these actions will result in better disciplined inventory management and a more productive store base

growth strategy 

we have experienced a rapid rate of expansion in recent years increasing our number of stores from 5540 as of february 1 2002 to 8260 as of march 2 2007 in addition to growth from new store openings we recorded samestore sales increases of 33 and 20 in 2006 and 2005 respectively samestore sales calculations for 2005 and prior include only those stores that were open both at the end of that period and at the beginning of the preceding fiscal year based on the comparable calendar weeks in the prior year as further described below in part ii item 7 2006 was a 52week accounting period while 2005 was a 53week accounting period accordingly the same store sales percentages discussed above exclude sales from the 53 rd week in 2005 as there was no comparable week in 2006 or 2004 we will continue to seek to grow our business and believe that this future growth will come from a combination of new store openings remodeled and relocated stores infrastructure investments and merchandising initiatives each as discussed more fully below

new store growth  we believe that our convenient smallstore format is adaptable to small towns and neighborhoods throughout the country the majority of our stores are located in these small towns which we define as communities with populations of 20000 or less in 2006 approximately half of our new stores were opened in small towns while the remainder were opened either in rural or in more densely populated areas we expect a similar mix of new store openings between small towns and other areas in 2007 new store openings in 2007 will include our existing market area as well as certain other geographic areas where management believes we have the potential to expand our store base as part of the strategic initiatives discussed above we plan to decrease the number of new store openings and increase the number of remodeled or relocated stores in 2007 opening or remodelingrelocating stores in our existing market area allows us to take advantage of brand awareness and to maximize our operating efficiencies

in 2006 2005 and 2004 we opened 537 734 and 722 new stores and remodeled or relocated 64 82 and 80 stores respectively in 2007 we plan to open approximately 300 new dollar general stores and plan to remodel or relocate an additional 300 stores 

infrastructure investments  our distribution network is an integral component of our efforts to reduce transportation expenses and effectively support our growth in recent years we have made significant investments in our distribution network as of march 2 2007 we operated nine dcs one of which opened during 2006 in recent years we have expanded our dcs in south boston virginia and ardmore oklahoma by completing the conversion of these dcs from single to dual sortation systems which enables them to serve more stores

we also have invested in technological improvements and upgrades in recent years in 2006 new systems for assortment planning merchandise allocations and drop ship receiving were installed we implemented improvements to our transportation sales audit loss prevention and planogram systems in addition we completed store system enhancements for promotions and coupons in 2005 we installed new systems for store operating statements store labor scheduling supplier communications and transportation and claims management in addition we enhanced our store systems to allow us to sell dollar general gift cards in 2004 we added a merchandising data warehouse completed the rollout of creditdebit and electronic benefit 

transfer capabilities and installed an automatic inventory replenishment system in all stores in addition we completed a new stock ledger and sales flash system also for the first time we equipped store district managers with personal computers to enable them to access daily merchandising information 

merchandising initiatives  our merchandising initiatives are designed to promote samestore sales increases we continually evaluate the performance of our merchandise mix and make adjustments when appropriate in recent years we have increased our emphasis on the highly consumable category by adding items in the food paper pet products household chemicals and health and beauty aids categories also in recent years we began offering perishable products which include a selection of dairy products luncheon meats frozen foods and ice cream other recent initiatives include prepaid phone cards and branded apparel

in the fourth quarter of 2006 we commenced execution of an initiative to discontinue our traditional inventory packaway management model in an attempt to better meet our customers’ needs and to ensure an appealing fresh merchandise selection with few exceptions we plan to eliminate through endofseason and other markdowns existing seasonal home products and basic clothing packaway merchandise by the end of fiscal 2007 in addition beginning in fiscal 2007 we plan to sell virtually all currentyear nonreplenishable merchandise by taking endofseason markdowns allowing for increased levels of newer currentseason merchandise we believe this strategy change will enhance the appearance of our stores and will positively impact customer satisfaction as well as the store employees’ ability to manage stores ultimately resulting in higher sales increased gross profit lower employee turnover and decreased inventory shrink and damages we also expect that this improved inventory management will result in more appropriate per store inventory levels

we expect to increase our sales mix of merchandise categories with higher gross profit rates such as home products basic clothing and seasonal merchandise as we become increasingly able to improve our merchandise assortments and stock our stores with more current inventory achievement of our goals is contingent upon this expected sales mix improvement as well as effective inventory management and reductions in inventory shrink and damages

in 2006 we initiated a new store layout that we believed would drive sales and improve our merchandising mix the new layout was launched in a test mode in early 2006 was further developed during the year and became our standard new store format by the end of 2006 through the process of opening new stores and reformatting a limited number of existing stores there were approximately 359 stores operating in this new format as of march 2 2007 the results have been encouraging as we have seen additional sales including increased sales of higher margin goods additionally improved merchandise adjacencies and wider more open aisles have enhanced the overall guest shopping experience

merchandise 

dollar general stores offer a focused assortment of quality merchandise in a number of core categories we operate as one reportable segment and separate our merchandise into the following four categories for reporting purposes highly consumable seasonal home products 

and basic clothing detailed information on our net sales by product class can be found in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this report

we maintain approximately 4900 core stockkeeping units “skus” per store

for the preceding three years the percentage of total sales of each of the four categories we track is as follows

 

of the four categories the home products and seasonal categories typically account for the highest gross profit rates and the highly consumable category typically accounts for the lowest gross profit rate 

we purchase our merchandise from a wide variety of suppliers approximately 11 of our purchases in 2006 were from the procter  gamble company our next largest supplier accounted for approximately 5 of our purchases in 2006 we directly imported approximately 14 of our retail receipts in 2006 

through 2005 we generally did not use advertising circulars widely throughout our network of stores instead we advertised to support new traditional store openings primarily with targeted circulars and instore signage in 2006 we used several advertising circulars in an attempt to increase sales and customer traffic additionally during 2006 we advertised on both television and radio advertising expenses remained less than 1 of sales in 2005 we initiated a marketing program as the sponsor of a national association for stock car auto racing “nascar” busch series car which continued in 2006 during 2005 and 2006 we participated in the busch series racing season which ran from february to november and served as the title sponsor of the dollar general 300 nascar busch series race at lowe’s motor speedway in concord north carolina 

seasonality 

our business is modestly seasonal in nature we expect to continue to experience seasonal fluctuations with a larger percentage of our net sales operating profit and net income being realized in the fourth quarter in addition our quarterly results can be affected by the timing of new store openings and store closings the amount of sales contributed by new and existing stores as well as the timing of certain holidays we purchase substantial amounts of inventory in the third quarter and incur higher shipping costs and higher payroll costs in anticipation of the increased sales activity during the fourth quarter in addition we carry merchandise during our fourth quarter that we do not carry during the rest of the year such as gift sets holiday decorations certain baking items and a broader assortment of toys and candy

the following table reflects the seasonality of net sales operating profit and net income loss by quarter all of the quarters reflected below are comprised of 13 weeks with the exception of the fourth quarter of the year ended february 3 2006 which was comprised of 14 weeks

 

the dollar general store 

the typical dollar general store is operated by a manager an assistant manager and two or more sales clerks approximately 49 of our stores are located in strip shopping centers 49 are in freestanding buildings and 2 are in downtown buildings we generally have not encountered difficulty locating suitable store sites in the past and management does not currently anticipate experiencing material difficulty in finding suitable locations

our recent store growth is summarized in the following table

 

 employees 

as of march 2 2007 we employed approximately 69500 fulltime and parttime employees including divisional and regional managers district managers store managers and dc and administrative personnel compared with approximately 64500 employees on march 3 2006 management believes our relationship with our employees is generally good and we are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements

competition 

we operate in the discount retail merchandise business which is highly competitive with respect to price store location merchandise quality assortment and presentation instock consistency and customer service we compete with discount stores and with many other retailers including mass merchandise grocery drug convenience variety and other specialty stores these other retail companies operate stores in many of the areas where we operate and many of them engage in extensive advertising and marketing efforts our direct competitors in the dollar store retail category include family dollar dollar tree fred’s 99 cents only and various local independent operators competitors from other retail categories include walmart and walgreens among others certain of our competitors have greater financial distribution marketing and other resources than we do

the dollar store category differentiates itself from other forms of retailing by offering consistently low prices in a convenient smallstore format we believe that our prices are competitive due in part to our low cost operating structure and the relatively limited assortment of products offered historically we have minimized labor by offering fewer price points and a reliance on simple merchandise presentation we attempt to locate primarily in secondtier locations either in small towns or in the neighborhoods of more densely populated areas where occupancy expenses are relatively low we maintain a strong purchasing power position due to our leadership position in the dollar store retail category which centers on a focused assortment of merchandise

general economic factors may adversely affect our financial performance general economic conditions in one or more of the markets we serve may adversely affect our financial performance a general slowdown in the economy higher interest rates higher fuel and other energy costs inflation higher levels of unemployment higher consumer debt levels higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws and other economic factors could adversely affect consumer demand for the products we sell change our sales mix of products to one with a lower average gross profit and result in slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns on inventory higher interest rates higher commodities rates higher fuel and other energy costs transportation costs inflation higher costs of labor insurance and healthcare foreign exchange rate fluctuations higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws changes in other laws and regulations and other economic factors increase our cost of sales and operating selling general and administrative expenses and otherwise adversely affect the operations and operating results of our stores 

our plans depend significantly on initiatives designed to improve the efficiencies costs and effectiveness of our operations and failure to achieve or sustain these plans could affect our performance adversely we have had and expect to continue to have initiatives such as those relating to marketing advertising merchandising promotions and real estate in various stages of testing evaluation and implementation upon which we expect to rely to improve our results of operations and financial condition these initiatives are inherently risky and uncertain even when tested successfully in their application to our business in general it is possible that successful testing can result partially from resources and attention that cannot be duplicated in broader implementation testing and general implementation also can be affected by other risk factors described herein that reduce the results expected successful systemwide implementation relies on consistency of training stability of workforce ease of execution and the absence of offsetting factors that can influence results adversely failure to achieve successful implementation of our initiatives or the cost of these initiatives exceeding management’s estimates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition please reference the discussion of the initiatives in the “executive overview” portion of management’s discussion and analysis below

because our business is moderately seasonal with the highest portion of sales occurring during the fourth quarter adverse events during the fourth quarter could materially affect our financial statements as a whole  we generally recognize a significant portion of our net sales and net income during the christmas selling season which occurs in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year in anticipation of this holiday we purchase substantial amounts of seasonal 

inventory and hire many temporary employees a seasonal merchandise inventory imbalance could result if for any reason our net sales during the christmas selling season were to fall below either seasonal norms or expectations if for any reason our fourth quarter results were substantially below expectations our profitability and operating results could be adversely affected by unanticipated markdowns especially in seasonal merchandise lower than anticipated sales in the christmas selling season would also negatively affect our ability to absorb the increased seasonal labor costs

we face intense competition that could limit our growth opportunities and reduce our profitability  the retail business is highly competitive we operate in the discount retail merchandise business which is highly competitive with respect to price store location merchandise quality assortment and presentation instock consistency and customer service this competitive environment subjects us to the risk of reduced profitability because of the lower prices and thus the lower margins required to maintain our competitive position also companies operating in the discount retail merchandise sector due to customer demographics and other factors have limited ability to increase prices in response to increased costs including vendor price increases this limitation may adversely affect our margins and profitability we compete for customers employees store sites products and services and in other important aspects of our business with many other local regional and national retailers we compete with retailers operating discount mass merchandise drug convenience variety and specialty stores supermarkets and supercentertype stores certain of our competitors have greater financial distribution marketing and other resources than we do these other competitors compete in a variety of ways including aggressive promotional activities merchandise selection and availability services offered to customers location store hours instore amenities and price if we fail to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets it could adversely affect our financial performance see “business” in item 1 above for additional discussion of our competitive situation 

although the retail industry as a whole is highly fragmented certain segments of the retail industry have recently undergone and continue to undergo some consolidation which can significantly alter the competitive dynamics of the retail marketplace this consolidation may result in competitors with greatly improved financial resources improved access to merchandise greater market penetration and other improvements in their competitive positions these business combinations could result in the provision of a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices by these consolidated companies which could adversely affect our financial performance competition for customers has intensified in recent years as larger competitors have moved into or increased their presence in our geographic markets we remain vulnerable to the marketing power and high level of consumer recognition of these larger competitors and to the risk that these competitors or others could venture into the “dollar store” industry in a significant way generally we expect an increase in competition

natural disasters unusually adverse weather conditions pandemic outbreaks boycotts and geopolitical events could adversely affect our financial performance the occurrence of one or more natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes unusually adverse weather conditions pandemic outbreaks boycotts and geopolitical events such as civil unrest in countries in which our suppliers are located and acts of terrorism or similar disruptions could adversely affect our operations and financial performance these events could result in physical 

damage to one or more of our properties increases in fuel or other energy prices the temporary or permanent closure of one or more of our stores or dcs delays in opening new stores the temporary lack of an adequate work force in a market the temporary or longterm disruption in the supply of products from some local and overseas suppliers the temporary disruption in the transport of goods from overseas delay in the delivery of goods to our dcs or stores the temporary reduction in the availability of products in our stores and disruption to our information systems these events also can have indirect consequences such as increases in the costs of insurance following a destructive hurricane season these factors could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations and financial performance 

risks associated with the domestic and foreign suppliers from whom our products are sourced could adversely affect our financial performance the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers political and economic instability in the countries in which foreign suppliers are located the financial instability of suppliers suppliers’ failure to meet our supplier standards labor problems experienced by our suppliers the availability of raw materials to suppliers merchandise quality issues currency exchange rates transport availability and cost inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control in addition the united states’ foreign trade policies tariffs and other impositions on imported goods trade sanctions imposed on certain countries the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control disruptions due to labor stoppages strikes or slowdowns or other disruptions involving our vendors or the transportation and handling industries also may negatively affect our ability to receive merchandise and thus may negatively affect sales these and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our financial performance in addition our ability to obtain indemnification from foreign suppliers may be hindered by the manufacturers’ lack of understanding of us product liability or other laws which may make it more likely that we may be required to respond to claims or complaints from customers as if we were the manufacturer of the products as we increase our imports of merchandise from foreign vendors the risks associated with foreign imports will increase

we are dependent on attracting and retaining qualified employees while also controlling labor costs our future performance depends on our ability to attract retain and motivate qualified employees many of these employees are in entrylevel or parttime positions with historically high rates of turnover availability of personnel varies widely from location to location our ability to meet our labor needs generally including our ability to find qualified personnel to fill positions that become vacant at our existing stores and dcs while controlling our labor costs is subject to numerous external factors including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force of the markets in which we are located unemployment levels within those markets prevailing wage rates and changes in minimum wage laws changing demographics health and other insurance costs and changes in employment legislation increased turnover also can have significant indirect costs including more recruiting and training needs store disruptions due to management changeover and potential delays in new store openings or adverse customer reactions to inadequate customer service levels due to personnel shortages competition for qualified employees exerts upward pressure on wages paid to attract such personnel

also our stores are decentralized and are managed through a network of geographically dispersed management personnel our inability to effectively and efficiently operate our stores including the ability to control losses resulting from inventory and cash shrinkage may negatively affect our sales andor operating margins

our planned future growth will be impeded which would adversely affect sales if we cannot open new stores on schedule or if we close a number of stores materially in excess of anticipated levels our growth is dependent on both increases in sales in existing stores and the ability to open new stores our ability to timely open new stores and to expand into additional market areas depends in part on the following factors the availability of attractive store locations the absence of occupancy delays the ability to negotiate favorable lease terms the ability to hire and train new personnel especially store managers the ability to identify customer demand in different geographic areas general economic conditions and the availability of sufficient funds for expansion in addition many of these factors affect our ability to successfully relocate stores many of these factors are beyond our control delays or failures in opening new stores or achieving lower than expected sales in new stores or drawing a greater than expected proportion of sales in new stores from existing stores could materially adversely affect our growth in addition we may not anticipate all of the challenges imposed by the expansion of our operations and as a result may not meet our targets for opening new stores or expanding profitably 

some of our new stores may be located in areas where we have little or no meaningful experience those markets may have different competitive conditions market conditions consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns than our existing markets which may cause our new stores to be less successful than stores in our existing markets 

some of our new stores will be located in areas where we have existing units although we have experience in these markets increasing the number of locations in these markets may cause us to oversaturate markets and temporarily or permanently divert customers and sales from our existing stores thereby adversely affecting our overall profitability

we are dependent upon the smooth functioning of our distribution network the capacity of our dcs and the timely receipt of inventory  we rely upon the ability to replenish depleted inventory through deliveries to our dcs from vendors and from the dcs to our stores by various means of transportation including shipments by sea and truck labor shortages in the transportation industry could negatively affect transportation costs in addition longterm disruptions to the national and international transportation infrastructure that lead to delays or interruptions of service would adversely affect our business 

the efficient operation of our business is heavily dependent upon our information systems  we depend on a variety of information technology systems for the efficient functioning of our business we rely on certain software vendors to maintain and periodically upgrade many of these systems so that they can continue to support our business the software programs supporting many of our systems were licensed to us by independent software developers the inability of these developers or us to continue to maintain and upgrade these information systems and software programs would disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations if we were unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner in addition costs and 

potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology or with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems could also disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations we also rely heavily on our information technology staff if we cannot meet our staffing needs in this area we may not be able to fulfill our technology initiatives while continuing to provide maintenance on existing systems

we are subject to governmental regulations procedures and requirements a significant change in or noncompliance with these regulations could have a material adverse effect on profitability our business is subject to numerous federal state and local regulations changes in these regulations particularly those governing the sale of products may require extensive system and operating changes that may be difficult to implement and could increase our cost of doing business untimely compliance or noncompliance with applicable regulations or untimely or incomplete execution of a required product recall can result in the imposition of penalties including loss of licenses or significant fines or monetary penalties 

our current insurance program may expose us to unexpected costs and negatively affect our profitably historically our insurance coverage has reflected deductibles selfinsured retentions limits of liability and similar provisions that we believe are prudent based on the dispersion of our operations however there are types of losses we may incur but against which we cannot be insured or which we believe are not economically reasonable to insure such as losses due to acts of war employee and certain other crime and some natural disasters if we incur these losses our business could suffer certain material events may result in sizable losses for the insurance industry and adversely impact the availability of adequate insurance coverage or result in excessive premium increases to offset negative insurance market trends we may elect to selfinsure accept higher deductibles or reduce the amount of coverage in response to these market changes in addition we selfinsure a significant portion of expected losses under our workers’ compensation automobile liability general liability and group health insurance programs unanticipated changes in any applicable actuarial assumptions and management estimates underlying our recorded liabilities for these losses including expected increases in medical and indemnity costs could result in materially different amounts of expense than expected under these programs which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations although we continue to maintain property insurance for catastrophic events we are effectively selfinsured for losses up to the amount of our deductibles if we experience a greater number of these losses than we anticipate our profitability could be adversely affected

litigation may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations our business is subject to the risk of litigation by employees consumers suppliers shareholders government agencies or others through private actions class actions administrative proceedings regulatory actions or other litigation the outcome of litigation particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions is difficult to assess or quantify plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to these lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time in addition certain of these lawsuits if decided adversely to us or settled by us may result in liability material to our financial statements as a whole or may negatively affect our operating results if changes to our business operation are required the cost to defend future litigation may be significant there also may be adverse publicity associated 

with litigation that could negatively affect customer perception of our business regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable as a result litigation may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations please see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding certain of these pending matters

in addition from time to time third parties may claim that our trademarks or product offerings infringe upon their proprietary rights any such claim whether or not it has merit could be timeconsuming and distracting for executive management result in costly litigation cause changes to our private label offerings or delays in introducing new private label offerings or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements as a result any such claim could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition

our credit facility and other debt instruments place financial and other restrictions on us our debt obligations and financings have certain financial covenants and limits on our ability to incur additional indebtedness to sell assets and to make certain payments the lender’s ongoing obligation to extend credit under these financings will depend upon our compliance with these and other covenants in addition we may need to incur additional indebtedness which may have important consequences including placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that may have proportionately less debt limiting our flexibility in planning for changes in our business and the industry and making us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business

our profitability could decline if we substantially exceed our anticipated borrowings under our amended credit facility the amount of borrowings under our amended credit facility may fluctuate materially particularly given the seasonality of our business depending on various factors including the time of year our need to acquire merchandise inventory changes to our merchandising plans and initiatives changes to our capital expenditure plans and the occurrence of other events or transactions that may require funding through the amended credit facility if these borrowings under our amended credit facility exceed our anticipated levels our interest expense would increase beyond our expectations and a decrease in our profitability could result

our annual and quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly and could fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors due to a number of factors some of which are beyond our control resulting in a decline in the price of our securities our annual and quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly because of several factors including those described above accordingly results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year and revenues and net income for any particular future period may decrease in the future operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors in that event the price of our securities could decrease

failure to complete the proposed merger could adversely affect us on march 11 2007 we entered into a merger agreement with affiliates of kohlberg kravis roberts  co lp “kkr” there is no assurance that the merger agreement and the merger will be approved by our shareholders or that the other conditions to the completion of the merger will be satisfied the current market price of our common stock may reflect a market assumption that the merger

provisions in our charter tennessee law and our shareholder rights plan may discourage potential acquirors of our company which could adversely affect the value of our securities our charter contains provisions that may have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire or attempt to acquire control of our company in addition we are subject to certain provisions of tennessee law that limit in some cases our ability to engage in certain business combinations with significant shareholders also our shareholder rights plan may inhibit accumulations of substantial amounts of our common stock without the approval of our board of directors

these provisions either alone or in combination with each other give our current directors and executive officers a substantial ability to influence the outcome of a proposed 

acquisition of our company these provisions would apply even if an acquisition or other significant corporate transaction was considered beneficial by some of our shareholders if a changeincontrol or change in management is delayed or prevented by these provisions the market price of our securities could decline

executive overview 

dollar general corporation is the largest dollar store value discount retailer of consumable basics in the united states with over 8000 stores we are committed to serving the needs of low middle and fixedincome customers however we sell quality private label and national brand products that appeal to a wide range of customers our small box retail model provides a compelling combination of value and convenience we believe many of our customers shop at our stores because they trust us to consistently stock quality merchandise at low prices and they are able to complete a shopping trip in a limited amount of time many of our stores are located in towns that many retailers may find too small to support their business model which has allowed us to continue to increase our store count faster than most retailers 

we operate in the highly competitive retail industry and face strong sales competition from other retailers that sell general merchandise and food we strive to keep operating costs as low as possible in order to support our every day low price strategy while seeking a strong return on our investment this effort affects all expenses but is particularly critical as we compete for retail site locations and for qualified talent to manage and operate our stores

our management team continues to focus on making good investment decisions for our longterm growth and profitability in an effort to better support sales efforts in our stores and to improve profitability we have attempted to strengthen our senior leadership team over the last several years and to improve synergies between store operations store development merchandising marketing and the supply chain we believe we now have a strong leadership team in place and are beginning to see the impact of its efforts throughout the organization in particular this team developed and has begun to implement significant new programs related to our merchandising and real estate strategies

early in the fiscal year we made changes to address unexpected shortfalls in samestore sales performance and declining customer traffic that we experienced from september 2005 through march 2006 our efforts to arrest the trend and generate higher sales included significant increases in our promotional efforts utilizing advertising circulars and more promotional pricing beginning in the first quarter of 2006 we also added more national brands which typically carry a lower gross profit rate in several merchandise categories including food snacks and automotive while these efforts did reverse the samestore sales trend and resulted in improved sales the gross profit rate and selling general and administrative expenses rate to sales were unfavorably impacted accordingly we began to concentrate our efforts on increasing the sales in our higher gross profit categories namely home products basic clothing and seasonal the evaluation of our performance in these categories led us to challenge our longtime business practice of packing away endofseason merchandise 

in november 2006 we announced a plan to minimize the amount of merchandise in the stores that is carried over to subsequent periods “packaway” we began a significant effort in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 to sellthrough this inventory eliminating over half of the targeted merchandise by the end of the fiscal year with few exceptions we plan to eliminate through endofseason and other markdowns existing seasonal home and apparel packaway inventories from the stores by the end of fiscal 2007 allowing for newer and fresher items and more appealing merchandise presentation as we move forward to maximize the financial returns of this initiative while accelerating the sellthrough of the targeted inventory we developed a schedule for markdowns and established an oversight team to monitor our efforts in addition we are utilizing television and radio advertising to help increase awareness of this effort as well as to introduce potential customers to our brand and everyday product offerings

discontinuing our traditional inventory packaway management model is an attempt to better meet our customers’ needs and to ensure an appealing fresh merchandise selection in addition beginning in fiscal 2007 we plan to sell virtually all currentyear nonreplenishable merchandise by taking endofseason markdowns allowing for increased levels of newer currentseason merchandise we believe this strategy change will enhance the appearance of our stores and will positively impact customer satisfaction as well as the store employees’ ability to manage stores ultimately resulting in higher sales increased gross profit lower employee turnover and decreased inventory shrink and damages we also expect that this improved inventory management will result in more appropriate per store inventory levels

also in november 2006 we announced significant changes to our real estate strategy after a comprehensive analysis of the performance of each of our stores management 

recommended and the board of directors approved a plan to focus on upgrading our existing store base in order to enhance the store experience for customers as part of this plan we announced our intention to close by the end of fiscal 2007 approximately 400 stores that do not meet our real estate criteria to remodel or relocate approximately 300 stores in fiscal 2007 and to decelerate new store openings with an expectation of opening 300 new stores in fiscal 2007 in fiscal 2006 we opened 537 new stores and closed 237 stores including 128 store closings identified in this strategic review we will continue to apply rigorous criteria to new and existing stores and will look for other enhancements to optimize our real estate strategy for profitable growth

in connection with the accelerated implementation of our new inventory merchandising strategies to virtually eliminate packaway inventories and to sell through merchandise in the closing stores we incurred substantially higher markdowns on inventory while we believe these initiatives had a positive impact on sales they had a negative impact on our gross profit rate in 2006 in total our gross profit rate declined by 289 basis points to 258 in 2006 compared to 287 in 2005 significantly impacting our gross profit rate as a result of the related effect on cost of goods sold were total markdowns of 2791 million at cost taken during 2006 compared with total markdowns of 1065 million at cost taken in 2005 the 2006 markdowns reflect 1799 million at cost taken during the fourth quarter of 2006 compared to 390 million of markdowns at cost taken during the fourth quarter of 2005 markdowns which were expected to reduce inventory below cost were considered in our lower of cost or market estimate and recorded at such time as the utility of the underlying inventory was deemed to be impaired during the third quarter of fiscal 2006 we recorded a lower of cost or market inventory impairment estimate related to the initiatives discussed above and this estimate was revised slightly in the fourth quarter such that the impact for fiscal 2006 was 702 million which reduced 2006 gross profit by a corresponding amount markdowns which are not below cost impact our gross profit in the period in which such markdowns are taken a portion of the total markdowns taken during the fourth quarter were related to the inventory included in our lower of cost or market estimate thereby reducing our estimate of such inventory as of the end of fiscal 2006 to 492 million this inventory is expected to be sold during 2007 

in addition we currently estimate that we will recognize total pretax sga charges associated with these inventory and real estate initiatives of approximately 1046 million of this total approximately 334 million is reflected in our results of operations during 2006 as follows in millions 

 

the remaining costs outlined in the table above are currently expected to be incurred in 2007 however the amount and timing of these costs and charges as well as the amount of belowcost inventory estimates and adjustments may vary materially depending on various factors including timing in the execution of the plan the outcome of negotiations with landlords andor potential sublease tenants the accuracy of assumptions used by management in developing these estimates final inventory levels the timing and adequacy of markdowns and retail market conditions

we expect markdowns from retail to continue at significantly higher than historical levels throughout 2007 which will impact our expected gross profit specifically we expect the gross profit rate to sales to be in the low 27 percent range in fiscal 2007 we are targeting a gross profit rate to sales of approximately 28 percent for fiscal 2008 and 29 percent for fiscal 2009 we expect to increase our sales mix of merchandise categories with higher gross profit rates such as home apparel and seasonal merchandise as we become increasingly able to improve our merchandise assortments and stock our stores with more current inventory achievement of our gross profit targets is contingent upon this expected sales mix improvement as well as effective inventory management and reductions in inventory shrink and damages

in addition to these strategic efforts we have made progress in the following operating initiatives outlined in our annual report on form 10k for the 2005 fiscal year 

· 

we completed our implementation of the ezstore process in all of our stores and continue to be encouraged by our store managers’ response to the program and the opportunities to reduce costs in labor workers’ compensation and damages among others 

· 

we completed construction of our ninth distribution center “dc” in marion indiana which commenced operations in august of 2006 

· 

our new store layout has been implemented in 359 of our most recent new relocated or remodeled stores operating results of the new layout in these stores continue to be encouraging and we plan to implement this new format in the majority of new stores to be opened or relocated in fiscal 2007 

· 

we generated sufficient cash flow to allow us to repurchase approximately 45 million shares of our common stock for 799 million and to pay dividends of 625 million an increase per share of 14 percent 

for the year ended february 2 2007 we reported net income of 1379 million or 044 per diluted share compared to net income of 3502 million or 108 per diluted share for the year ended february 3 2006 

total revenues for the year increased by 68 over the prior year aided by new stores and a samestore sales increase of 33 based on the comparable 52week period the extra week in fiscal 2005 accounted for sales of approximately 1629 million our gross profit rate was 258 in 2006 compared to 287 in 2005 primarily due to our 2006 strategic initiatives as further discussed below under “results of operations” operating expenses as a rate to sales were 231 in fiscal 2006 compared to 222 in fiscal 2005 resulting from charges directly related to the strategic store closings and a 299 million increase in advertising expenses a 

portion of which can be attributed to the inventory liquidation and store closing initiatives additionally administrative salaries incentive bonuses and related payroll taxes excluding benefits increased by 250 million resulting from the approval of a 96 million discretionary bonus to approximately 7000 administrative and dc employees and the addition of executives and staff to support our strategic efforts particularly in merchandising and real estate partially offsetting these amounts were insurance proceeds of 130 million received during 2006 related to losses we experienced due to hurricane katrina

readers should refer to the detailed discussion of operating results below for additional comments on financial performance in the 2006 fiscal year as compared with the prior year while we are disappointed with our 2006 financial results we are excited about and confident in our strategic decisions to accelerate our real estate strategies and the elimination of our packaway inventory model we believe these actions will allow us to sharpen our focus on serving the demands of our customers and will ultimately result in improved financial performance

while we provide no assurance that we will be successful or continue to be successful as applicable in executing any or all of these initiatives and do not guarantee that their successful implementation would result in improved financial performance management continues to believe that they are appropriate initiatives to consider for the longterm success of the business

company performance measures management uses a number of metrics including those indicated on the table included in “results of operations” below to assess its performance the following are the more frequently discussed metrics

 

· 

earnings per share “eps” growth is an indicator of the increased returns generated for our shareholders eps of 044 in 2006 reflected a decrease of 59 from eps of 108 in 2005 significant elements of this decrease were discussed above 

· 

total net sales growth indicates among other things the success of our selection of new store locations and merchandising strategies total net sales increased 68 in 2006 note that fiscal 2005 included a 53 rd week

· 

samestore sales growth indicates whether our merchandising strategies store execution and customer service in existing stores have been successful in generating increased sales samestore sales increased 33 in 2006 with stronger samestore sales in the latter half of the year than the first half as a result of our promotional and strategic initiatives 

· 

operating margin rate operating profit divided by net sales which is an indicator of our success in leveraging our fixed costs and managing our variable costs declined to 27 in 2006 versus 65 in 2005 the various components impacting this metric are fully discussed in “results of operations” below 

· 

inventory turns cost of goods sold for the year divided by average inventory balances at cost measured at the end of the latest five fiscal quarters is an indicator of how well we are managing the largest asset on our balance sheet inventory turns were 43 times in 2006 compared to 42 times in 2005 including the 53 rd week

· 

return on average assets net income for the year divided by average total assets measured at the end of the latest five fiscal quarters is an overall indicator of our 

effectiveness in deploying our resources return on assets was 44 in 2006 and 121 in 2005

key items for fiscal 2007 for 2007 we have established the following priorities and initiatives aimed at continuing our growth and improving our operating and financial performance while remaining focused on serving our customers

· 

sell through or otherwise eliminate 100 of the targeted inventory to virtually eliminate the packaway strategy allowing us to have fresher merchandise and cleaner neater stores enhancing the shopping experience for our customers and the work experience of our employees 

· 

close the remaining underperforming stores identified as part of our revitalization efforts 

· 

open 300 new stores and relocate or remodel 300 existing stores using our new real estate criteria 

· 

further develop merchandising capabilities and tools 

· 

increase the discipline in our merchandise planning buying and allocation processes 

in addition we intend to continue our efforts to significantly reduce inventory shrink and to develop a strategic roadmap to reduce store manager turnover

we can provide no assurance that we will be successful in executing these initiatives nor can we guarantee that the successful implementation of these initiatives will result in superior financial performance 

results of operations 

the following discussion of our financial performance is based on the consolidated financial statements set forth herein the following table contains results of operations data for the 2006 2005 and 2004 fiscal years and the dollar and percentage variances among those years 

 

a

includes the impacts of certain strategic initiatives as more fully described in the “executive overview” above

b

the fiscal year ended february 3 2006 was comprised of 53 weeks

net sales  increases in 2006 net sales resulted primarily from opening additional stores including 300 net new stores in 2006 and a samestore sales increase of 33 for 2006 compared to 2005 samestore sales increases are calculated based on the comparable calendar weeks in the prior year accordingly the same store sales percentages discussed herein exclude sales from the 53 rd week of 2005 as there was no comparable week in 2006 or 2004 the increase in samestore sales accounted for 2654 million of the increase in sales while stores opened since the beginning of 2006 were the primary contributors to the remaining 3222 million sales increase during 2006 the increase in samestore sales is primarily attributable to an increase in average customer purchase we also believe that the strategic merchandising and real estate initiatives discussed above in the “executive overview” had a positive impact on net sales

we monitor our sales internally by the following four major categories highly consumable seasonal home products and basic clothing the highly consumable category has a lower gross profit rate than the other three categories and has grown significantly over the past several years this shift is in part the result of our strategic efforts to broaden our consumable product offerings and add more recognizable national brands in order to attract customers however we believe the increase in consumables as a percent of total sales has also been affected by changes in customers’ needs and by economic pressures such as higher gasoline and energy prices which have resulted in reductions in the percentages of total sales of our home products and basic clothing categories as noted above in the “executive overview” we expect the move away from our packaway inventory strategy will have a positive impact on sales in our nonconsumable merchandise categories because of the impact of sales mix on gross profit we continually review our merchandise mix and strive to adjust it when appropriate maintaining an appropriate sales mix among the four categories is an integral part of achieving our gross profit and sales goals

by merchandise category our sales increase in 2006 compared to 2005 was primarily attributable to the highly consumable category which increased by 4155 million or 74 an increase in sales of seasonal merchandise of 1612 million or 120 also contributed to overall sales growth we believe that our increased sales by merchandise category were supported by recent additions to our product offerings and increased promotional activities including the use of advertising circulars and clearance activities

increases in 2005 net sales resulted primarily from opening additional stores including 609 net new stores in 2005 and a samestore sales increase of 20 for 2005 compared to 2004 the increase in samestore sales accounted for 1442 million of the increase in sales stores opened since the beginning of 2004 as well as the 1629 million impact of the 53 rd week of sales in fiscal year 2005 for all stores were the primary contributors to the remaining 7771 million sales increase during 2005 the increase in samestore sales is primarily attributable to an increase in average customer purchase 

samestore sales calculations for 2005 and prior include only those stores that were open both at the end of that period and at the beginning of the preceding fiscal year beginning in fiscal 2006 we revised and published our method for determining the stores that are included in our publicly released samestore sales calculations the revised samestore sales calculations include those stores that have been open at least 13 full fiscal months and remain open at the end 

of the reporting period using the revised methodology the samestore sales increase in 2005 was 22

gross profit  the gross profit rate decline in 2006 as compared with 2005 was due primarily to a significant increase in markdown activity as a percentage of sales including belowcost markdowns as a result of our inventory liquidation and store closing initiatives while we believe these initiatives had a positive impact on sales they had a negative impact on our gross profit rate in 2006 in total our gross profit rate declined by 289 basis points to 258 in 2006 compared to 287 in 2005 significantly impacting our gross profit rate as a result of the related effect on cost of goods sold were total markdowns of 2791 million at cost taken during 2006 compared with total markdowns of 1065 million at cost taken in 2005 the 2006 markdowns reflect 1799 million at cost taken during the fourth quarter of 2006 compared to 390 million markdowns at cost taken during the fourth quarter of 2005 the fourth quarter 2006 change in merchandising strategy also resulted in our ending inventory being valued lower than under our historical practices as ending inventory onhand as of february 2 2007 reflects the immediate impact of the markdowns at the time such markdowns were taken rather than at the time such inventory is sold the impact of this reduction to inventory value approximated 307 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 markdowns which were expected to reduce inventory below cost were considered in our lower of cost or market estimate and recorded at such time as the utility of the underlying inventory was deemed to be impaired during the third quarter of fiscal 2006 we recorded a lower of cost or market inventory impairment estimate related to the initiatives discussed above and this estimate was revised slightly in the fourth quarter such that the impact for fiscal 2006 was 702 million which reduced 2006 gross profit by a corresponding amount markdowns which are not below cost impact our gross profit in the period in which such markdowns are taken a portion of the total markdowns taken during the fourth quarter were related to the inventory included in our lower of cost or market estimate thereby reducing our estimate of such inventory as of the end of fiscal 2006 to 492 million this inventory is expected to be sold during 2007 other factors included but were not limited to a decrease in the markups on purchases primarily attributable to purchases of highly consumable products including nationally branded products which generally have lower average markups and an increase in our shrink rate

the gross profit rate declined by 82 basis points in 2005 as compared with 2004 due to a number of factors including but not limited to lower sales as a percentage of total sales in our seasonal home products and basic clothing categories which have higher than average markups an increase in markdowns as a percentage of sales primarily as a result of our initiative to reduce perstore inventory higher transportation expenses primarily attributable to increased fuel costs an increase in our shrink rate and an estimated 52 million reduction resulting from the expansion of the number of departments utilized for the gross profit calculation from 10 to 23 as further described below under “critical accounting policies and estimates” these factors were partially offset by higher average markups on our beginning inventory in 2005 as compared with 2004

in 2006 2005 and 2004 we experienced inventory shrinkage stated as a percentage of sales of 340 322 and 305 respectively

selling general and administrative “sga” expense  the increase in sga expense as a percentage of sales in 2006 as compared with 2005 was due to a number of factors including but not limited to increases in the following expense categories impairment charges on leasehold improvements and store fixtures totaling 94 million including 80 million related to the planned closings of approximately 400 underperforming stores 128 of which closed in 2006 and the remainder of which are scheduled to close in 2007 as further discussed above in the “executive overview” lease contract terminations totaling 57 million related to these stores higher store occupancy costs increased 121 due to higher average monthly rentals associated with our leased store locations higher debit and credit card fees increased 406 due to the increased customer usage of debit cards and the acceptance of visa credit and check cards at all locations higher administrative labor costs increased 299 primarily related to recent additions to our executive team particularly in merchandising and real estate and the expensing of stock options higher advertising costs increased 1983 related primarily to the distribution of several advertising circulars in the current year period and to promotional activities related to the inventory clearance and store closing activities discussed above and higher incentive compensation primarily related to the 96 million discretionary bonus authorized by the board of directors for the current fiscal year these increases were partially offset by insurance proceeds of 130 million received during the current year period related to losses incurred due to hurricane katrina and depreciation and amortization expenses that remained relatively constant in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005

the decrease in sga expense as a percentage of sales in 2005 as compared with 2004 was due to a number of factors including but not limited to the following expense categories that either declined or increased less than the 120 increase in sales employee incentive compensation expense decreased 378 based upon our fiscal 2005 financial performance professional fees decreased 323 primarily due to the reduction of consulting fees associated with the ezstore project and 2004 fees associated with our initial sarbanesoxley compliance effort and employee health benefits decreased 100 due in part to a downward revision in claim lag assumptions based upon review and recommendation by our outside actuary and decreased claims costs as a percentage of sales partially offsetting these reductions in sga were current year increases in store occupancy costs increased 176 primarily due to rising average monthly rentals associated with our leased store locations and store utilities costs increased 227 primarily related to increased electricity and gas expense

interest income the decline in interest income in 2006 compared to 2005 is due primarily to the acquisition of the entity which held legal title to the south boston dc in june 2006 and the related elimination of the notes receivable which represented debt issued by this entity from which we formerly leased the south boston dc the increase in interest income in 2005 compared to 2004 is due primarily to earnings on shortterm investments due to increased interest rates on these investments 

interest expense  the increase in interest expense in 2006 is primarily attributable to increased interest expense of 65 million under our revolving credit agreement primarily due to increased borrowings an increase in taxrelated interest of 41 million principally due to the nonrecurrence in 2006 of a 2005 reduction in accrued interest related to contingent tax liabilities offset by a reduction in interest expense associated with the elimination of the financing obligation associated with the june 2006 acquisition of the entity which held legal title 

to the south boston dc as discussed above the decrease in interest expense in 2005 is primarily attributable to a reduction in taxrelated interest expense of 14 million principally due to the reversal of interest accruals pertaining to certain income tax related contingencies that were resolved during 2005 we had variablerate debt of 145 million as of february 2 2007 and february 3 2006 the remainder of our outstanding indebtedness at february 2 2007 and february 3 2006 was fixed rate debt

income taxes  the effective income tax rates for 2006 2005 and 2004 were 374 357 and 356 respectively 

the 2006 income tax rate was higher than the 2005 rate by 17 factors contributing to this increase include additional expense of approximately 09 million related to the adoption of a new tax system in the state of texas which resulted in the elimination of certain deferred tax assets that had been recorded in prior years an increase of approximately 09 million in expense related to the company’s current year tax liability under the revised state of texas tax system a reduction in the contingent income tax reserve due to the resolution of contingent liabilities that is 20 million less than the decrease that occurred in 2005 an increase in the deferred tax valuation allowance of approximately 32 million related to state income tax credits and an increase of 26 million related to a benefit recognized in 2005 resulting from an internal restructuring offsetting these rate increases was a reduction in the income tax rate related to federal income tax credits due to the reduction in the company’s 2006 income before tax a small increase in the amount of federal income tax credits earned yielded a much larger percentage reduction in the income tax rate for 2006 versus 2005

while the 2005 and 2004 rates were similar overall the rates contained offsetting differences factors causing the 2005 tax rate to increase when compared to the 2004 tax rate include a reduction in federal jobs credits of approximately 10 million additional net foreign income tax expense of approximately 08 million and a decrease in the contingent income tax reserve due to resolution of contingent liabilities that was 36 million less than the decrease that occurred in 2004 factors causing the 2005 tax rate to decrease when compared to the 2004 tax rate include the recognition of state tax credits of approximately 23 million related to the construction of our dc in indiana and a benefit of approximately 26 million related to an internal restructuring that was completed during 2005 the overall effect of these items increased the 2005 effective tax rate by approximately 08

effects of inflation 

we believe that inflation andor deflation had a minimal impact on our overall operations during 2006 2005 and 2004

liquidity and capital resources 

current financial condition  recent developments  during the past three years we have generated an aggregate of approximately 135 billion in cash flows from operating activities during that period we expanded the number of stores we operate by approximately 23 over 1500 stores and incurred approximately 834 million in capital expenditures primarily to support this growth also during this threeyear period we expended approximately 

587 million for repurchases of our common stock and paid dividends of approximately 171 million

our inventory balance represented approximately 47 of our total assets as of february 2 2007 our proficiency in managing our inventory balances can have a significant impact on our cash flows from operations during a given fiscal year we have made more efficient inventory management a strategic priority as more fully discussed in the “executive overview” above

as described in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements we are involved in a number of legal actions and claims some of which could potentially result in material cash payments adverse developments in those actions could materially and adversely affect our liquidity we also have certain income taxrelated contingencies as more fully described below under “critical accounting policies and estimates” estimates of these contingent liabilities are included in our consolidated financial statements however future negative developments could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity see notes 5 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements

on november 29 2006 september 30 2005 and november 30 2004 the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 500 million 10 million shares and 10 million shares respectively of our outstanding common stock these authorizations allow or allowed as applicable purchases in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time subject to market conditions the objective of our share repurchase initiative is to enhance shareholder value by purchasing shares at a price that produces a return on investment that is greater than our cost of capital additionally share repurchases generally are undertaken only if such purchases result in an accretive impact on our fully diluted earnings per share calculation the 2006 authorization expires december 31 2008 the 2005 and 2004 authorizations were completed prior to their expiration dates during 2006 we purchased approximately 45 million shares pursuant to the 2005 authorization at a total cost of 799 million during 2005 we purchased approximately 150 million shares pursuant to the 2005 and 2004 authorizations at a total cost of 2976 million during 2004 we purchased approximately 110 million shares pursuant to the 2004 and a 2003 authorization at a total cost of 2093 million share repurchases affected diluted earnings per share by less than 001 in 2006

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of february 2 2007 in thousands

 

in 2006 and 2005 our south carolinabased wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary ashley river insurance company “aric” had cash and cash equivalents and investments balances held pursuant to south carolina regulatory requirements to maintain a specified percentage of aric’s liability and equity balances primarily insurance liabilities in the form of certain specified types of assets and as such these investments are not available for general corporate purposes at february 2 2007 these cash and cash equivalents balances and investments balances were 32 million and 497 million respectively 

in june 2006 we amended our existing revolving credit facility the amended credit facility has a maximum commitment of 400 million with the ability to increase to 500 million upon our mutual agreement with the lenders and expires in june 2011 in addition to revolving loans the amended credit facility includes a 15 million swingline loan sublimit and a 75 million letter of credit subfacility outstanding swingline loans and letters of credit reduce the borrowing capacity under the amended credit facility in december 2006 we further amended the revolving credit facility to lower the fixed charge coverage financial covenant for future 

periods through fiscal 2008 to take into account the impact that the initiatives discussed above in the “executive overview” related to merchandising and real estate strategies may have on the ratio in those periods at february 2 2007 we had no outstanding borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under the amended credit facility and were in compliance with all financial covenants contained in the amended credit facility

we have 200 million principal amount of 8 58 unsecured notes due june 15 2010 this indebtedness was incurred to assist in funding our growth interest on the notes is payable semiannually on june 15 and december 15 of each year we may seek from time to time to retire the notes through cash purchases on the open market in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise such repurchases if any will depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors the amounts involved may be material

in july 2005 as an inducement for us to select marion indiana as the site for construction of a new dc the economic development board of marion approved a tax increment financing in the amount of 145 million which matures february 1 2035 pursuant to this financing proceeds from the issuance of certain revenue bonds were loaned to us in connection with the construction of this dc the variable interest rate on this loan is based on the weekly remarketing of the bonds which are supported by a bank letter of credit and ranged from 460 to 543 in 2006 and from 352 to 460 in 2005

significant terms of our outstanding debt obligations could have an effect on our ability to incur additional debt financing the amended credit facility contains financial covenants which include limits on certain debt to cash flow ratios a fixed charge coverage test and minimum allowable consolidated net worth the amended credit facility also places certain specified limitations on secured and unsecured debt our outstanding notes discussed above place certain specified limitations on secured debt and place certain limitations on our ability to execute saleleaseback transactions 

we have generated significant cash flows from operations during recent years we had peak borrowings under the amended credit facility of 2534 million during 2006 1003 million during 2005 and 731 million during 2004 all of which were repaid prior to february 2 2007 february 3 2006 and january 28 2005 respectively therefore we do not believe that any existing limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness will have a material impact on liquidity notes 6 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements contain additional disclosures related to our debt and financing obligations

at february 2 2007 and february 3 2006 we had commercial letter of credit facilities totaling 2000 million and 1950 million respectively of which 1161 million and 851 million respectively were outstanding for the funding of imported merchandise purchases

during 2005 we incurred significant losses caused by hurricane katrina primarily inventory and fixed assets in the form of store fixtures and leasehold improvements we reached final settlement of our related insurance claim in 2006 and received proceeds totaling 210 million due to these losses including 130 million in 2006 and 80 million in 2005 and have utilized a portion of these proceeds to replace lost assets insurance proceeds related to fixed 

assets are included in cash flows from investing activities and proceeds related to inventory losses and business interruption are included in cash flows from operating activities

we believe that our existing cash balances 1893 million at february 2 2007 cash flows from operations 4054 million generated in 2006 the amended credit facility 400 million available at february 2 2007 and our anticipated ongoing access to the capital markets if necessary will provide sufficient financing to meet our currently foreseeable liquidity and capital resource needs

cash flows provided by operating activities  cash flows from operating activities for 2006 compared to 2005 declined by 1501 million the most significant component of the decline in cash flows from operating activities in 2006 as compared to 2005 was the reduction in net income as described in detail under “results of operations” above partially offsetting this decline are certain noncash charges included in net income including belowcost markdowns on inventory balances and property and equipment impairment charges totaling 781 million and a 138 million increase in noncash depreciation and amortization charges in 2006 as compared to 2005 in addition the reduction in 2006 year end inventory balances reflect the effect of belowcost markdowns and our efforts to sell through excess inventories as compared with increases in 2005 and 2004 seasonal inventory levels increased by 2 in 2006 as compared to a 10 increase in 2005 home products inventory levels declined by 25 in 2006 as compared to a 2 increase in 2005 while basic clothing inventory levels declined by 21 in 2006 as compared to a 5 decline in 2005 total merchandise inventories at the end of 2006 were 143 billion compared to 147 billion at the end of 2005 a 29 decrease overall and a 64 decrease on a per store basis reflecting both our focus on liquidating packaway merchandise and the effect of belowcost markdowns

cash flows from operating activities for 2005 compared to 2004 increased by 1640 million the most significant component of the increase in cash flows from operating activities in the 2005 period as compared to the 2004 period was the change in inventory balances seasonal inventory levels increased by 10 in 2005 as compared to a 22 increase in 2004 home products inventory levels increased by 2 in 2005 as compared to a 16 increase in 2004 while basic clothing inventory levels declined by 5 in 2005 as compared to a 21 increase in 2004 total merchandise inventories at the end of 2005 were 147 billion compared to 138 billion at the end of 2004 a 71 increase overall but a 1 decrease on a per store basis reflecting our 2005 focus on lowering our per store inventory levels

cash flows used in investing activities  cash flows used in investing activities totaling 2820 million in 2006 were primarily related to capital expenditures and to a lesser degree purchases of longterm investments significant components of our property and equipment purchases in 2006 included the following approximate amounts 66 million for distribution and transportationrelated capital expenditures including approximately 30 million related to our dc in marion indiana which opened in 2006 66 million for new stores 50 million for the ezstore project and 38 million for capital projects in existing stores during 2006 we opened 537 new stores and remodeled or relocated 64 stores

purchases and sales of shortterm investments in 2006 which equaled net sales of 19 million reflect our investment activities in taxexempt auction rate securities as well as investing 

activities of our captive insurance subsidiary purchases of longterm investments are related to the captive insurance subsidiary

significant components of our purchases of property and equipment in 2005 included the following approximate amounts 102 million for distribution and transportationrelated capital expenditures 96 million for new stores 47 million related to the ezstore project 18 million for certain fixtures in existing stores and 15 million for various systemsrelated capital projects during 2005 we opened 734 new stores and relocated or remodeled 82 stores distribution and transportation expenditures in 2005 included costs associated with the construction of our new dcs in south carolina and indiana

net sales of shortterm investments in 2005 of 341 million primarily reflect our investment activities in taxexempt auction rate securities purchases of longterm investments are related to our captive insurance subsidiary

cash flows used in investing activities of 2592 million in 2004 were also primarily related to capital expenditures significant components of our purchases of property and equipment in 2004 included the following approximate amounts 101 million for distribution and transportationrelated capital expenditures 82 million for new stores 26 million for certain fixtures in existing stores 26 million for various systemsrelated capital projects and 23 million for coolers in existing stores which allow the stores to carry refrigerated products during 2004 we opened 722 new stores and relocated or remodeled 80 stores distribution and transportation expenditures in 2004 included costs associated with the construction of our new dc in south carolina as well as costs associated with the expansion of the ardmore oklahoma and south boston virginia dcs

net sales of shortterm investments in 2004 of 258 million primarily reflect our investment activities in taxexempt auction rate securities

capital expenditures during 2007 are projected to be approximately 180 to 200 million we anticipate funding 2007 capital requirements with cash flows from operations and the amended credit facility if necessary significant components of the 2007 capital plan include leasehold improvements and fixtures and equipment for approximately 300 new stores continued investment in our existing store base plans for remodeling and relocating approximately 300 stores and additional investments in our supply chain we plan to undertake these expenditures in order to improve our infrastructure and provide support for our anticipated growth

cash flows used in financing activities  cash flows used in financing activities during 2006 included the repurchase of approximately 45 million shares of our common stock at a total cost of 799 million cash dividends paid of 625 million or 020 per share on our outstanding common stock and 141 million to reduce our outstanding capital lease and financing obligations these uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options during 2006 of 199 million

during 2005 we repurchased approximately 150 million shares of our common stock at a total cost of 2976 million paid cash dividends of 562 million or 0175 per share on our 

outstanding common stock and expended 143 million to reduce our outstanding capital lease and financing obligations also in 2005 we received proceeds of 145 million from the issuance of a tax increment financing in conjunction with the construction of our new dc in indiana and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of 294 million 

during 2004 we repurchased approximately 110 million shares of our common stock at a total cost of 2093 million paid cash dividends of 527 million or 016 per share on our outstanding common stock and expended 164 million to reduce our outstanding capital lease and financing obligations these uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options during 2004 of 341 million

the borrowings and repayments under the revolving credit agreement in 2006 2005 and 2004 were primarily a result of activity associated with periodic cash needs

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures in addition to the estimates presented below there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed critical as defined below we believe these estimates are reasonable and appropriate however if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used the resulting changes could have a material effect on the financial statements taken as a whole 

management believes the following policies and estimates are critical because they involve significant judgments assumptions and estimates management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosures presented below relating to those policies and estimates

merchandise inventories  merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined using the retail lastin firstout “lifo” method under our retail inventory method “rim” the calculation of gross profit and the resulting valuation of inventories at cost are computed by applying a calculated costtoretail inventory ratio to the retail value of sales the rim is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality also it is recognized that the use of the rim will result in valuing inventories at the lower of cost or market “lcm” if markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories

inherent in the rim calculation are certain significant management judgments and estimates including among others initial markups markdowns and shrinkage which significantly impact the gross profit calculation as well as the ending inventory valuation at cost these significant estimates coupled with the fact that the rim is an averaging process can under certain circumstances produce distorted cost figures factors that can lead to distortion in the calculation of the inventory balance include

· 

applying the rim to a group of products that is not fairly uniform in terms of its cost and selling price relationship and turnover 

· 

applying the rim to transactions over a period of time that include different rates of gross profit such as those relating to seasonal merchandise 

· 

inaccurate estimates of inventory shrinkage between the date of the last physical inventory at a store and the financial statement date and 

· 

inaccurate estimates of lcm andor lifo reserves 

to reduce the potential of such distortions in the valuation of inventory we expanded the number of departments we utilize for our gross profit calculation from 10 to 23 in 2005 other factors that reduce potential distortion include the use of historical experience in estimating the shrink provision see discussion below and the utilization of an independent statistician to assist in the lifo sampling process and index formulation as part of this process we also perform an inventoryaging analysis for determining obsolete inventory our policy is to write down inventory to an lcm value based on various management assumptions including estimated markdowns and sales required to liquidate such aged inventory in future periods inventory is reviewed on a quarterly basis and adjusted as appropriate to reflect writedowns determined to be necessary the estimated amount of the belowcost inventory writedowns for the strategic merchandising initiatives discussed above in the “executive overview” is based on management’s assumptions regarding the timing and adequacy of markdowns and the final adjustment may vary materially from the estimate depending on various factors including timing of the execution of the plan retail market conditions and the accuracy of assumptions used by management in developing these estimates

factors such as slower inventory turnover due to changes in competitors’ tactics consumer preferences consumer spending and unseasonable weather patterns among other factors could cause excess inventory requiring greater than estimated markdowns to entice consumer purchases resulting in an unfavorable impact on our consolidated financial statements sales shortfalls due to the above factors could cause reduced purchases from vendors and associated vendor allowances that would also result in an unfavorable impact on our consolidated financial statements 

 

we calculate our shrink provision based on actual physical inventory results during the fiscal period and an accrual for estimated shrink occurring subsequent to a physical inventory through the end of the fiscal reporting period this accrual is calculated as a percentage of sales at each retail store at a department level and is determined by dividing the booktophysical inventory adjustments recorded during the previous twelve months by the related sales for the same period for each store to the extent that subsequent physical inventories yield different results than this estimated accrual our effective shrink rate for a given reporting period will include the impact of adjusting the estimated results to the actual results although we perform physical inventories in virtually all of our stores on an annual basis the same stores do not necessarily get counted in the same reporting periods from year to year which could impact comparability in a given reporting period

property and equipment  property and equipment are recorded at cost we group our assets into relatively homogeneous classes and generally provide for depreciation on a straightline basis over the estimated average useful life of each asset class except for leasehold improvements which are amortized over the shorter of the applicable lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset the valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful depreciable lives involves significant judgments and the use of estimates

impairment of longlived assets we review the carrying value of all longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” we review for impairment stores open more than two years for which current cash flows from operations are negative impairment results when the carrying value of the assets exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows over the life of the lease our estimate of undiscounted future cash flows over the lease term is based upon historical operations of the stores and estimates of future store profitability which encompasses many factors that are subject to variability and difficult to predict if a longlived asset is found to be impaired the amount recognized for impairment is equal to the difference between the carrying value and the asset’s fair value the fair value is estimated based primarily upon future cash flows discounted at our credit adjusted riskfree rate or other reasonable estimates of fair market value

in connection with the strategic real estate initiatives noted above we performed a comprehensive review of all of our stores and recorded impairment charges in 2006 totaling approximately 94 million including 80 million related to the approximately 400 underperforming stores targeted for closing by the end of 2007

insurance liabilities  we retain a significant portion of the risk for our workers’ compensation employee health insurance general liability property loss and automobile coverage these costs are significant primarily due to the large employee base and number of stores provisions are made to this insurance liability on an undiscounted basis based on actual claim data and estimates of incurred but not reported claims developed by independent actuaries utilizing historical claim trends if future claim trends deviate from recent historical patterns we may be required to record additional expenses or expense reductions which could be material to our future financial results

contingent liabilities – income taxes  we are subject to routine income tax audits that occur periodically in the normal course of business we estimate our contingent income tax liabilities based on our assessment of probable income taxrelated exposures and the anticipated settlement of those exposures translating into actual future liabilities the contingent liabilities are estimated based on both historical audit experiences with various state and federal taxing authorities and our interpretation of current income taxrelated trends the adoption of financial accounting standards board “fasb” interpretation 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes – an interpretation of fasb statement 109 “fin 48” in fiscal 2007 is expected to have an impact on our estimates of contingent income tax liabilities which has not yet been quantified 

if our income tax contingent liability estimates prove to be inaccurate the resulting adjustments could be material to our future financial results

contingent liabilities  legal matters  we are subject to legal regulatory and other proceedings and claims we establish liabilities as appropriate for these claims and proceedings based upon the probability and estimability of losses and to fairly present in conjunction with the disclosures of these matters in our financial statements and sec filings management’s view of our exposure we review outstanding claims and proceedings with external counsel to assess probability and estimates of loss we reevaluate these assessments each quarter or as new and significant information becomes available to determine whether a liability should be established or if any existing liability should be adjusted the actual cost of resolving a claim or proceeding ultimately may be substantially different than the amount of the recorded liability in addition because it is not permissible under gaap to establish a litigation liability until the loss is both probable and estimable in some cases there may be insufficient time to establish a liability prior to the actual incurrence of the loss upon verdict and judgment at trial for example or in the case of a quickly negotiated settlement see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements

lease accounting and excess facilities  the majority of our stores are subject to shortterm leases usually with initial or primary terms of 3 to 5 years with multiple renewal options when available we also have stores subject to buildtosuit arrangements with landlords which typically carry a primary lease term of between 7 and 10 years with multiple renewal options approximately half of our stores have provisions for contingent rentals based upon a percentage of defined sales volume we recognize contingent rental expense when the achievement of specified sales targets is considered probable we recognize rent expense over the term of the lease we record minimum rental expense on a straightline basis over the base noncancelable lease term commencing on the date that we take physical possession of the property from the landlord which normally includes a period prior to store opening to make necessary leasehold improvements and install store fixtures when a lease contains a predetermined fixed escalation of the minimum rent we recognize the related rent expense on a straightline basis and record the difference between the recognized rental expense and the amounts payable under the lease as deferred rent we also receive tenant allowances which we record as deferred incentive rent and amortize as a reduction to rent expense over the term of the lease we reflect as a liability any difference between the calculated expense and the amounts actually paid improvements of leased properties are amortized over the shorter of the life of the applicable lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset

for store closures where a lease obligation still exists we record the estimated future liability associated with the rental obligation on the date the store is closed in accordance with sfas 146 “accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities” based on an overall analysis of store performance and expected trends management periodically evaluates the need to close underperforming stores liabilities are established at the point of closure for the present value of any remaining operating lease obligations net of estimated sublease income and at the communication date for severance and other exit costs as prescribed by sfas 146 key assumptions in calculating the liability include the timeframe expected to terminate lease agreements estimates related to the sublease potential of closed locations and estimation of other related exit costs if actual timing and potential termination costs or realization of sublease 

income differ from our estimates the resulting liabilities could vary from recorded amounts these liabilities are reviewed periodically and adjusted when necessary 

sharebased payments  our sharebased stock option awards are valued on an individual grant basis using the blackscholesmerton closed form option pricing model the application of this valuation model involves assumptions that are judgmental and highly sensitive in the valuation of stock options which affects compensation expense related to these options these assumptions include the term that the options are expected to be outstanding an estimate of the volatility of our stock price applicable interest rates and the dividend yield of our stock other factors involving judgments that affect the expensing of sharebased payments include estimated forfeiture rates of sharebased awards if our estimates differ materially from actual experience we may be required to record additional expense or reductions of expense which could be material to our future financial results

prior to february 4 2006 we accounted for sharebased payments using the intrinsicvaluebased recognition method prescribed by accounting principles board opinion 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” “apb 25” because stock options were granted at an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant employee compensation cost related to stock options generally was not reflected in our results of operations prior to the adoption of sfas 123r “sharebased payment” the compensation committee of our board of directors took action to accelerate the vesting effective february 3 2006 of most of our outstanding stock options granted prior to january 24 2006 the compensation committee took this action primarily to reduce noncash compensation expense to be recorded in future periods under the provisions of sfas 123r however the committee also believed this decision benefited employees

effective february 4 2006 we adopted sfas 123r using the modified–prospectivetransition method and began recognizing compensation expense for our sharebased payments based on the fair value of the awards on the grant date for the year ended february 2 2007 the adoption of the fair value method of sfas 123r resulted in additional sharebased compensation expense a component of sga expense and a corresponding decrease in income before income taxes of 36 million a decrease in net income of 22 million and a reduction in basic and diluted earnings per share of approximately 001

we estimate the fair value of stock options using the blackscholesmerton option pricing model for all option grants we estimate the expected term using a computation based on an assumption that outstanding options will be exercised approximately halfway through their contractual term taking into consideration such factors as grant date expiration date weightedaverage timetovest actual exercises and postvesting cancellations we calculate volatility assumptions using actual historical changes in the market value of the stock and implied volatility based upon traded options weighted equally we believe that this methodology provides the best indicator of future volatility

accounting pronouncements 

in july 2006 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued interpretation 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes” “fin 48” which will require companies to assess each income tax position taken using a twostep process a determination is first made as to whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained based upon the technical merits upon examination by the taxing authorities if the tax position is expected to meet the more likely than not criteria the benefit recorded for the tax position equals the largest amount that is greater than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement of the respective tax position the interpretation applies to income tax expense as well as any related interest and penalty expense

fin 48 requires that changes in tax positions recorded in a company’s financial statements prior to the adoption of this interpretation be recorded as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings for the period of adoption fin 48 will generally be effective for public companies for the first fiscal year beginning after december 15 2006 we anticipate adopting the provisions of this interpretation during the first quarter of fiscal 2007 no determination has yet been made regarding the materiality of the potential impact of this interpretation on our financial statements

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas 157 “fair value measurements” sfas 157 provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities the standard also requires expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value the information used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings the standard applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value the standard does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances sfas 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years we currently expect to adopt sfas 157 during our 2008 fiscal year no determination has yet been made regarding the potential impact of this standard on our financial statements

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans” which requires companies to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan other than a multiemployer plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income this statement also requires a company to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its yearend statement of financial position with limited exceptions a company with publicly traded equity securities is required to initially recognize the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan and to provide the required disclosures as of the end of the fiscal year ending after december 15 2006 and we have complied with these provisions to the extent material the second phase of sfas 158 includes a requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of a company’s fiscal yearend statement of financial position effective for fiscal years ending after december 15 2008 no final determination has yet been made regarding the timing or adoption of the second phase of sfas 158 on our consolidated financial statements however because we currently have one supplemental executive retirement plan with one executive participant the impact if any is expected to be minimal




 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

financial risk management 

we are exposed to market risk primarily from adverse changes in interest rates to minimize this risk we may periodically use financial instruments including derivatives as a matter of policy we do not buy or sell financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes and all financial instrument transactions must be authorized and executed pursuant to approval by the board of directors all financial instrument positions taken by us are used to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure because of high correlation between the financial instrument and the underlying exposure being hedged fluctuations in the value of the financial instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying economic exposure the financial instruments we use are straightforward instruments with liquid markets

we have cash flow exposure relating to variable interest rates associated with our revolving line of credit and tax increment financing and may periodically seek to manage this risk through the use of interest rate derivatives the primary interest rate exposure on variable rate obligations is based on the london interbank offered rate “libor” we were not party to any interest rate derivatives in 2006 or 2005

at february 2 2007 and february 3 2006 the fair value of our debt excluding capital lease obligations was approximately 2657 million and 2810 million respectively based upon the estimated market value of the debt at those dates the february 3 2006 amount is net of the fair value of a note receivable relating to the south boston virginia dc of approximately 495 million as further discussed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements such fair value exceeded the carrying values of the debt at february 2 2007 and february 3 2006 by approximately 140 million and 242 million respectively

based upon our variable rate borrowing levels a 1 adverse change in interest rates would have resulted in a pretax reduction of earnings and cash flows on an annualized basis of approximately 13 million in 2006 01 million in 2005 and less than 01 million in 2004 based upon our outstanding indebtedness at february 2 2007 and february 3 2006 a 1 reduction in interest rates would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our fixed rate debt of approximately 92 million and 122 million respectively

the compensation committee of our board annually reviews and recommends to the board the form and amount of director compensation more detail regarding this process is included in “compensation discussion and analysis” later in this report in recommending director compensation the committee endeavors to fairly compensate directors for their time and effort and to align directors’ interests with the longterm interests of our shareholders by including some form of equity accordingly we currently use a combination of cash and stockbased incentive compensation to attract and retain qualified board candidates our directors also are subject to a minimum share ownership requirement within 3 years of joining the board each director is required to own at least 13000 shares or share units of our common stock restricted stock units and stock options count towards these stock ownership requirements a director who also is a dollar general employee does not receive any separate compensation for board service

 directors also receive reimbursement for certain fees and expenses incurred in connection with continuing education seminars and travel expenses related to dollar general meeting attendance or dollar generalrequested appearances directors may travel on the dollar general airplane for those purposes 

equity compensation  we annually grant pursuant to our 1998 stock incentive plan 4600 restricted stock units “rsus” to each nonemployee director we generally make this grant immediately following the annual shareholders’ meeting however any director who is appointed or elected to our board after that shareholders’ meeting but before january 1 of the following year receives the grant upon his or her election or appointment while any director who is elected or appointed to our board after january 1 of that year but before our next annual shareholders’ meeting receives only the next scheduled annual grant all current directors other than messrs perdue and thornburgh received the 2006 annual grant on may 31 2006 mr thornburgh received his 2006 annual grant on july 24 2006 upon his appointment to our board mr clayton did not receive an annual grant for 2006 due to his retirement in may 2006

we credit dividend equivalents to the director’s rsu account as additional rsus in accordance with the terms of our 1998 stock incentive plan whenever we declare a dividend other than a stock dividend on our common stock directors do not have voting rights with respect to rsus until the underlying shares of common stock are issued

rsus generally vest one year after the grant date if the director is still serving on our board we do not however make payment on the vested units until the director has ceased to be a member of our board we accelerate the vesting of the units upon termination of a director’s board service due to death disability or normal retirement or upon a changeincontrol of dollar general or in the discretion of our compensation committee upon a potential changeincontrol 

our compensation committee determines the form of payment for rsus which may be made in shares of our common stock in cash or partly in cash and partly in stock to date all payments have been made in shares of our common stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares with limited exceptions the director may make an advance election to receive the payment either in one installment or in 10 or fewer annual installments and to receive the payment or begin the installments as soon as practicable after the director’s termination date on the first day of the calendar month beginning more than 6 months after the termination date or on the first anniversary of the termination date

deferred compensation program for nonemployee directors  nonemployee directors may defer up to 100 of eligible compensation paid by us to them pursuant to a voluntary nonqualified compensation deferral plan known as the deferred compensation plan for nonemployee directors “ddcp” eligible compensation includes the annual retainers meeting fees and any per diem compensation for special assignments earned by a director for service to the board or one of its committees we credit the deferred compensation to a liability account which is then invested at the director’s option in one or more accounts that mirror the performance of funds selected by our compensation committee or its delegate the “mutual fund options” or that mirrors the performance of our common stock the “common stock option” 

we generally distribute the amounts deferred at the director’s option in a lump sum or in monthly installments over a 5 10 or 15year period or a combination of both at the time

executive compensation 

compensation discussion and analysis 

who oversees the compensation of dollar general’s named executive officers 

throughout this document we refer to the individuals who served as our chief executive officer and chief financial officer during 2006 as well as the other individuals included in the summary compensation table as our “named executive officers” or “neos” our board of directors has a standing compensation committee which is responsible for among other things assisting the board in discharging its responsibilities relating to the compensation of directors and executive officers including the neos the committee operates pursuant to a written charter adopted by the board a current copy of which is available on the “investing – corporate governance” portion of our web site located at wwwdollargeneralcom and is available in print to any shareholder who requests it

does the committee have the ability to delegate any of its authority or responsibilities to other persons 

pursuant to the compensation committee charter the committee may delegate any of its responsibilities to one or more subcommittees as the committee deems appropriate during fiscal 2006 the committee did not delegate any of its responsibilities to a subcommittee

the compensation committee charter also delegates named fiduciary responsibility and responsibility for daytoday administration of certain of our benefits programs and plans to our benefits administration committee or bac which is composed of certain of our managementlevel employees the bac has the authority to make certain limited amendments modifications or supplements to our benefit plans trusts and related documents the board has adopted a charter to govern the bac and the members of the bac are appointed and removed by the committee the bac reports directly to the committee at least annually 

the compensation committee charter also authorizes the committee to delegate authority over the grant of equity awards to our ceo as authorized by the terms of our stock incentive plans our 1998 stock incentive plan provides that the committee can delegate authority to the ceo or to a committee composed of executive officers to grant on behalf of the committee nonqualified stock options exercisable at fair market value on the date of grant subject to any guidelines as the committee may determine from time to time the 1998 stock incentive plan provides however that

· 

options may only be granted pursuant to this delegated authority for the purposes specified by the committee which may include attracting new employees awarding outstanding performance or retaining employees 

· 

the committee shall specify the maximum number of shares that may be granted for purposes of attracting any single new employee at any specified level and the maximum number that may be granted to any other employee for any other purpose and 

· 

a report of each grant of an option pursuant to this delegated authority shall be presented to the committee at the first committee meeting following the grant 

during fiscal 2006 the committee did not delegate this authority to the ceo and all equity awards were granted solely by the committee except with respect to awards to the ceo which were granted or ratified by the independent directors upon the committee’s recommendation

does the committee have the authority to engage outside advisors 

pursuant to the compensation committee charter the committee has the sole authority to select retain and terminate any consulting firm engaged to assist in the evaluation of director ceo or other executive officer compensation and to approve that firm’s fees and other retention terms the committee also has the authority to conduct or authorize studies and investigations into any matters within the scope of its responsibilities and to retain outside legal or other advisors to assist in the conduct of those studies or investigations or for any other reason as the committee determines to be necessary or advisable the committee’s selection and use of outside advisors is discussed in more detail below

how often does the committee meet 

the committee generally meets in connection with each of the board’s regularlyscheduled meetings and at any additional times as it determines to be necessary or appropriate but not less than 4 times per year the committee met 9 times during fiscal 2006 

the committee is given the opportunity if it so desires at each regularly scheduled meeting to meet in private session without the presence of management in addition the committee is given the opportunity if it so desires at each quarterly meeting and at any other relevant meeting to meet in separate private sessions with each of the compensation consultant the evp of human resources and the general counsel

what are the philosophy and objectives of dollar general’s compensation programs for its neos 

the goals of our executive compensation strategy are to attract retain and motivate persons with superior ability to reward outstanding performance and to align the longterm interests of our officers with those of our shareholders our material compensation principles applicable to neos include the following

· 

generally total compensation should be targeted at the median total compensation of comparable positions at peer companies however because comparisons occasionally can be difficult due to the unique job description of some of our officers and the unique niche we play in the retail sector the committee may fairly account for distinct circumstances not reflected in the market data in addition competition for new talent may require total compensation or any component of total compensation to exceed the median 

· 

base salary should be reflective of the responsibilities of the position the experience and contributions of the individual and the salaries for comparable positions in the competitive marketplace the base salaries of our neos are subject to minimums set forth in their employment agreements 

· 

compensation arrangements shall emphasize pay for performance and encourage retention of those officers who enhance our performance 

· 

compensation arrangements shall promote ownership of our common stock to align the interests of management and shareholders 

· 

compensation arrangements shall maintain an appropriate balance between base salary and longterm and annual incentive compensation 

· 

in approving compensation the recent compensation history of the officer including special or unusual compensation payments shall be taken into consideration 

· 

cash incentive compensation plans for officers shall link pay to achievement of financial goals set in advance by the committee awards of incentive bonuses generally should be based on achieving corporate goals and on a subjective evaluation of the contributions of individual executives to the achievement of our business goals 

the committee reevaluates its compensation philosophy and principles at least annually typically several months in advance of the annual executive compensation review

does the committee use compensation consultants in determining or recommending the amount or form of executive and director compensation 

the committee believes that it is important to have the most timely accurate and insightful compensation advice and information that is available from independent sources these sources may include committee members’ experiences in an executive role with other organizations presentations by compensation consultants to other compensation committees on which committee members may serve information contained in professional literature regarding compensationrelated topics and various other sources that committee members may encounter the committee uses these independent sources to provide a frame of reference within which it can evaluate in an informed manner the advice given and recommendations made to the committee in connection with our specific compensation decisions

in april 2004 the committee selected hewitt associates as its compensation consultant hewitt which was selected by the committee after a thorough committeeled interview process that included other professional compensation consultants reports directly to the committee and has the authority and the ability to contact committee members directly committee members also may contact hewitt directly at any time and the committee has the opportunity at each regularly scheduled committee meeting to meet in private session with hewitt 

hewitt also provides consulting services to our human resources group both with respect to the work our management does in connection with neo and director compensation as described in greater detail below under “does management determine or recommend the amount or form of executive or director compensation” and in general employee compensation and benefits matters neither the committee nor hewitt believes that providing these services undermines in any way the independence of the advice or information provided to the committee

in fiscal 2006 the committee approved a written letter of agreement with hewitt this agreement describes the general terms of hewitt’s working relationship with management and the committee in particular hewitt performs executive compensation services as requested from time to time by management or the committee the agreement sets forth a wide range of potential work that hewitt may be requested to perform including competitive market pay analysis support with regard to relevant legal regulatory andor accounting considerations impacting compensation programs assistance with market data trends and competitive practices preparation for and attendance at selected management committee or board meetings and other miscellaneous work as requested 

does the committee use market benchmarking data in connection with its decisions regarding neo compensation 

our compensation philosophy recognizes the need to pay compensation that is competitive with the external talent market for senior executives in order to attract and retain neos who we believe will enhance our overall longterm business results the committee relies heavily on hewitt associates to analyze and present this market benchmarking information 

the committee has determined that the primary talent market for neo positions is retail companies with revenues similar to ours the committee directs hewitt to provide compensation data on all elements of compensation and on total compensation from its proprietary salary survey database as well as from the proxy statements of a group of 25 selected retail companies that meet this approximate revenue criteria we refer to this combined group throughout this cda as the market comparator group these companies are believed to compete with dollar general for neo level talent and have executive positions that are similar in breadth complexity and scope of responsibility to those of our neos the companies included in this market comparator group in 2006 are autozone barnes  noble bj’s wholesale club circuit city dillard’s family dollar foot locker kohl’s limited brands long drug stores nordstrom officemax office depot radioshack staples tjx companies jc penney the gap federated department stores blockbuster big lots ross stores petsmart retail ventures and payless shoesource the list of companies in the market comparator group is reviewed each year by the committee and changes are made as appropriate

the committee also asks hewitt to provide information from all other general industry companies for certain positions that are less specific to the retail industry and to serve as additional reference points in assessing the appropriateness of the compensation levels of all neo level positions

the market comparator group does not include all of the companies that are included in the sp 500 general merchandise store index because the committee believes that many of these companies are too large or too small to provide an appropriate comparison and that it is more appropriate to compare compensation of our neos with that of executives in companies that are more comparable in size in terms of revenue

does the committee provide employment contracts to neos 

the committee authorized an employment contract with mr perdue upon his hire in april 2003 thereafter beginning in 2004 the committee began offering employment contracts to all officers including the other neos the committee took this action because it believed based on benchmarking data it was a common protection offered to neos at other comparable companies and because contracts were needed to lockin members of a new management team to execute changes necessary to meet strategic objectives the committee also wanted to give standard protections to the neos as well as to dollar general from a competitive standpoint should the neo decide to leave our employ the committee approved revisions to these employment contracts for all neos other than the ceo in april of 2006 as follows

· 

contract term changed to 3 years instead of 2 years per common competitive practice 

· 

in addition to other severance payments and benefits an additional lump sum payment in an amount equal to 2 times the annual employer contribution to participation in our medical dental and vision benefits programs 

· 

in addition to other severance if any payments or benefits in connection with a changeincontrol would be subject to excise tax under federal income tax rules we have agreed to pay an additional amount to the neo to cover the excise tax and any resulting taxes however if after receiving this payment the neos aftertax benefit is not at least 25000 more than it would be without this payment then it will not be made and the severance and other benefits due will be reduced so that an excise tax is not incurred 

· 

changeincontrol triggers revised to be more consistent with the stock plan triggers and to remove the exclusion from the changeincontrol provisions ownership or acquisitions of our securities by cal turner jr james stephen turner members of their family or certain of their affiliates or associates 

· 

addition of target kmart walgreen’s rite aid and cvs to the list of named companies in the list of competitors for purposes of the noncompete provisions 

the committee also approved certain revisions to mr perdue’s contract in september 2006 as described below under “what are the terms of the extension of mr perdue’s contract”

where does the committee target neo compensation relative to the competitive market 

the committee believes that the median of the competitive market is the appropriate target for an neo’s total compensation however the target for each of the components of compensation relative to the competitive market varies 

in determining each neo’s specific compensation the committee starts with the competitive median the committee then considers any unique job responsibilities of any of our neos the importance of that role to dollar general and our specialized niche in the retail sector the committee working with hewitt tries to fairly account for these unique circumstances not reflected in the market benchmarking data

the committee then adjusts that compensation element upward or downward based on a variety of factors including the neo’s prior experience length of service compensation history and performance and the relation of the neo’s compensation to other executives and neos further competition for talent of a specific neo position may occasionally require total compensation or any component of total compensation to vary from the target   

does management determine or recommend the amount or form of executive or director compensation 

as discussed above the committee retains sole authority to determine executive officer compensation other than the ceo’s compensation which is approved by the independent directors of the board upon the committee’s recommendation the committee also recommends director compensation to the board the committee does however generally request that management assist hewitt associates in gathering and preliminarily analyzing relevant competitive data and identifying and preliminarily evaluating various compensation alternatives the committee also requests that management provide various coordination and administrative services such as preparing the agenda scheduling the meetings and distributing meeting materials in addition the evp of human resources normally meets with the committee chairperson prior to each meeting to discuss the agenda and meeting materials

the evp and vp of human resources regularly attend and participate in the committee meetings and the ceo attends part of most meetings other dollar general employees also may attend these meetings typically to make a special presentation record the meeting minutes or provide advice regarding legal requirements or implications none of these officers or employees attend the committee’s private sessions or the committee’s private session with hewitt unless the committee requests a joint private session with hewitt and select members of management

the ceo participates fully with the committee in assessing the performance of the executive officers and in making recommendations on the level of compensation for each pay component however the ceo is not present for any discussions concerning his own compensation 

while the committee welcomes and values the input of dollar general employees all decisions are made exclusively by the committee members and with the sole goal of managing 

executive officer and director compensation in the best interests of dollar general and our shareholders 

what are the elements of neo compensation and why does the committee choose to pay them 

we provide compensation in the form of base salary shortterm incentives longterm incentives benefits and perquisites as described in more detail below the committee believes that each of these elements is a necessary component of an neo’s overall compensation package and are consistent components of compensation programs at competing companies the committee reviews base salary shortterm incentives and longterm incentives at least annually and other elements periodically when material changes are considered these reviews include evaluating the relationship of each element to the competitive market the appropriate mix of each element in determining total compensation and the role of each element in addressing the principles and philosophy described above 

how is base salary determined 

in general the committee believes that base salary assists in fulfilling the recruiting and retention functions of our compensation principles by reflecting the responsibilities of the position the experience and contribution of the individual and the salaries for comparable positions in the competitive marketplace the committee believes that we would be unable to attract or retain quality neos in the absence of competitive base salary for this reason base salary constitutes a significant portion of an neo’s total compensation the base salary element also assists in fulfilling the pay for performance role of our compensation philosophy because neos are not eligible for any base salary increase or annual incentive payment unless they perform satisfactorily against their previously established individual performance goals

in determining each neo’s base salary the committee reviews the benchmarking data provided by hewitt as described above to determine comparable salaries for the position in the market the committee assesses the comparability of the duties and responsibilities of the position to those of the market positions and may adjust the median compensation value of the benchmark position up or down accordingly the committee then reviews the neo’s experience level and performance the relationship of the neo’s salary to that of the other neos and any other appropriate factor such as when the neo was hired or promoted and the relationship of the neo’s salary to that of the other neos and executives the summary compensation table contained in this report shows the amount of base salary earned by each neo in fiscal 2006

how were neo base salary adjustments determined in fiscal 2006 

individual performance goals are established each year for the ceo by the committee and for the other neos by the ceo in fiscal 2006 individual goals were based on the areas of our business for which the neo was responsible as well as overarching dollar general goals and initiatives including measures regarding dollar general growth revenue total sales same store sales new stores etc market share merchandising and marketing strategies shrink 

improvement inventory management distribution and capacity management new concept development leadership development succession planning diversity employee benefits turnover reduction and retention strategies workplace improvements customer satisfaction technology improvements internal controls legal and regulatory compliance and expense control

for each neo the committee approved the following base salary adjustments during fiscal 2006

· 

chairman and chief executive officer david a perdue  see separate ceo compensation section below

· 

executive vice president and chief financial officer david m tehle  the committee reviewed with mr perdue the objectives for mr tehle which included driving analysis and financial disciplines in the organization to drive value for the business the committee was satisfied with mr perdue’s evaluation of mr tehle’s performance deeming his performance to be satisfactory against his previously established goals and strategic initiatives and in accordance with base salary and shortterm incentive policies mr tehle was eligible in 2006 for both a base salary increase and participation in the shortterm incentive plan to the extent that we achieved our financial goals however mr tehle did not receive a base salary increase in 2006 because the committee had recently granted him a significant base salary increase of 221 effective december 2005 raising his base salary from 475000 to 580000 that increase resulted from a review of all neo compensation which occurred in conjunction with the hiring of a new neo it was determined that mr tehle’s salary was low in relation to the salary of the new neo given mr tehle’s role and impact on the organization the december 2005 salary increase was one of two special increases granted to neos in 2005 resulting from the special compensation review the other was to kathleen r guion discussed below 

· 

division president store operations and store development kathleen r guion  the committee reviewed with mr perdue the objectives for ms guion which included driving results in store operations and store development including the implementation of the major “ezstore” corporate initiative the committee was satisfied with mr perdue’s evaluation of ms guion’s performance deeming her performance to be satisfactory against her previously established goals and strategic initiatives and in accordance with base salary and shortterm incentive policies ms guion was eligible in 2006 for both a salary increase and participation in the shortterm incentive plan to the extent that we achieved our financial goals however ms guion did not receive a base salary increase in 2006 because the committee had recently granted her a significant base salary increase of 176 effective december 2005 raising her base salary from 425000 to 500000 for the same reasons noted above with respect to mr tehle’s base salary increase 

· 

division president merchandising marketing  supply chain beryl j buley  mr buley was hired on december 1 2005 and therefore was not considered for a base salary increase in 2006 

· 

executive vice president human resources challis m lowe  the committee reviewed with mr perdue the objectives for ms lowe which included recruiting a significant number of new executives and driving more analytical rigor in the human resources group in its support of the committee the committee was satisfied with mr perdue’s evaluation of ms lowe’s performance deeming her performance to be satisfactory against her previously established goals and strategic initiatives and in accordance with base salary and shortterm incentive policies ms lowe was eligible in 2006 for both a base salary increase and participation in the shortterm incentive plan to the extent that we achieved our financial goals the committee awarded ms lowe a 93 base salary increase raising her base salary from 375000 to 410000 effective april 1 2006 the committee made this decision as part of the normal merit review process primarily based on a review of her performance versus previously established goals and her impact on the organization the committee also noted that the base salary increase better aligned her salary with other neos and the competitive market for her position

how does the shortterm incentive plan work 

our shortterm incentive plan called teamshare was established under the shareholderapproved annual incentive plan payouts are designed to be deductible under section 162m of the internal revenue code

the committee believes the teamshare plan serves to motivate neos and all participants to achieve certain financial goals that are established by the committee at the start of the fiscal year as with base salary increases discussed above our neos are not eligible to receive a teamshare payout unless they perform satisfactorily against their individual performance goals even if our financial goals are attained accordingly the teamshare plan fulfills an important part of our pay for performance philosophy while at the same time aligning the interests of our neos with those of our shareholders it also provides compensation opportunities for our neos that are consistent with the compensation opportunities prevalent in the market comparator group and general industry thus helping to meet the recruiting and retention objectives of our compensation philosophy discussed above 

teamshare authorizes the payment of cash bonuses based on our actual performance measured against established business andor financial performance measures within 90 days of the start of each fiscal year the committee determines the employees who will be participants in teamshare and the performance goal or goals applicable to each chosen performance measure the relative weight of each performance measure if more than one is selected and each participant’s target bonus percentage no participant can receive a bonus under the plan in excess of 25 million for any fiscal year 

generally at its march committee meeting the committee determines whether and to what extent the performance goals have been satisfied for the prior year no bonus can be paid under the plan unless and until the committee certifies in writing that the previously established performance goals have been satisfied the committee may reduce or eliminate any bonus in its discretion despite achievement of the performance goal or goals but the committee may not increase the amount of bonus payable to an neo under teamshare the plan does not limit the 

committee’s ability to make discretionary payments or awards to employees including neos under any other plan or arrangement 

for fiscal 2006 the committee selected net income as the sole performance measure for determining payouts under the plan the committee selected this performance measure for 2006 because it believed that net income directly reflected several important business results such as performance against sales margin and expense targets and indirectly measures asset or inventory level controls also many of the companies in our market comparator group use net income as one of their measures of performance for bonus determinations 

the net income result needed to achieve a teamshare target payout was set to equal our annual financial objective as approved by the board of directors typically once the target has been set threshold and maximum performance levels are then set per competitive benchmarking data at approximately 90 and 110 of the financial target respectively however for 2006 the committee established the threshold performance level at 1 greater than the previous year’s actual net income result or approximately 93 of target net income and the maximum performance level at 110 of the 2006 net income target the threshold was set so that a teamshare bonus would not be earned unless our 2006 net income performance was at least equal to our 2005 net income performance

the committee determines the amount of each neo’s teamshare payout target based on benchmarking information provided by hewitt regarding competitive target incentives of comparable positions in the market comparator group and general industry the committee also sets the amounts of the threshold and maximum payout levels for performances below and above the target levels respectively with payouts prorated between threshold and maximum levels in relation to net income results 

at the march 2006 committee meeting hewitt advised that the typical payout structure used in the market comparator group and general industry is to set the target payout percentage at twice that of the threshold payout percentage and the maximum payout percentage at twice that of the target in order to adopt this more typical and competitive structure the committee set the maximum potential payout levels for neos other than the ceo see below at 130 of base salary for the 2006 fiscal year as opposed to 100 of base salary used in 2005 as a result the teamshare payout range for the neos other than the ceo see below was set at 325 of base salary threshold 65 of base salary target and 130 of base salary maximum

hewitt also advised at this meeting that the prior year’s teamshare target payout level of 80 of base salary for the ceo was low in relation to the market comparator group and general industry and that a target payout level of 100 of base salary was more typical as a result the committee recommended and the independent directors approved setting the ceo’s teamshare target payout level at 100 of base salary threshold payout level at 50 of base salary and the maximum payout level at 200 of base salary

what shortterm incentives were awarded to the neos in fiscal 2006 

for fiscal 2006 eligibility to receive a payout under teamshare was determined based on the following objective and subjective criteria a the individual’s achievement of a satisfactory performance rating when evaluated against his or her annually established performance 

objectives and b our achievement of net income goals established by the committee at the beginning of fiscal 2006 

as discussed above the fiscal 2006 performance of each neo was determined to be satisfactory qualifying each neo for a teamshare payout subject to the achievement of fiscal 2006 net income goals

based on performance with respect to our net income goal each neo could be eligible to receive the following teamshare awards a if we reached the “threshold” net income goal of 350154733 which was considered by the committee to be challenging then 325 50 for the ceo of salary was to be awarded b if we reached the “target” net income goal of 376895000 which was tied to dollar general’s financial target then 65 100 for the ceo of salary was to be awarded and c if we reached the “maximum” net income goal of 414584500 which was considered by the committee to be extremely difficult then 130 200 for the ceo of salary was to be awarded the percentage of salary awarded for net income performance falling between the “threshold” and “target” and the “target” and “maximum” goals was to be based on a graduated scale commensurate with net income results

because we did not meet our fiscal 2006 net income threshold goal neos did not receive payouts under our teamshare plan however over the course of the year it became clear that the teamshare net income goal was no longer a relevant measure of management’s success because of the impact of the critical strategic initiatives begun during the year these initiatives included changes to our merchandising markdown strategy changes to the real estate site selection strategy resulting in slowing the growth in store openings in favor of improved site quality changing sourcing and packaway strategies and closing a significant number of stores in underperforming locations

after extensive discussion and analysis and with the agreement of the full board of directors the committee determined that a discretionary bonus payout should be authorized outside of the annual teamshare bonus plan this discretionary bonus was made to recognize the significant restructuring and strategic efforts made by employees over the course of the year the committee believes that this action was necessary to align the fiscal 2006 shortterm performance incentive more closely to the revitalization strategy to reward critical employees for their accomplishments towards implementation of that revised strategy and to motivate and retain the neos and employees who are integral to the strategy’s continued successful execution 

after determining that a discretionary bonus should be made to substantially all employees who would otherwise have been eligible to participate in teamshare the committee decided to award each neo except the ceo see “how was the compensation for the ceo david a perdue determined” a 2006 discretionary bonus amount equal to the threshold amount that would have been paid under the teamshare plan these amounts are reflected in the “bonus” column of the summary compensation table set forth in this document

the committee also decided to reevaluate the use of net income as the sole performance measure for 2007 the committee planned to consider additional measures used by our competitor companies and which can be tied to accomplishing the milestones in the strategic initiatives that are underway however before this decision could be made we announced our pending acquisition by kkr and agreed to consult with kkr on significant changes to certain of our normal business practices kkr requested and the committee agreed to adopt earnings 

before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda as the sole performance measure for the 2007 teamshare plan the actual threshold target and maximum amounts are to be set in consultation with kkr before the end of april 2007

how does the longterm incentive program work 

the committee believes that longterm incentives are a critical part of the overall compensation package motivating executives to focus on achieving success for shareholders over the longterm these incentives thus assist in achieving a balance between shortterm and longterm goals and in aligning our neos’ interests with those of our shareholders our longterm incentives are delivered in the form of equity grants and are structured in such a way as to recognize increases or decreases in the stock price the committee targets a certain economic value to be delivered through the longterm incentives but the neo only realizes that targeted value if our stock price increases lesser increases or no increase in stock price will result in the neos receiving less than targeted value while greater stock price increases will result in the neos receiving above target value longterm incentives are also included in most compensation packages of the market comparator group as well as most other general industry companies furthering our program’s recruiting and retention objectives

the committee relies on the competitive compensation information from the market comparator group provided by hewitt associates this competitive information is used to establish longterm incentive target dollar amounts for each neo position the committee with hewitt’s assistance then determines the form in which the longterm compensation value should be delivered

the committee typically grants stock options and in some cases rsus annually to all eligible employees including the neos at its march meeting at this meeting the committee also reviews compensation benchmarking and other relevant information and evaluates the performance of our neos it is our practice to establish the exercise price of options as the closing market price on the date of the grant we typically release our annual earnings and other financial results shortly after this meeting however the grants are made prior to that release for the reasons stated above regardless of whether the earnings release will be favorable or unfavorable in accordance with our usual practice the fiscal 2007 annual equity grants to eligible employees were made at the march committee meeting except for grants to officers at the level of executive vice president or above which were made several days following that meeting after receiving the input and approval of kkr per the terms of the merger agreement

in addition to the annual equity grant to eligible employees the committee currently approves inducement option and rsu grants to new employees generally at the level of vice president or above those grants are made at the first committee meeting following the officer’s start date per the terms of the officer’s employment agreement in these cases also it is our practice to establish the exercise price of options as the closing market price on the grant date

pursuant to the merger agreement referenced above in part i item 1 “business” at the effective time of the merger each outstanding share of common stock of dollar general other than any shares held by any wholly owned subsidiary of dollar general and any shares owned by parent or merger sub or held by dollar general will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive 2200 in cash without interest in addition immediately prior to the effective time of 

the merger all shares of dollar general restricted stock and rsus will unless otherwise agreed by the holder and parent vest and be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration of 2200 per share of dollar general common stock all options to acquire shares of dollar general common stock will vest immediately prior to the effective time of the merger and holders of such options will unless otherwise agreed by the holder and parent be entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to the excess if any of the merger consideration of 2200 per share of dollar general common stock over the exercise price per share of dollar general common stock subject to the option

what longterm incentives were awarded to neos in fiscal 2006 

as a result of the competitive data provided by hewitt in fiscal 2006 and in the past the committee has been aware that our prior longterm incentive economic values have been well below those of the competitive market while considering what longterm incentive awards to grant in fiscal 2006 the committee decided that these values should be increased to be closer to the market in order to help retain our neos many of whom are relatively new 

in considering ways to increase these values the committee considered granting performancebased rsus in addition to the timevested stock options and rsus which have recently comprised the longterm component of neo compensation after studying this approach however the committee decided not to incorporate performancebased rsus into the 2006 longterm incentive component due to the difficulty inherent in setting goals three years into the future for a company undergoing transformation and implementing significant strategic change in making this decision the committee was able to draw upon its specific observations of other companies that implemented performancebased plans and the resulting demotivating impact caused by goals set three years into the future that could not be adjusted to recognize significant changes in the business or in the external environment without losing the tax deductibility of the incentive payments

at its march 2006 meeting the committee instead decided to increase the longterm compensation value for neos by approximately 2025 by increasing the economic value delivered by timevested stock options and rsus even with this increase in value longterm compensation for our neos continues to be below the comparative market median 

at the same time the committee also decided to change the allocation from the previous 8020 stock optionsrsus to 7030 stock optionsrsus which according to hewitt more closely aligns with market practice

the actual grant date fair value of the 2006 stock option and rsu awards and the number of options and shares awarded during 2006 to neos are presented in the grants of planbased awards table set forth in this report

at its january 2007 meeting the committee decided to further adjust the relationship of options and rsus to reflect a 5050 allocation of the economic value for longterm incentive grants made in fiscal 2007 this decision was based in part on the limited availability of shares for use as options under the current shareholderapproved option program and in part to position us for transitioning to a new compensation strategy that will be more effective in retaining key employees

what benefits and perquisites are available to neos 

we provide benefits and limited perquisites to neos for retention and recruiting purposes to promote tax efficiency for the neos and to replace benefit opportunities lost due to regulatory limits we also provide neos with these benefits and perquisites as additional forms of compensation that are believed to be consistent and competitive with benefits and perquisites provided to similar positions in the market comparator group and general industry the committee believes these benefits and perquisites are consistent with the compensation objectives described above as they help to attract and retain neos 

in addition to certain benefits offered to neos on the same terms that are offered to the salaried employee population such as our 401k match and health and welfare plans we provide neos the benefits and perquisites specified below

we offer to certain key employees including our neos except our ceo the compensation deferral plan the “cdp” and the defined contribution supplemental executive retirement plan the “serp” and together with the cdp the “cdpserp plan” our ceo mr perdue is eligible to participate in the cdp but not the serp we discuss in detail the cdpserp plan after the nonqualified deferred compensation table set forth in this report

we provide each neo with a life insurance benefit equal to 25 times his or her base salary to a maximum of 3000000 we pay the premiums and gross up the neo’s income to pay the tax cost of this benefit we also provide neos with a disability insurance benefit that provides income replacement of 60 of base salary to a maximum monthly benefit of 20000 25000 for the ceo we pay the cost of this benefit and gross up the neo’s income to pay the tax cost of this benefit to the extent necessary to replace benefit level caps in the group plan applicable to all salaried employees

further we provide each neo with a choice of either a leased automobile or a fixed monthly automobile allowance all of the neos except ms lowe chose the automobile allowance option under the leased option we provided ms lowe with a companyleased automobile and paid for her gasoline repairs service and insurance and provided a grossup payment to pay the tax cost of the imputed income the incremental costs we incurred related to these benefits in fiscal 2006 are reported in the “all other compensation” column of the summary compensation table set forth in this report

we also provide a relocation assistance program to neos similar to that offered to certain other employees the significant differences from the relocation assistance provided to other employees are as follows

· 

we provide a premove allowance of 5 of the neo’s annual base salary we cap this allowance at 5000 for other employees 

· 

we provide home sale assistance by offering to purchase the neo’s prior home at an independently determined appraised value in the event the prior home is not sold to an outside buyer we do not offer this service to other employees and 

· 

we reimburse neos for all reasonable and customary home purchase closing costs we limit our reimbursement to other employees to 2 of the purchase price to a maximum of 2000 

mr buley’s relocation to tennessee was completed in fiscal 2006 and the costs we incurred are reported in the “all other compensation” column of the summary compensation table set forth in this report 

as an exception to the normal neo relocation benefit the committee approved a onetime payment which was subsequently grossed up to pay the tax cost of the benefit to ms lowe for miscellaneous expenses she incurred in her relocation to tennessee these expenses were in lieu of normal home sale assistance and personal goods shipping costs that ms lowe did not incur in her relocation the committee believes that based on the experience of moving other executives had ms lowe incurred these normal relocation costs they would have been significantly in excess of this exception payment the amount of the costs we incurred and gross up are reported in the “all other compensation” column of the summary compensation table set forth in this report

the committee also approved an exception payment to ms guion to gross up the tax cost of relocation expenses she incurred that could not be deducted from her 2006 tax return since her move to tennessee did not occur until after the period in which these expenses could have been deducted the amount of the costs we incurred and the gross up payment is reported in the “all other compensation” column of the summary compensation table set forth in this report

we also provide to each neo other minor perquisites such as the opportunity to take an annual physical exam at our expense of up to 1000 occasional tickets to certain sporting or other entertainment events a holiday gift and golf or spa events in connection with our annual strategic planning meeting in addition we believe that our officers’ participation on nonprofit boards and in community events serves as a positive reflection upon dollar general and a great example of corporate leadership therefore we support nonprofit organizations for which our officers actively serve as a board or committee member with a maximum total contribution for all charities for which they serve to equal no more than 5000 

how was the compensation for the ceo david a perdue determined 

mr perdue’s compensation is determined by the independent directors of the board of directors considering the recommendations of the committee these recommendations are based upon a number of factors including benchmarking data provided by hewitt the current compensation and compensation history of mr perdue compared against those benchmarks and the achievement of financial and nonfinancial measures set by the committee as goals for mr perdue’s performance at the beginning of the year the results of the committee’s evaluation of mr perdue’s performance against those previously established goals determine mr perdue’s eligibility for changes in base salary and teamshare payout as with the other neos mr perdue’s compensation reflects an emphasis on achieving both short and longterm performance results a substantial portion of his compensation is tied directly to our overall financial performance as well as to nonfinancial measures including those derived from our mission statement 

in march 2006 the committee reviewed mr perdue’s performance against his previously established performance goals for fiscal 2005 in order to determine whether he was eligible for a base salary increase those previously established goals included measures relating to improvements in certain financial metrics earnings per share total sales growth same store sales growth operating margins return on invested capital free cash flow inventory turns and return on assets leadership development and succession strategic planning our growth new concept development distribution and capacity management inventory management shrink improvement workplace improvements turnover reduction and retention strategies third party relationships vendors analysts rating agencies media corporate governance and ethics legal matters and internal controls

the committee determined that under mr perdue’s leadership dollar general continued to remain true to each component of its mission of “serving others” as further discussed below

in fiscal 2005 we served our customers by providing consumable basic merchandise at everyday low prices in a convenient place to shop we continued to increase our efforts at finding products our customers need and making them available at competitive prices we also continued to open stores that will be convenient for our customers in their neighborhoods or towns opening 734 new stores 609 net including 29 new dollar general market ® stores 

also in fiscal 2005 we served our shareholders by remaining committed to our 3year strategic plan aimed at strengthening the organization improving store operation consistency and revitalizing merchandising initiatives as well as other initiatives to improve the organization’s financial health during fiscal 2005 a number of key executives were hired or promoted into positions of leadership to strengthen the organization and provide leadership for accomplishing our strategic plan by the end of fiscal 2005 we were on the road to improving store operations with nearly half of our stores operating as ezstores using newly engineered processes to run more effectively and efficiently also the year ended with increases in both total sales and same store sales during fiscal 2005 we significantly reduced aged inventory surpassing plan expectations and leading to an increase in inventory turns over the prior year total inventory per store was also down as a result of this initiative we generated approximately 350 million in net income and earnings per share of 108 and we opened an eighth distribution center in south carolina and began construction on a ninth in indiana free cash flow also jumped dramatically from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005 and capital expenditures were lower than plan 

finally in fiscal 2005 under mr perdue’s leadership employees were served through our ongoing commitment to our values including the highest degree of integrity providing opportunity for employee growth through the addition of more jobs additional stores and distribution centers and related promotional opportunities and specifically focusing on simplifying processes easing workloads in the store through ezstore

the committee was satisfied with mr perdue’s performance against his previously established goals and strategic initiatives and his achievement of established fiscal 2005 financial measures therefore in accordance with our base salary and shortterm incentive policies mr perdue was eligible in fiscal 2006 for both a salary increase and participation in the teamshare plan to the extent that we achieved our net income goals 

however in anticipation of mr perdue’s employment contract expiration on march 31 2007 in light of the plan to update all officer contracts effective april 1 2006 in recognition of his performance and in order to send mr perdue a clear and early message of the board’s intent to retain him the committee initiated discussions with mr perdue concerning an early renewal or extension of his contract these discussions culminated in the board’s september 18 2006 approval of an extension of mr perdue’s employment contract from march 31 2007 to march 31 2008 the details of the extended contract are described below in the section “what are the terms of the extension of mr perdue’s employment contract”

as a result of the decision to negotiate an extension of his employment contract the committee postponed a decision regarding mr perdue’s base salary and longterm incentive compensation at the regular executive compensation review session in march 2006 rather the committee decided to include those decisions in the negotiation process relating to the contract extension discussed further below

as described above the net income performance level required to qualify for a minimum incentive payout was not met and mr perdue did not receive a teamshare payout for fiscal 2006 the committee considered whether mr perdue should receive a discretionary bonus similar to the discretionary bonuses paid to other neos as part of its deliberations the committee gave particular weight to mr perdue’s request that he not receive a discretionary bonus in 2006 accordingly the committee recommended that mr perdue not receive a discretionary bonus and the independent directors of the board concurred

what additional benefits or perquisites are provided to the ceo 

mr perdue is eligible for all of the same benefits and perquisites and on the same basis and in the same amounts as the other neos except he is not eligible to participate in the serp described above due to his participation in an individual defined benefit serp mr perdue’s serp is a nonqualified unfunded pension plan the serp was provided to mr perdue as part of his inducement package to join dollar general in 2003 and was one of the components necessary at that time in attracting him as our ceo in accordance with our objective to attract persons with superior ability certain information regarding mr perdue’s serp is reflected in the pension benefits table set forth in this report which is followed by a description of the terms of this serp 

effective january 25 2006 the board approved the establishment of a grantor trust to hold certain assets in connection with mr perdue’s serp the grantor trust provides for assets to be placed in the trust upon an actual or potential changeincontrol as defined in the grantor trust the assets of the grantor trust are subject to the claims of our creditors in addition the grantor trust provides for a distribution to mr perdue to pay certain taxes in the event he is taxed in connection with the funding of the trust prior to the normal payment of his serp benefit the committee also deemed it appropriate in accordance with competitive practice to reimburse mr perdue for certain legal fees that he incurred as a result of the establishment of this grantor trust these fees are reported in the “all other compensation” column of the summary compensation table set forth in this report

potential benefits payable to mr perdue and additional information regarding the serp are presented and discussed in the pension benefits table and accompanying narrative included in this report

what are the terms of the extension of mr perdue’s employment contract 

mr perdue’s employment contract was scheduled to expire on march 31 2007 following lengthy negotiations the committee and mr perdue agreed on september 18 2006 to extend his contract to march 31 2008 during the negotiations the committee relied on the assistance of hewitt associates for advice and competitive compensation information to ensure that the contract extension was in the best interests of dollar general and those of our shareholders the committee also received internal and external legal advice on various technical matters relating to the contract extension and in documenting its terms

the terms of mr perdue’s employment contract extension are as follows

· 

base salary increase from 10 million to 11 million in order to bring his base salary to approximately the market median 

· 

bonus target payout increased from 80 to 100 of base salary bonus maximum payout increased from 130 to 200 of base salary bonus minimum payout to remain at 50 of base salary these changes were originally approved in march 2006 upon the recommendation of the committee and the approval of the full board for the reasons discussed above in the section “how does the shortterm incentive plan work” as applied to all other neos 

· 

a grant of 365000 rsus that will vest ratably over three years but are generally not payable until after mr perdue ceases to be employed by us this grant was made to target an economic value of approximately 43 million which is above the median of the market comparator group and general industry data provided by hewitt the committee believed it was necessary to provide above median longterm incentive compensation as an inducement for mr perdue to sign the contract extension also this above market compensation was provided in the form of equity compensation rather than cash compensation to ensure that mr perdue’s interests were appropriately aligned with shareholders the committee chose to deliver the longterm economic value in rsus because we were then preparing our november 2006 plans to revitalize our merchandising and real estate strategies and the committee did not believe it appropriate to issue stock options to the ceo shortly in advance of the public announcement of that revitalization strategy 

· 

the addition of a provision requiring that severance benefits be payable upon his termination if he resigns within 60 days after our failure to offer to renew the contract this change was approved to make mr perdue’s contract consistent with the contracts of all other officers in this regard 

· 

the removal of the exclusion from the changeincontrol provisions of the contract ownership or acquisitions of our securities by cal turner jr james stephen turner members of their family or certain of their affiliates or associates 

· 

a broadening of the list of competitors in the noncompete portion of the contract to include the same companies listed in the employment contracts of our executive vice presidents 

what compensation and benefits would be paid to neos upon the occurrence of various termination of employment events or upon a changeincontrol 

termination arrangements are provided to neos in case of termination in various situations to protect the employee against circumstances over which they have no control and as consideration for the promises of noncompete nonsolicit and noninterference that we require in employment agreements furthermore we provide termination payments in the case of a changeincontrol to align executive and shareholder interests by enabling neos to evaluate a transaction in the best interests of our shareholders and our other constituents without undue concern over whether the transaction may jeopardize the neo’s own employment in the case of a changeincontrol all equity awards and all cdpserp plan benefits are fully vested under a single trigger but termination benefits have a double trigger that requires both a changeincontrol and a loss of employment within two years after the event under various termination circumstances 

a table detailing the compensation and benefit payments that would be made to our neos had their employment terminated due to the occurrence of one of various events as of february 2 2007 is presented under “potential payments upon termination or changeincontrol” in this report the committee has reviewed the payouts that would occur and has determined that the total compensation that would be payable is reasonable 

the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement with affiliates of kkr will constitute a changeincontrol for purposes of our plans and arrangements

does the committee consider the deductibility of compensation in determining neo compensation 

section 162m of the internal revenue code generally disallows a tax deduction to public companies for compensation over 1 million paid in any fiscal year to an neo that is not performancebased compensation

the committee’s policy is generally to design compensation plans and programs to ensure full deductibility the committee attempts to balance this policy with compensation programs designed to retain and motivate neos to maximize shareholder value should the committee determine that the shareholders’ interests are best served by the implementation of compensation programs that are not deductible under section 162m the policy does not restrict the committee from approving such a compensation program even though that decision may result in a nondeductible compensation expense the committee’s decision to pay discretionary bonuses to neos other than the ceo for 2006 could have resulted in nondeductible compensation however these payments did not result in compensation in excess of 1 million for any neo 

our shareholders have approved our annual incentive plan pursuant to which performancebased annual cash bonuses can be awarded to neos currently under the teamshare plan the committee believes cash bonus compensation awarded under the annual incentive plan under the current structure satisfies the requirements of section 162m therefore compensation expense realized in connection with annual cash bonus compensation under the teamshare plan should be deductible 

our shareholders have also approved our 1998 stock incentive plan under which equity compensation such as stock options restricted stock and rsus is granted to neos the committee believes stock option grants made pursuant to the 1998 stock incentive plan under the current structure satisfy the requirements of section 162m therefore compensation expense realized in connection with stock options should be deductible however restricted stock or rsus granted to neos that vest over time are not performancebased compensation under section 162m so we are unable to deduct that compensation expense 

in addition we cannot deduct any salary signing bonuses or other annual compensation paid or imputed to the neo that causes nonperformancebased compensation to exceed the 1 million limit

conclusion 

the committee has carefully weighed its oversight responsibilities and believes it has fulfilled its obligation to shareholders as outlined in its philosophy and objectives as discussed above the committee further believes that the compensation benefit and perquisite programs outlined above for neos including the ceo are reasonable within benchmarking standards for comparable companies and in the best interest of shareholders

pension benefits 

fiscal 2006 

we provide retirement benefits to mr perdue under an unfunded nonqualified defined benefit pension plan or serp the table below shows the present value of accumulated benefits payable to mr perdue including the number of years of credited service earned by him under his serp the material terms of mr perdue’s serp are discussed following the table 

 

 mr perdue’s serp provides an annual normal retirement benefit equal to 25 of “final average compensation” upon retirement on or after his “normal retirement date” payable as a joint and 50 spouse annuity assuming the spouse is the same age as mr perdue mr perdue can elect to receive his benefit as a lump sum or any annuity form that is the actuarial equivalent of the normal retirement benefit

mr perdue can retire with an early retirement benefit any time after he has 10 years of credited service benefits are prorated based on actual credited service divided by 15 if mr perdue retires with less than 15 years of credited service in the event mr perdue retires prior to age 60 his benefit is reduced 5 for each year or portion thereof that his retirement age precedes age 60

if mr perdue separates for any reason prior to earning 10 years of credited service no benefits are payable from this plan subject to the following provisions

· 

upon disability under internal revenue code section 409aa2c mr perdue will be deemed to continue employment and receive his then base salary and “applicable annual bonus” until he has earned the full 25 maximum benefit 

· 

upon death mr perdue’s spouse will receive the 50 survivor portion of the benefit mr perdue would be entitled to receive based on “final average compensation” and years of credited service at the time of his death 

· 

upon termination by us without cause or termination by mr perdue for good reason within 2 years of a changeincontrol mr perdue is entitled to a benefit based on his years of credited service earned at the time of termination plus 5 additional years of credited service subject to the serp maximum of 15 years mr perdue’s base salary and “applicable annual bonus” will be deemed to be paid during the 5 additional years of credited service for calculating his “final average compensation” 

subject to any 6 month deferral in payment requirement for tax law compliance and subject to his providing a release of claims against us if and as required in his employment agreement mr perdue’s serp benefit commences on the first day of the calendar month on or after he ceases employment and is eligible for a benefit in the event of disability benefits begin at his “normal retirement date” assuming he continued to work until that date in the event of death the benefit is payable to the spouse on the first day of the month following the date of death

“applicable annual bonus” is the greater of the actual bonus paid for the immediately preceding fiscal year or the target annual bonus for the current fiscal year

“final average compensation” is calculated as mr perdue’s base salary plus his incentive “teamshare” bonus earned in a fiscal year for the highest 3 consecutive fiscal years of credited service out of the last 10 preceding retirement or termination of employment 

“normal retirement date” is the first of the month coincident with or next following the later of the date mr perdue attains age 60 or is credited with 15 years of credited service

we have established a grantor trust that provides for assets in connection with mr perdue’s serp to be placed in the trust upon an actual or potential changeincontrol as defined in the grantor trust of dollar general the trust’s assets are subject to the claims of dollar general’s creditors the trust also provides for a distribution to mr perdue to pay certain taxes in the event he is taxed in connection with the funding of the trust and prior to normal payment of his serp benefit

nonqualified deferred compensation 

fiscal 2006 

as discussed above we offer a cdpserp plan to certain key employees including the neos mr perdue is not eligible to participate in the serp portion of the cdpserp plan due to his participation in his individualized serp discussed under “pension benefits” above information regarding the neos’ participation in the cdpserp plan is included in the following table the material terms of the cdpserp plan are described after the table

 

pursuant to the cdp participants may annually elect to defer up to 65 of base salary and up to 100 of bonus pay participants make deferral elections in november of each year for amounts to be earned in the following year we currently match base pay deferrals at a rate of 100 up to 5 of annual salary with annual salary offset by the amount of matcheligible 

salary deferred into the 401k plan all participants are 100 vested in all compensation and matching deferrals and earnings on those deferrals

pursuant to the serp we make an annual contribution equal to a certain percentage of a participant’s annual salary and bonus to all participants who are actively employed in an eligible job grade on january 1 and continue to be employed as of december 31 of a given year the contribution percentage is based on age years of service and job grade the 2006 contribution percentage for each eligible named executive officer was 75 mr tehle 45 mr buley 45 ms guion and 75 ms lowe serp amounts generally vest at the earlier of the participant’s attainment of age 50 or the participant’s being credited with 10 or more “years of service” or upon termination of employment due to death or “total and permanent disability” or upon a “changeincontrol” all as defined in the cdpserp plan

 item 13 

certain relationships and related transactions and director independence 

a 

director independence the board of directors affirmatively determines the independence of each director and director nominee in accordance with guidelines it has adopted which include all elements of independence set forth in the new york stock exchange listing standards as well as certain boardadopted categorical independence standards these guidelines are contained in our corporate governance principles or with respect to interests of less than 1 of a publicly held vendor in our code of business conduct and ethics each of which is posted on the “investing—corporate governance” portion of our web site located at wwwdollargeneralcom

the board first analyzes whether any director has a relationship covered by section 303a02b or section 303a06 of the nyse listing standards that would prohibit an independence finding or with respect to section 303a06 would prohibit an independence finding for purposes of service on the audit committee only the board then analyzes any relationship of a director to dollar general or to our management that does not fall within the parameters set forth in the board’s separately adopted categorical independence standards to determine whether or not that relationship is material any director who has a material relationship is not considered to be independent

the board has determined that one or more relationships within the categories listed below are not considered to be material the board may determine that a director who has a relationship that falls outside of these parameters is nonetheless independent to the extent that the relationship would not constitute a bar to independence under the nyse listing standards as used in connection with these categorical standards “immediate family member” means a director’s spouse parents stepparents children stepchildren siblings mothers and fathersinlaw sons and daughtersinlaw brothers and sistersinlaw and anyone other than a domestic employee who shares that director’s home

certain relationships with vendors  a director’s independence is not impaired by the existence of any of the relationships listed below provided in each case that the director or immediate family member as applicable does not participate in the actual provision of services or goods to or negotiations with dollar general on the vendor’s behalf or receive any special compensation or other benefit as a result of the relationship

· 

the director is a current employee or an immediate family member is a current executive officer of a vendor if the amount we pay to the vendor or that the vendor pays to us in any of the vendor’s last 3 fiscal years does not exceed the greater of 1 million or 2 of the vendor’s consolidated gross revenues

· 

the director or an immediate family member directly or indirectly owns less than 10 of any class of securities of a vendor if 

Ö

Ö 

in the case of a lender the highest amount of our aggregate indebtedness to the lender outstanding during our fiscal year does not exceed the greater of 1 million or 2 of the lender’s total consolidated assets as of its last completed fiscal year 

provided however that these transaction limits do not apply in the case of ownership of less than 1 of a publicly held vendor which in all cases is deemed immaterial

certain relationships with nonprofit entities  a director’s independence is not impaired by the existence of any of the relationships listed below

· 

the director is a current employee or an immediate family member is a current executive officer of a taxexempt entity to which we make donations if the amount donated in the entity’s last fiscal year does not exceed the lesser of 120000 or 2 of the entity’s consolidated gross revenues 

· 

an immediate family member is employed in a capacity other than an executive officer by a taxexempt entity to which we make donations if the amount donated in the entity’s last fiscal year does not exceed the greater of 1 million or 2 of the entity’s consolidated gross revenues or 

· 

the director or an immediate family member serves as a director or trustee of a taxexempt entity to which we make donations if the amount donated in the entity’s last fiscal year does not exceed the greater of 1 million or 2 of the entity’s consolidated gross revenues in addition simultaneous service by a director or an immediate family member and a member of our management team or an immediate family member on the board of a taxexempt entity will not preclude a director’s independence 

certain relationships with auditors  a director’s independence is not impaired by the existence of a prior relationship with our independent auditing firm or a current relationship between an immediate family member and that auditing firm as long as 

· 

the director is not a current partner or employee and an immediate family member is not a current partner of that firm 

· 

an immediate family member is not a current employee of that firm who participates in the audit assurance or tax compliance but not tax planning practice and 

· 

the director or immediate family member was not within the last 3 years a partner or employee of that firm who personally worked on our audit within that time 

certain compensatory relationships  a director’s independence is not impaired by our employment of any of the director’s immediate family members in a capacity other than executive officer if the amount of compensation does not exceed 120000 during our fiscal year

the board of directors has affirmatively determined that messrs bottorff dickson gee purcell robbins thornburgh and wilds mss bowles and knuckles but not messrs perdue our ceo or beré our president and coo are independent from our management under both the nyse’s listing standards and our additional standards discussed above our board also previously determined that mr clayton who retired from our board in may 2006 was independent from our management during the period of time that he served as a director under both the nyse’s listing standards and our additional standards any relationship between an independent director and dollar general or our management were either encompassed by the categorical standards identified above or in the case of mr wilds discussed below deemed to be immaterial

overall business strategy 

dollar general’s mission statement is “serving others” to carry out this mission the company has developed a business strategy of providing its customers with a focused assortment of fairly priced consumable merchandise in a convenient smallstore format

our customers  the company serves the basic consumable needs of customers primarily in the low and middleincome brackets and those on fixed incomes according to ac nielsen’s 2005 homescan® data in 2005 approximately 48 of the company’s customers earned less than 30000 per year and approximately 26 earned less than 20000 per year the company’s merchandising and operating strategies are primarily designed to meet the need for basic consumable products of the consumers in these lower income groups

our stores  the traditional dollar general store has on average approximately 6800 square feet of selling space and generally serves customers who live within five miles of the store of the company’s 8019 stores operating as of march 3 2006 approximately 4580 serve communities with populations of 20000 or less the company believes that its target customers prefer the convenience of a small neighborhood store the company believes that dollar general’s convenient discount store format will continue to attract customers and provide the company with a competitive advantage 

in 2003 the company began testing a dollar general market concept dollar general markets are larger than the average dollar general store and carry among other items an expanded assortment of grocery products and perishable items at march 3 2006 the company’s 8019 total stores included 44 dollar general market stores with an average of 17400 square feet of selling space the company plans to open at least 30 dollar general market stores in 2006

our merchandise  the company is committed to offering a focused assortment of quality consumable merchandise in a number of core categories such as health and beauty aids packaged food and refrigerated products home cleaning supplies housewares stationery seasonal goods basic clothing and domestics this focused merchandise assortment allows customers to shop at dollar general stores for their everyday household needs in 2005 the average customer purchase was 903

our prices  the company distributes quality consumable merchandise at everyday low prices its strategy of a lowcost operating structure and a focused assortment of merchandise allows the company to offer quality merchandise at competitive prices as part of this strategy the company emphasizes evendollar prices on many of its items in the typical dollar general store the majority of the products are priced at 10 or less with approximately 30 of the products priced at 1 or less 

our cost controls  the company emphasizes aggressive management of its overhead cost structure additionally the company seeks to locate stores in neighborhoods where rental and operating costs are relatively low the company attempts to control operating costs by implementing new technology where feasible examples of this strategy in recent years include the implementation of “ezstore” the company’s initiative designed to improve inventory flow from distribution centers to consumers other improvements to the company’s supply chain and warehousing systems an automatic inventory replenishment system at the store level and the implementation of a new merchandise planning system designed to assist the company’s merchants with their purchasing and store allocation decisions

growth strategy 

the company has experienced a rapid rate of expansion in recent years increasing its number of stores from 5000 as of february 2 2001 to 8019 as of march 3 2006 in addition to growth from new store openings the company recorded samestore sales increases of 20 and 32 in 2005 and 2004 respectively samestore sales calculations for 2005 and prior include only those stores that were open both at the end of that period and at the beginning of the preceding fiscal year based on the comparable calendar weeks in the prior year as further described below in part ii item 7 2005 was a 53week accounting period while 2004 was a 52week accounting period accordingly the same store sales percentage for 2005 discussed above excludes sales from the 53 rd week as there was no comparable week in 2004 in addition the company has revised its method for determining the stores that are included in its publicly released samestore sales calculations beginning in 2006 management will continue to seek to grow the company’s business and believes that this future growth will come from a combination of new store openings infrastructure investments and merchandising initiatives each as discussed more fully below

new store growth  management believes that the company’s convenient smallstore format is adaptable to small towns and neighborhoods throughout the country the majority of the company’s stores are located in these small towns defined by the company as communities with populations of 20000 or less in 2005 slightly over half of the company’s new stores were opened in small towns while the remainder were opened either in rural or in more densely populated areas the company expects a similar mix of new store openings between small 

towns and other areas in 2006 new store openings in 2006 will include the company’s existing market area as well as certain other geographic areas where management believes the company has the potential to expand its store base opening stores in its existing market areas allows the company to take advantage of brand awareness and to maximize its operating efficiencies

in 2005 2004 and 2003 the company opened 734 722 and 673 new stores and remodeled or relocated 82 80 and 76 stores respectively the company currently plans to open approximately 800 new dollar general stores and at least 30 new dollar general market stores in 2006 some of the new dollar general markets may replace existing traditional stores

infrastructure investments  the company’s distribution network is an integral component of the company’s efforts to reduce transportation expenses and effectively support the company’s growth in recent years the company has made significant investments in its distribution network as of march 3 2006 the company operated eight distribution centers “dcs” one of which opened during 2005 the company’s ninth dc in marion indiana is expected to be completed and fully operational in mid2006 in addition the company is currently in the planning stages for its tenth dc also in recent years the company has expanded its dcs in south boston virginia and ardmore oklahoma by completing the conversion of these dcs from single to dual sortation systems which enables them to serve more stores

the company’s investments in technology in recent years are outlined below in 2005 new systems for store operating statements store labor scheduling supplier communications and transportation and claims management were installed in addition the company enhanced its store systems to sell dollar general gift cards in 2004 a merchandising data warehouse was added the rollout of creditdebit andor electronic benefit transfer “ebt” capabilities was completed and an automatic inventory replenishment system was installed in all stores in addition a new stock ledger and sales flash system were completed also for the first time store district managers were equipped with personal computers to enable them to access daily merchandising information in 2003 the company implemented an improved warehouse management system a dc appointment scheduling system and an inventory reconciliation system and completed allocation system improvements shortage analysis reporting and improvements to automated dc replenishment systems 

merchandising initiatives  the company’s merchandising initiatives are designed to promote samestore sales increases the company continually evaluates the performance of its merchandise mix and makes adjustments when appropriate in recent years the company has increased its emphasis on the highly consumable category by adding items in the food paper pet products household chemicals and health and beauty aids categories also in recent years the company began offering perishable products which include a selection of dairy products luncheon meats frozen foods and ice cream other recent initiatives include prepaid phone cards and branded apparel

beginning in the fourth quarter of 2003 and principally at the conclusion of the holiday selling season the company began taking endofseason markdowns materially in excess of what it had historically taken to appropriately value yearend inventory and to help dispose of certain holidayrelated items that had not sold in sufficient quantities prior to 2003 the 

company would have carried that inventory forward and would have attempted to adjust future inventory purchases to account for the carryover product in 2004 and 2005 the company again executed endofseason markdowns throughout the year as it deemed appropriate the company continues to aggressively identify evaluate merchandise and markdown aged inventory to minimize seasonal inventory carried forward to the next fiscal year

merchandise 

dollar general stores offer a focused assortment of quality merchandise in a number of core categories the company separates its merchandise into the following four categories for reporting purposes highly consumable seasonal home products and basic clothing the company maintains approximately 4600 core stockkeeping units “skus” per store

the percentage of total sales of each of the four categories tracked by the company for the preceding three years is as follows

 

of the four categories the seasonal category typically accounts for the highest gross profit rate and the highly consumable category typically accounts for the lowest gross profit rate 

the company purchases its merchandise from a wide variety of suppliers approximately 11 of the company’s purchases in 2005 were from procter and gamble no other supplier accounted for more than 3 of the company’s purchases in 2005 the company directly imported approximately 13 of its retail receipts in 2005 

through 2005 the company generally did not print weekly advertising circulars but instead advertised to support new traditional store openings primarily with targeted circulars and instore signage advertising expenses were less than 1 of sales in 2005 the company initiated a marketing program as the sponsor of a national association for stock car auto racing “nascar” busch series car the company participated in the busch series racing season which ran from february to november and served as the title sponsor of the dollar general 300 nascar busch series race at lowe’s motor speedway in concord north carolina 

seasonality 

the company’s business is modestly seasonal in nature the company expects to continue to experience seasonal fluctuations with a larger percentage of its net sales operating profit and net income being realized in the fourth quarter in addition the company’s quarterly results can be affected by the timing of new store openings and store closings the amount of sales contributed by new and existing stores as well as the timing of certain holidays the company purchases substantial amounts of inventory in the third quarter and incurs higher 

shipping costs and higher payroll costs in anticipation of the increased sales activity during the fourth quarter in addition the company carries merchandise during its fourth quarter that it does not carry during the rest of the year such as gift sets trimatree certain baking items and a broader assortment of toys and candy

the following table reflects the seasonality of net sales operating profit and net income by quarter all of the quarters reflected below are comprised of 13 weeks with the exception of the fourth quarter of the year ended february 3 2006 which was comprised of 14 weeks

 

the dollar general store 

the typical dollar general store is operated by a manager an assistant manager and two or more sales clerks approximately 52 of the company’s stores are located in strip shopping centers 46 are in freestanding buildings and 2 are in downtown buildings the company generally has not encountered difficulty locating suitable store sites in the past and management does not currently anticipate experiencing material difficulty in finding suitable locations

the company’s recent store growth is summarized in the following table

 

 employees 

as of march 3 2006 the company employed approximately 64500 fulltime and parttime employees including divisional and regional managers district managers store managers and dc and administrative personnel compared with approximately 63200 employees on april 1 2005 management believes the company’s relationship with its employees is generally good and the company is not a party to any collective bargaining agreements

competition 

the company operates in the discount retail merchandise business which is highly competitive with respect to price store location merchandise quality assortment and presentation instock consistency and customer service the company competes with discount stores and with many other retailers including mass merchandise grocery drug convenience variety and other specialty stores these other retail companies operate stores in many of the areas where the company operates and many of them engage in extensive advertising and marketing efforts the company’s direct competitors in the dollar store retail category include family dollar dollar tree fred’s and various local independent operators competitors from other retail categories include walmart and walgreens among others certain of the company’s competitors have greater financial distribution marketing and other resources than the company

the dollar store category differentiates itself from other forms of retailing by offering consistently low prices in a convenient smallstore format the company believes that its prices are competitive due in part to its low cost operating structure and the relatively limited assortment of products offered historically labor and marketing expenses have been minimized by fewer price points relying on simple merchandise presentation and limited marketing efforts the company attempts to locate primarily in secondtier locations either in small towns or in the neighborhoods of more densely populated areas where occupancy expenses are relatively low the company maintains a strong purchasing power position due to its leadership position in the dollar store retail category which centers on a focused assortment of merchandise

trademarks 

the company through its affiliate dollar general merchandising inc has registered with the united states patent and trademark office the trademarks dollar general® dollar general market® clover valley® american value® dg guarantee® and the dollar general price point designs along with certain other trademarks the company attempts to obtain registration of its trademarks whenever possible and to pursue vigorously any infringement of those marks

 item 1a 

risk factors 

the company encourages investors to carefully consider the risks described below and other information contained in this document when considering an investment decision with respect to dollar general’s securities additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to management or that management currently deems immaterial may also impair the company’s business operations any of the events discussed in the risk factors below may occur if one or more of these events do occur business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected in that instance the trading price of dollar general securities could decline and investors might lose all or part of their investment

the company’s business is moderately seasonal with the highest portion of sales occurring during the fourth quarter adverse events during the fourth quarter could therefore materially affect the company’s financial statements as a whole  the company realizes a significant portion of its net sales and net income during the christmas selling season in the fourth quarter in anticipation of this holiday the company purchases substantial amounts of seasonal inventory and hires many temporary employees a seasonal merchandise inventory imbalance could result if for any reason the company’s net sales during the christmas selling season were to fall below seasonal norms if such an imbalance were to occur more markdowns than anticipated might be required to minimize the imbalance the company’s profitability and operating results could be adversely affected by unanticipated markdowns and by lower than anticipated sales lower than anticipated sales in the christmas selling season would also negatively impact the company’s ability to leverage the increased labor costs

competition in the retail industry could limit the company’s growth opportunities and reduce its profitability  the company operates in the discount retail merchandise business which is highly competitive this competitive environment subjects the company to the risk of reduced profitability because of the lower prices and thus the lower margins required to maintain the company’s competitive position the company competes with discount stores and with many other retailers including mass merchandise grocery drug convenience variety and other specialty stores these other retail companies operate stores in many of the areas where the company operates the company’s direct competitors in the dollar store retail category include without limitation family dollar dollar tree fred’s and various local independent operators competitors from other retail categories include walmart and walgreens among others some of the company’s competitors utilize aggressive promotional activities advertising programs and pricing discounts and the company’s results of operations could be adversely affected if the company does not respond effectively to these efforts 

the discount retail merchandise business is subject to excess capacity and some of the company’s competitors are much larger and have substantially greater resources than the company the competition for customers has intensified in recent years as larger competitors such as walmart have moved into or increased their presence in the company’s geographic markets the company remains vulnerable to the marketing power and high level of consumer recognition of these major national discount chains and to the risk that these chains or others could venture into the “dollar store” industry in a significant way generally the company expects an increase in competition

the company’s financial performance is highly sensitive to changes in overall economic conditions that may impact consumer spending and the company’s costs of doing business  a general slowdown in the united states economy or rising personal debt levels may adversely affect the spending of the company’s consumers which would likely result in lower net sales than expected on a quarterly or annual basis economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as employment levels business conditions fuel and energy costs inflation interest rates and tax rates could also adversely affect the company’s business by reducing consumer spending or causing consumers to shift their spending to other products the company might be unable to anticipate these buying patterns and implement appropriate inventory strategies which would adversely affect its sales and gross profit performance in addition continued increases in fuel and energy costs would increase the company’s transportation costs and overall cost of doing business and could adversely affect the company’s financial statements as a whole 

natural disasters or unusually adverse weather conditions could adversely affect the company’s net sales and supply chain efficiency unusually adverse weather conditions natural disasters or similar disruptions especially during the peak christmas selling season but also at other times could significantly reduce the company’s net sales in addition these disruptions could also adversely affect the company’s supply chain efficiency and make it more difficult for the company to obtain sufficient quantities of merchandise from its suppliers

existing military efforts and the possibility of war and acts of terrorism could disrupt the company’s information or distribution systems or increase our costs of doing business existing us military efforts as well as the involvement of the united states in other military engagements or a significant act of terrorism on us soil or elsewhere could have an adverse impact on the company by among other things disrupting its information or distribution systems causing dramatic increases in fuel prices thereby increasing the costs of doing business or impeding the flow of imports or domestic products to the company 

the company’s business is dependent on its ability to obtain attractive pricing and other terms from its vendors  the company believes that it has generally good relations with its vendors and that it is generally able to obtain attractive pricing and other terms from vendors however if the company fails to maintain good relations with its vendors it may not be able to obtain attractive pricing with the consequence that its net sales or profit margins would be reduced also prolonged or repeated price increases of certain raw materials could affect our vendors’ product costs and ultimately the company’s profitability the company’s ability to pass on incremental pricing changes may be limited due to operational and competitive factors which could negatively affect the company’s profitability and sales 

the efficient operation of the company’s business is heavily dependent on its information systems  the company depends on a variety of information technology systems for the efficient functioning of its business the company relies on certain software vendors to maintain and periodically upgrade many of these systems so that they can continue to support the company’s business the software programs supporting many of the company’s systems were licensed to the company by independent software developers the inability of these developers or the company to continue to maintain and upgrade these information systems and software programs would disrupt or reduce the efficiency of the company’s operations if it were unable to convert 

to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner in addition costs and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology or with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems could also disrupt or reduce the efficiency of the company’s operations the company also relies heavily on its information technology staff if the company cannot meet its staffing needs in this area the company may not be able to fulfill its technology initiatives while continuing to provide maintenance on existing systems

the company is dependent upon the smooth functioning of its distribution network the capacity of its dcs and the timely receipt of inventory  the company relies upon the ability to replenish depleted inventory through deliveries to its dcs from vendors and from the dcs to its stores by various means of transportation including shipments by air sea and truck labor shortages in the transportation industry could negatively affect transportation costs in addition longterm disruptions to the national and international transportation infrastructure that lead to delays or interruptions of service would adversely affect the company’s business the company also may face difficulty in obtaining needed inventory from its vendors because of interruptions in production adverse weather conditions foreign trade restrictions or government regulations or for other reasons which would adversely affect the company’s sales moreover if the company were unable to achieve functionality of new dcs in the time frame expected the company’s ability to achieve the expected growth could be inhibited 

construction and expansion projects relating to the company’s dcs entail risks which could cause delays and cost overruns such as shortages of materials shortages of skilled labor or work stoppages unforeseen construction scheduling engineering environmental or geological problems weather interference fires or other casualty losses and unanticipated cost increases the completion dates and ultimate costs of these projects could differ significantly from initial expectations due to constructionrelated or other reasons the company cannot guarantee that any project will be completed on time or within established budgets 

the company’s success depends to a significant extent upon the abilities of its senior management team and the performance of its employees  the loss of services of key members of the company’s senior management team or of certain other key employees could negatively affect the company’s business the risk of key employee turnover intensifies as a greater number of public corporations locate in the vicinity of the company’s headquarters in addition future performance will depend upon the company’s ability to attract retain and motivate qualified employees to keep pace with its expansion schedule the inability to do so may limit the company’s ability to effectively penetrate new market areas also the company’s stores are decentralized and are managed through a network of geographically dispersed management personnel the inability of the company to effectively and efficiently operate its stores including the ability to control losses resulting from inventory and cash shrinkage may negatively impact the company’s sales andor operating margins

if the company cannot open new stores on schedule its growth will be impeded which would adversely affect sales  the company’s growth is dependent on both increases in sales in existing stores and the ability to open new stores delays in store openings could adversely affect the company’s future operations by slowing new store growth which may in turn reduce its revenue growth the company’s ability to timely open new stores and to expand into additional 

market areas depends in part on the following factors the availability of attractive store locations the ability to negotiate favorable lease terms the ability to hire and train new personnel especially store managers the ability to identify customer demand in different geographic areas general economic conditions and the availability of sufficient funds for expansion many of these factors are beyond the company’s control in addition the company may not anticipate all of the challenges imposed by the expansion of its operations and as a result may not meet its targets for opening new stores or expanding profitably 

the inability to execute operating initiatives could negatively affect the company’s future operating results  the company is involved in a significant number of operating initiatives that have the potential to be disruptive in the short term if they are not implemented effectively ineffective implementation or execution of some or all of these initiatives could also negatively impact the company’s operating results please reference the discussion of the initiatives in the “results of operations – executive overview” section included in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation” below

the company’s cost of doing business could increase as a result of changes in federal state or local regulations  unanticipated changes in the federal or state minimum wage or living wage requirements or changes in other wage or workplace regulations could adversely affect the company’s ability to meet financial targets in addition changes in federal state or local regulations governing the sale of the company’s products particularly “overthecounter” medications or health products could increase the company’s cost of doing business and could adversely affect the company’s sales results also the company’s inability to comply with these regulatory changes in a timely fashion or to adequately execute a required recall could result in significant fines or penalties that could affect the company’s financial statements as a whole 

unanticipated increases in insurance costs or loss experience could negatively impact profitability  the costs of some insurance workers’ compensation insurance general liability insurance health insurance and property insurance and loss experience have risen in recent years higher than expected increases in these costs or other insurance costs or unexpected escalations in the company’s loss rates could have an unanticipated negative impact on the company’s profitability

the company is subject to certain legal proceedings that may adversely affect its financial statements as a whole the company is involved in a number of legal proceedings which include for instance consumer employment tort and other litigation certain of these lawsuits if decided adversely to the company or settled by the company may result in liability material to the company’s financial statements as a whole or may negatively impact the company’s operating results if changes to the operation of the business are required please see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 below for further details regarding certain of these pending matters

the company may be unable to rely on liability indemnities given by foreign vendors which could adversely affect its financial statements as a whole the company imports approximately 13 of its merchandise globally sources of supply may prove to be unreliable or the quality of the globally sourced products may vary from the company’s expectations the 

company’s ability to obtain indemnification from the manufacturers of these products may be hindered by the manufacturers’ lack of understanding of us product liability laws which may make it more likely that the company may have to respond to claims or complaints from its customers as if the company were the manufacturer of the products any of these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business and its financial statements as a whole

the company is subject to interest rate risk which could impact profitability  the company is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on its financing investing and cash management activities changes in interest rates could have an unanticipated negative impact on the company’s profitability

purpose of discussion  we intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our company and the critical economic factors that affect our company in addition we hope to help the reader understand our financial statements the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year and the primary factors that accounted for those changes as well as how certain accounting principles affect our financial statements 

executive overview 

dollar general corporation “dollar general” or the “company” is the largest dollar store discount retailer of consumable basics in the united states with over 8000 stores we are committed to serving the needs of low middle and fixedincome customers however the company sells quality private label and national brand products that appeal to a wide range of customers our merchandise is priced at competitive everyday low prices that do not change frequently as a result of promotional activity we believe many of our customers shop at dollar general because they trust us to consistently stock quality merchandise at low prices we also believe convenience or the ability to complete a shopping trip in a limited amount of time is critical to many of our customers and is a key factor that differentiates us from largebox retailers 

we operate in the highly competitive retail industry we face strong sales competition from other retailers that sell general merchandise and food because of dollar general’s lowprice strategy we must strive to keep our operating costs as low as possible this effort affects all expenses but is particularly critical as we compete for retail site locations and for qualified talent to manage and operate our stores the fact that many of our stores are located in towns that many retailers may find too small to support their business model however has allowed dollar general to continue to increase its store count faster than most retailers

management of the company continues to focus on making good investment decisions for the longterm growth and profitability of the company in order to better support sales efforts in our stores and to enable the company to continue its rapid growth the company has 

attempted to strengthen the senior leadership team over the last several years in 2005 changes were made to the organization structure in order to increase synergies between store operations and new store development and among merchandising marketing and the supply chain executives were added to support our efforts in human resources real estate store operations supply chain and the dollar general market concept going forward the company expects these new leaders to have a positive impact on the overall performance and profitability of the company

along with other retail companies we are impacted by a number of factors including but not limited to cost of product consumer debt levels economic conditions customer preferences unemployment labor costs inflation fuel prices weather patterns insurance costs and accident costs 

key items in fiscal 2005 despite a difficult economic environment for our customers in 2005 the company successfully implemented many of the important operating initiatives outlined in last year’s form 10k while also increasing sales and earnings per share the following are some of the more significant accomplishments during the year

·

total sales increased by 120 percent including sales during the 53rd week and samestore sales increased by 20 percent 

·

we opened 734 new stores including 29 dollar general market stores 

·

we implemented “ezstore” the company’s initiative designed to improve inventory flow from distribution centers to consumers as well as improve other areas of store operations including labor scheduling hiring and training and product presentation in 3825 stores as of yearend 

·

we completed construction of and opened the company’s eighth dc in south carolina and began construction of a ninth dc in indiana to increase overall distribution capacity and to decrease stem miles between the dcs and the stores 

·

we increased annual inventory turns to 42 times in 2005 including the 53 rd week from 40 times in 2004 and reduced inventory levels on a perstore basis by 1 as of year end the company has executed endofseason markdowns over the past two years to minimize seasonal inventory carried forward to the following year the company made substantial progress on this initiative in 2005 and continues to aggressively identify evaluate merchandise and markdown aged inventory 

·

we introduced dollar general gift cards before the christmas holiday season 

·

we introduced fisherprice® branded children’s apparel and bobbie brooks® apparel for women in our stores 

·

we developed and installed new systems to provide enhanced store operating statements supplier communications and transportation and claims management and 

·

we generated sufficient cash flow to allow the company to repurchase approximately 15 million shares of its common stock for 2976 million and to increase our per share dividend to shareholders by over 9 

the company believes its 2005 sales particularly in more discretionary higher gross profit categories were negatively impacted by the effect on its typical low to middleincome customer of high gasoline and heating fuel prices as well as higher interest rates and increasing 

consumer debt levels the company’s gross profit rate was negatively impacted for the year by several factors as further discussed in “results of operations” below but was most notably affected by the decrease as a percentage of sales in sales of higher gross profit merchandise categories and higher transportation fuel costs 

in 2005 hurricanes katrina and rita made landfall in the gulf coast impacting our operations our customers and our employees at the peak approximately 350 stores were temporarily closed due to hurricane katrina and 330 stores were temporarily closed due to hurricane rita the company ultimately closed 41 stores as a result of the hurricanes and suffered the total destruction of inventory in 29 of those stores due to hurricane katrina and 3 of those stores due to hurricane rita significant losses of inventory and fixed assets in the form of store fixtures and leasehold improvements were caused by the hurricanes these losses were offset by insurance proceeds received during the year in addition the company expects to record additional insurance proceeds in excess of the cost of the asset losses in the future significant business interruption was experienced during the hurricanes the company did not recover any business interruption insurance proceeds during the year and will not record any such proceeds until the business interruption claims are substantially settled

company performance measures management uses a number of metrics including those indicated on the table included in “results of operations” below to assess its performance the following are the more frequently discussed metrics

 

·

earnings per share “eps” growth is an indicator of the increased returns generated for the company’s shareholders eps of 108 in 2005 reflected an increase of 38 percent over eps of 104 reported in 2004 

·

total net sales growth indicates among other things the success of the company’s selection of new store locations and merchandising strategies total net sales increased 120 in 2005 including the impact of the 53 rd week 

·

samestore sales growth indicates whether our merchandising strategies store execution and customer service in existing stores have been successful in generating increased sales samestore sales increased 20 percent in 2005 with stronger samestore sales in the first half of the year than the latter half sales were negatively impacted for the year by the economic factors discussed above however the latter half of the year was increasingly impacted by promotional efforts of competitors samestore sales in 2004 increased by 32 percent 

·

operating margin rate operating profit divided by net sales which is an indicator of the company’s success in leveraging its fixed costs and managing its variable costs declined to 65 percent in 2005 versus 73 percent in 2004 the various components impacting this metric are fully discussed in “results of operations” below 

·

free cash flow the sum of net cash flows from operating activities net cash flows from investing activities and net cash flows from financing activities excluding share repurchases and changes in debt other than required payments although this measure is a nongaap measure the company believes it is useful as an indicator of the cash flow generating capacity of the company’s operations it is also a useful metric to analyze in conjunction with net income to determine whether there is any significant noncash component to the company’s net income the company 

generated free cash flow of 2509 million in 2005 compared to 962 million in 2004 as calculated below under “nongaap disclosures”

·

inventory turns cost of goods sold for the year divided by average inventory balances at cost measured at the end of the latest five fiscal quarters is an indicator of how well the company is managing the largest asset on its balance sheet inventory turns were 42 times in 2005 including the 53 rd week compared to 40 times in 2004 

·

return on average assets net income for the year divided by average total assets measured at the end of the latest five fiscal quarters is an overall indicator of the company’s effectiveness in deploying its resources return on assets was 121 percent in 2005 and 127 percent in 2004 

while the company is particularly pleased with the improvement in inventory management and free cash flow generation we did not achieve our overall internal financial goals set out at the beginning of the year this shortfall was partially a result of noncontrollable economic and other factors that impacted our customers as a result of the company’s inability to achieve its financial targets executives and administrative employees did not earn a bonus under the company’s “teamshare” bonus program the company has identified the following opportunities aimed at improving financial performance in 2006

key items for fiscal 2006 for 2006 the company has established the following priorities and initiatives aimed at continuing the company’s growth and improving its operating and financial performance while remaining focused on serving its customers

·

improvement in sales performance of samestores and new stores through new merchandise additions improved instore presentation and heightened promotional energy aimed at increasing customer traffic and average customer ticket the company plans to strengthen its “treasure hunt” offering and to execute a variety of new marketing promotional andor advertising strategies the company will also implement a new store floor plan in all new stores emphasizing improved merchandising adjacencies operational efficiencies and customer service and will continue efforts referred to as “project gold standard” begun in 2005 to improve the shopability and financial performance of existing stores 

·

further development of the dollar general market concept 

·

continued investment in ezstore further reducing store labor and related costs with the goal of completing the rollout by the end of 2006 

·

increased efforts to control inventory shrink in the stores which remains above acceptable levels as a percentage of sales 

·

opening a minimum of 800 new traditional dollar general stores while continuing to pursue further geographical expansion with increased emphasis on site selection approval processes and lowering rent as a percentage of sales in new and existing stores and 

·

continued investment in the company’s infrastructure including increasing global sourcing further developing our information technology capabilities and opening the company’s ninth distribution center thereby expanding distribution capacity 

the company can provide no assurance that it will be successful in executing these initiatives nor can the company guarantee that the successful implementation of these initiatives will result in superior financial performance 

results of operations 

the following discussion of the company’s financial performance is based on the consolidated financial statements set forth herein the following table contains results of operations data for the 2005 2004 and 2003 fiscal years and the dollar and percentage variances among those years 

 

a

the fiscal year ended february 3 2006 is comprised of 53 weeks

net sales  increases in 2005 net sales resulted primarily from opening additional stores including 609 net new stores in 2005 and a samestore sales increase of 20 for 2005 compared to 2004 samestore sales calculations for 2005 and prior include only those stores that were open both at the end of that period and at the beginning of the preceding fiscal year samestore sales increases are calculated based on the comparable calendar weeks in the prior year accordingly the same store sales percentage for 2005 discussed above excludes sales from the 53 rd week as there was no comparable week in 2004 the increase in samestore sales accounted for 1442 million of the increase in sales stores opened since the beginning of 2004 as well as the 1629 million impact of the 53 rd week of sales in fiscal year 2005 for all stores were the primary contributors to the remaining 7771 million sales increase during 2005 the increase in samestore sales is primarily attributable to an increase in average customer purchase 

the company has recently revised and published its method for determining the stores that are included in the company’s publicly released samestore sales calculations beginning in fiscal 2006 the company now provides samestore sales calculations for those stores that have been open at least 13 full fiscal months and remain open at the end of the reporting period using the revised methodology the samestore sales increase in 2005 was 22

the company monitors its sales internally by the four major categories noted in the table above the company’s merchandising mix in recent years has shifted to fasterturning consumable products versus seasonal home products and clothing this has been driven by customer wants and needs in the marketplace as a result over the past three years the highly consumable category has become a greater percentage of the company’s overall sales mix while the percentages of the seasonal home products and basic clothing categories have declined accordingly the company’s sales increase by merchandise category in 2005 compared to 2004 was primarily attributable to the highly consumable category which increased by 7814 million or 162 the company believes that future sales growth is dependent upon an increase in the number of customer transactions as well as an increase in the dollar value of the average transaction the company continually reviews its merchandise mix and strives to adjust it when deemed necessary as a part of its ongoing efforts to improve overall sales and gross profit these ongoing reviews may result in a shift in the company’s merchandising strategy which could increase permanent markdowns in the future 

the company’s sales increase in 2004 compared to 2003 resulted primarily from opening additional stores including 620 net new stores in 2004 and a samestore sales increase of 32 for 2004 compared to 2003 the increase in samestore sales accounted for 2040 million of the increase in sales while stores opened since the beginning of 2003 were the primary contributors to the remaining 5850 million sales increase during 2004 the company’s sales increase in 2004 was primarily attributable to the highly consumable category which increased by 6182 million or 147

gross profit  the gross profit rate declined by 82 basis points in 2005 as compared with 2004 due to a number of factors including but not limited to lower sales as a percentage of total sales in the company’s seasonal home products and basic clothing categories which have higher than average markups an increase in markdowns as a percentage of sales primarily as a result of the company’s initiative to reduce perstore inventory higher transportation expenses 

primarily attributable to increased fuel costs an increase in the company’s shrink rate and an estimated 52 million reduction resulting from the expansion of the number of departments utilized for the gross profit calculation from 10 to 23 as further described below under “critical accounting policies and estimates” these factors were partially offset by higher average markups on the company’s beginning inventory in 2005 as compared with 2004 in 2005 and 2004 the company experienced inventory shrinkage of 322 and 305 respectively

the gross profit rate increased 17 basis points in 2004 as compared with 2003 although the company’s gross profit rate was pressured by sales mix shifts to more highly consumable items which typically carry lower gross profit rates the company was able to more than offset this through increases in gross markups on all merchandise categories in 2004 more specific factors include higher initial markups on merchandise received during 2004 as compared with 2003 achieved primarily from the positive impact of opportunistic purchasing renegotiating product costs with several key suppliers selective price increases and an increase in various performancebased vendor rebates and higher average markups on the company’s beginning inventory in 2004 as compared to 2003 which represents the cumulative impact of higher margin purchases over time these components of gross profit which positively impacted the company’s results were partially offset by an increase in transportation expenses as a percentage of sales resulting primarily from higher fuel costs in 2004 as compared to 2003 and a nonrecurring favorable inventory adjustment in 2003 of 78 million representing a change in the company’s estimated provision for shrinkage

selling general and administrative “sga” expense  the 10 basis point decrease in sga expense as a percentage of sales in 2005 as compared with 2004 was due to a number of factors including but not limited to the following expense categories that either declined or increased less than the 120 increase in sales employee incentive compensation expense decreased 378 based upon the company’s fiscal 2005 financial performance professional fees decreased 323 primarily due to the reduction of consulting fees associated with the ezstore project and 2004 fees associated with the company’s initial sarbanesoxley compliance effort and employee health benefits decreased 100 due in part to a downward revision in claim lag assumptions based upon review and recommendation by the company’s outside actuary and decreased claims costs as a percentage of sales partially offsetting these reductions in sga were current year increases in store occupancy costs increased 176 primarily due to rising average monthly rentals associated with the company’s leased store locations and store utilities costs increased 227 primarily related to increased electricity and gas expense

the increase in sga expense as a percentage of sales in 2004 as compared with 2003 was due to a number of factors including but not limited to increases in the following expense categories that were in excess of the 115 percent increase in sales store occupancy costs increased 174 primarily due to rising average monthly rentals associated with the company’s leased store locations purchased services increased 546 due primarily to fees associated with the increased customer usage of debit cards professional fees increased 1192 primarily due to consulting fees associated with both the company’s 2004 ezstore project and compliance with certain provisions of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and inventory services increased 882 due to both an increased number of physical inventories and a higher average cost per physical inventory partially offsetting these increases was a 

reduction in accruals for employee bonus expenses declined 213 primarily related to higher bonus expense in 2003 resulting from the company’s financial performance during 2003

penalty expense  during 2003 the company recorded a charge of 100 million relating to a civil penalty resulting from its agreement in principle with the securities and exchange commission “sec” staff to settle the matters arising out of a restatement of the company’s financial statements for fiscal years 2001 and prior

interest income the increase in interest income in 2005 compared to 2004 is due primarily to higher interest earned on shortterm investments due to increased interest rates on shortterm borrowings the increase in interest income in 2004 compared to 2003 is due primarily to interest income on certain notes receivable purchased in may 2003 relating to the company’s south boston dc as further discussed below under liquidity and capital resources

interest expense  the decrease in interest expense in 2005 is primarily attributable to a reduction in tax related interest expense of 14 million principally due to the reversal of interest accruals pertaining to certain income tax related contingencies that were resolved during 2005 the decrease in interest expense in 2004 compared to 2003 is due primarily to capitalized interest of 36 million related to the company’s dc construction and expansion projects in 2004 compared to 02 million in 2003 and a reduction in amortization of debt issuance costs of 22 million due in part to the amendment of the company’s revolving credit facility in june 2004 the company had variablerate debt of 145 million as of february 3 2006 the remainder of the company’s outstanding indebtedness at february 3 2006 and all of its outstanding indebtedness at january 28 2005 was fixed rate debt

income taxes  the effective income tax rates for 2005 2004 and 2003 were 357 356 and 373 respectively 

while the 2005 and 2004 rates were similar overall the rates contained offsetting differences nonrecurring factors causing the 2005 tax rate to increase when compared to the 2004 tax rate include a reduction in federal jobs credits of approximately 10 million additional net foreign income tax expense of approximately 08 million and a decrease in the contingent income tax reserve due to resolution of contingent liabilities that is 36 million less than the decrease that occurred in 2004 nonrecurring factors causing the 2005 tax rate to decrease when compared to the 2004 tax rate include the recognition of state tax credits of approximately 23 million related to the company’s construction of a dc in indiana and a nonrecurring benefit of approximately 26 million related to an internal restructuring that was completed during 2005 excluding the nonrecurring items the 2005 effective tax rate would have been approximately 365

the 2004 rate was lower than the 2003 rate primarily due to the reversal of certain contingent income tax liabilities of approximately 62 million in 2004 when the company adjusted its tax contingency reserve based upon the results of two state income tax examinations the tax rate in 2003 was negatively impacted by the 100 million penalty expense in 2003 as discussed above which was not deductible for income tax purposes

in 2005 the company recognized a reduction in its federal income tax expense of approximately 45 million for federal jobs related tax credits of this amount approximately 39 million relates to the work opportunity tax credit wotc the welfare to work credit wtw and the native american employment credit the federal law that provided for the wotc and wtw credit programs expired on december 31 2005 for employees hired after that date credits can continue to be earned in 2006 for eligible employees that were hired prior to the december 31 2005 date the federal law that provided for the native american employment credit expired for years beginning after december 31 2005 the company’s 2006 year without regard to when the employee was hired the company currently anticipates that congress will renew these credit programs on a retroactive basis however renewal cannot currently be assured should these credit programs not be renewed the company currently anticipates a reduction in its 2006 credits of approximately 31 million

liquidity and capital resources 

current financial condition  recent developments  during the past three years the company has generated an aggregate of approximately 146 billion in cash flows from operating activities during that period the company has expanded the number of stores it operates by approximately 30 over 1800 stores and has incurred approximately 713 million in capital expenditures primarily to support this growth also during this threeyear period the company has expended approximately 537 million for repurchases of its common stock and paid dividends of approximately 156 million

the company’s inventory balance represented approximately 49 of its total assets as of february 3 2006 the company’s proficiency in managing its inventory balances can have a significant impact on the company’s cash flows from operations during a given fiscal year for example in 2005 changes in inventory balances represented a much less significant use of cash 979 million as explained in more detail below as compared to changes in inventory balances in 2004 2194 million use of cash

as described in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements the company is involved in a number of legal actions and claims some of which could potentially result in material cash payments adverse developments in those actions could materially and adversely affect the company’s liquidity the company also has certain income taxrelated contingencies as more fully described below under “critical accounting policies and estimates” estimates of these contingent liabilities are included in the company’s consolidated financial statements however future negative developments could have a material adverse effect on the company’s liquidity see notes 4 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements

on september 30 2005 november 30 2004 and march 13 2003 the board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to 10 million 10 million and 12 million shares respectively of its outstanding common stock these authorizations allow or allowed as applicable for purchases in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time subject to market conditions the objective of the company’s share repurchase initiative is to enhance shareholder value by purchasing shares at a price that produces a return on investment that is greater than the companys cost of capital additionally share repurchases generally are undertaken only if such purchases result in an accretive impact on the companys 

fully diluted earnings per share calculation the 2005 authorization expires september 30 2006 the 2004 and 2003 authorizations were completed prior to their expiration dates during 2005 the company purchased approximately 150 million shares pursuant to the 2005 and 2004 authorizations at a total cost of 2976 million during 2004 the company purchased approximately 110 million shares pursuant to the 2004 and 2003 authorizations at a total cost of 2093 million during 2003 the company purchased approximately 15 million shares pursuant to the 2003 authorization at a total cost of 297 million share repurchases in 2005 increased diluted earnings per share by approximately 001

the following table summarizes the company’s significant contractual obligations as of february 3 2006 in thousands

 

in fiscal year 2005 the company’s south carolinabased wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary ashley river insurance company “aric” had cash and cash equivalents and investments balances held pursuant to south carolina regulatory requirements to maintain 30 of aric’s liability for insurance losses in the form of certain specified types of assets and as such these investments are not available for general corporate purposes at february 3 2006 these cash and cash equivalents and investments balances totaled 434 million 

the company has a 250 million revolving credit facility the “credit facility” which expires in june 2009 as of february 3 2006 the company had no outstanding borrowings or standby letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility outstanding standby letters of credit reduce the borrowing capacity of the credit facility the credit facility contains certain financial covenants the company was in compliance with all these financial covenants at february 3 2006 see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the credit facility

the company has 200 million principal amount of 8 58 unsecured notes due june 15 2010 this indebtedness was incurred to assist in funding the company’s growth interest on the notes is payable semiannually on june 15 and december 15 of each year the company may seek from time to time to retire the notes through cash purchases on the open market in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise such repurchases if any will depend on 

prevailing market conditions the company’s liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors the amounts involved may be material

in july 2005 as an inducement for the company to select marion indiana as the site for construction of a new dc the economic development board of marion approved a tax increment financing in the amount of 145 million which matures february 1 2035 pursuant to this financing proceeds from the issuance of certain revenue bonds were loaned to the company in connection with the construction of this dc the variable interest rate on this loan is based on the weekly remarketing of the bonds which are supported by a bank letter of credit and ranged from 352 to 460 in 2005

significant terms of the company’s outstanding debt obligations could have an effect on the company’s ability to incur additional debt financing the credit facility contains financial covenants which include limits on certain debt to cash flow ratios a fixed charge coverage test and minimum allowable consolidated net worth the credit facility also places certain specified limitations on secured and unsecured debt the company’s outstanding notes discussed above place certain specified limitations on secured debt and place certain limitations on the company’s ability to execute saleleaseback transactions the company has generated significant cash flows from its operations during recent years the company had peak borrowings under the credit facility of 1003 million during 2005 and 731 million during 2004 all of which were repaid prior to february 3 2006 and january 28 2005 respectively and had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility at any time during 2003 therefore the company does not believe that any existing limitations on its ability to incur additional indebtedness will have a material impact on its liquidity notes 5 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements contain additional disclosures related to the company’s debt and financing obligations

at february 3 2006 and january 28 2005 the company had commercial letter of credit facilities totaling 1950 million and 2150 million respectively of which 851 million and 988 million respectively were outstanding for the funding of imported merchandise purchases

during 2005 the company incurred significant losses caused by hurricane katrina primarily inventory and fixed assets in the form of store fixtures and leasehold improvements the company has received insurance proceeds of 80 million due to these losses and has utilized a portion of these proceeds to replace lost assets the company expects to receive additional insurance proceeds due in part to significant business interruption experienced during the hurricanes the company did not recover any business interruption proceeds during 2005 and will not record any such proceeds until the business interruption claims are substantially settled losses related to inventory are included in cash flows provided by operating activities while losses related to fixed assets are included in cash flows used in investing activities the insurance proceeds approximated the amount of losses recorded by the company resulting in no material impact on reported 2005 net income

the company believes that its existing cash balances 2006 million at february 3 2006 cash flows from operations 5555 million generated in 2005 the credit facility 250 million available at february 3 2006 and its anticipated ongoing access to the capital markets if 

necessary will provide sufficient financing to meet the company’s currently foreseeable liquidity and capital resource needs

cash flows provided by operating activities  cash flows from operating activities for 2005 compared to 2004 increased by 1640 million the most significant component of the increase in cash flows from operating activities in the 2005 period as compared to the 2004 period was the changes in inventory balances seasonal inventory levels increased by 10 in 2005 as compared to a 22 increase in 2004 home products inventory levels increased by 2 in 2005 as compared to a 16 increase in 2004 while basic clothing inventory levels declined by 5 in 2005 as compared to a 21 increase in 2004 total merchandise inventories at the end of 2005 were 147 billion compared to 138 billion at the end of 2004 a 71 percent increase overall but a 1 decrease on a per store basis reflecting the company’s focus on lowering its per store inventory levels in connection with this effort the company has completed an initiative of identifying specific merchandise in its stores that it intends to sell via promotional discounts to customers some of these items have already been marked down and some may require additional markdowns in future periods the future rate of sales of this merchandise will be a key determinant of the rate of future markdowns

cash flows from operating activities for 2004 compared to 2003 declined by 1226 million the most significant component of the change in cash flows from operating activities was an increase in inventory levels in 2004 total merchandise inventories at the end of 2004 were 138 billion compared to 116 billion at the end of 2003 a 19 percent increase or a 9 percent increase on a per store basis with the remainder primarily attributable to growth in the number of stores the largest portion of the increase in inventories resulted from the company’s focus on improving instock levels of core merchandise at the stores new initiatives including the expansion of the perishable food program and the addition of certain core apparel items magazines and hispanic food items also contributed to the inventory increase in addition due to an early easter in 2005 the company received more seasonal merchandise for spring 2005 before the end of fiscal 2004 cash flows in 2004 increased by 453 million over 2003 related to changes in income taxes payable primarily due to a large payment of federal income taxes for 2002 that was made in 2003 cash flows in the 2004 period were positively impacted by an increase in net income of 452 million driven by improved operating results as more fully discussed above under “results of operations”

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures in addition to the estimates presented below there are other items within the company’s financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed critical as defined below the company believes these estimates are reasonable and appropriate however if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used the resulting changes could have a material effect on the financial statements taken as a whole 

management believes the following policies and estimates are critical because they involve significant judgments assumptions and estimates management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the company’s board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosures presented below relating to them

merchandise inventories merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined using the retail lastin firstout “lifo” method under the company’s retail inventory method “rim” the calculation of gross profit and the resulting valuation of inventories at cost are computed by applying a calculated costtoretail inventory ratio to the retail value of sales the rim is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality also it is recognized that the use of the rim will result in valuing inventories at the lower of cost or market if markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories

inherent in the rim calculation are certain significant management judgments and estimates including among others initial markups markdowns and shrinkage which significantly impact the gross profit calculation as well as the ending inventory valuation at cost these significant estimates coupled with the fact that the rim is an averaging process can under certain circumstances produce distorted cost figures factors that can lead to distortion in the calculation of the inventory balance include

·

applying the rim to a group of products that is not fairly uniform in terms of its cost and selling price relationship and turnover 

·

applying the rim to transactions over a period of time that include different rates of gross profit such as those relating to seasonal merchandise 

·

inaccurate estimates of inventory shrinkage between the date of the last physical inventory at a store and the financial statement date and 

·

inaccurate estimates of lower of cost or market “lcm” andor lifo reserves 

to reduce the potential of such distortions in the valuation of inventory the company’s rim calculation through the end of 2004 utilized 10 departments in which fairly homogenous classes of merchandise inventories having similar gross profit rates were grouped in 2005 in order to further refine its rim calculation the company expanded the number of departments it utilizes for its gross profit calculation from 10 to 23 the impact of this change on the company’s consolidated statement of income for 2005 was an estimated reduction of gross profit and a corresponding decrease to inventory at cost of 52 million other factors that reduce potential distortion include the use of historical experience in estimating the shrink provision see discussion below and the utilization of an independent statistician to assist in the lifo sampling process and index formulation also on an ongoing basis the company reviews and evaluates the salability of its inventory and records lcm reserves if necessary

the company calculates its shrink provision based on actual physical inventory results during the fiscal period and an accrual for estimated shrink occurring subsequent to a physical inventory through the end of the fiscal reporting period this accrual is calculated as a percentage of sales and is determined by dividing the booktophysical inventory adjustments recorded during the previous twelve months by the related sales for the same period for each store beginning in 2003 in an effort to improve this estimate the company began applying storespecific shrink rates to storespecific sales generated subsequent to a given store’s physical inventory prior to 2003 the company applied a weightedaverage shrink rate to all company sales generated subsequent to physical inventories during 2005 in an attempt to further refine its shrink accrual the company changed from a storelevel shrink accrual to a store and departmentlevel shrink accrual to the extent that subsequent physical inventories yield different results than this estimated accrual the company’s effective shrink rate for a given reporting period will include the impact of adjusting the estimated results to the actual results although the company performs physical inventories in all of its stores on an annual basis the same stores do not necessarily get counted in the same reporting periods from year to year which could impact comparability in a given reporting period

during 2003 the company implemented an itemlevel perpetual inventory system this system provides better information regarding the type of inventory that the company owns and improves the company’s ability to estimate its shrink provision as discussed above the utilization of this improved information in the company’s rim calculation resulted in a nonrecurring inventory adjustment of approximately 78 million which favorably impacted gross profit in the third quarter of 2003

property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost the company groups its assets into relatively homogeneous classes and generally provides for depreciation on a straightline basis over the estimated average useful life of each asset class except for leasehold improvements which are amortized over the shorter of the applicable lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset the valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful depreciable lives involves significant judgments and the use of estimates property and equipment are reviewed for impairment periodically and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable

insurance reserves the company retains a significant portion of the risk for its workers’ compensation employee health insurance general liability property loss and automobile coverage these costs are significant primarily due to the large employee base and number of stores provisions are made to this insurance liability on an undiscounted basis based on actual claim data and estimates of incurred but not reported claims developed by an independent actuary utilizing historical claim trends if future claim trends deviate from recent historical patterns the company may be required to record additional expenses or expense reductions which could be material to the company’s future financial results

contingent liabilities – income taxes  the company is subject to routine income tax audits that occur periodically in the normal course of business the company estimates its contingent income tax liabilities based on its assessment of probable income taxrelated exposures and the anticipated settlement of those exposures translating into actual future liabilities the contingent liabilities are estimated based on both historical audit experiences with various state and federal taxing authorities and the company’s interpretation of current income taxrelated trends if the company’s income tax contingent liability estimates prove to be inaccurate the resulting adjustments could be material to the company’s future financial results

contingent liabilities  legal matters the company is subject to legal regulatory and other proceedings and claims reserves if any are established for these claims and proceedings based upon the probability and estimability of losses and to fairly present in conjunction with the disclosures of these matters in the company’s financial statements and sec filings management’s view of the company’s exposure the company reviews outstanding claims and proceedings with external counsel to assess probability and estimates of loss these assessments are reevaluated each quarter or as new information becomes available to determine whether a reserve should be established or if any existing reserve should be adjusted the actual cost of resolving a claim or proceeding ultimately may be substantially different than the amount of the recorded reserve in addition because it is not permissible under gaap to establish a litigation reserve until the loss is both probable and estimable in some cases there may be insufficient time to establish a reserve prior to the actual incurrence of the loss upon verdict and judgment at trial for example or in the case of a quickly negotiated settlement see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements

lease accounting the majority of the company’s stores are subject to shortterm leases usually with initial or primary terms of three to five years with multiple renewal options when available the company also has stores subject to buildtosuit arrangements with landlords which typically carry a primary lease term of between 7 and 10 years with multiple renewal 

options approximately half of the company’s stores have provisions for contingent rentals based upon a percentage of defined sales volume the company recognizes contingent rental expense when the achievement of specified sales targets are considered probable rent expense is recognized over the term of the lease the company records minimum rental expense on a straightline basis over the base noncancelable lease term commencing on the date that the company takes physical possession of the property from the landlord which normally includes a period prior to store opening to make necessary leasehold improvements and install store fixtures when a lease contains a predetermined fixed escalation of the minimum rent the company recognizes the related rent expense on a straightline basis and records the difference between the recognized rental expense and the amounts payable under the lease as deferred rent the company also receives tenant allowances which are recorded in deferred incentive rent and are amortized as a reduction to rent expense over the term of the lease any difference between the calculated expense and the amounts actually paid are reflected as a liability improvements of leased properties are amortized over the shorter of the life of the applicable lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset

impairment of longlived assets when indicators of impairment are present the company evaluates the carrying value of longlived assets other than goodwill in relation to the operating performance and future undiscounted cash flows or the appraised values of the underlying assets the company may adjust the net book value of the underlying assets based upon such cash flow analysis compared to the book value and may also consider appraised values assets to be disposed of are adjusted to the fair value less the cost to sell if less than the book value the company also records impairment charges to reduce the carrying value of certain of its stores’ assets as deemed necessary due to negative sales trends and cash flows

effects of inflation 

the company believes that inflation andor deflation had a minimal impact on its overall operations during 2005 2004 and 2003

accounting pronouncements 

in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 123r “sharebased payment” which will require an entity to measure compensation cost for all sharebased payments including grants of employee stock options at fair value the company will adopt sfas no 123r during the first quarter of 2006 and expects to apply the standard using the modified prospective method which requires compensation expense to be recorded for new and modified awards and also for unvested portions of previously issued and outstanding awards the company expects to incur incremental selling general and administrative expense associated with the adoption of approximately 5 million in 2006 dependent upon the number of grants and their related fair market values see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for disclosure of the pro forma effects of stock option grants as determined using the methodology prescribed under sfas no 123

sfas 123r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow as 

required under current literature this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption while the company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on among other things when employees exercise stock options the amounts of operating cash flows recognized in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows for such excess tax deductions were 65 million 97 million and 146 million for 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively

on january 24 2006 the compensation committee “committee” of the company’s board of directors approved the acceleration of vesting for 64 million of the company’s outstanding stock options awarded prior to august 2 2005 this acceleration was effective on february 3 2006 vesting was not accelerated for stock options held by the ceo and stock options granted in 2005 to the officers of the company at the level of executive vice president or higher in addition pursuant to that committee action the vesting of all outstanding options granted on or after august 2 2005 but prior to january 24 2006 other than options granted during that time period to the officers of the company at the level of executive vice president or higher accelerated effective as of the date that is six months after the applicable grant date certain options granted on january 24 2006 to certain newly hired officers below the level of executive vice president were granted with a sixmonth vesting period the decision to accelerate the vesting of stock options was made primarily to reduce noncash compensation expense that would have been recorded in future periods following the adoption of sfas no 123r in the first quarter of fiscal year 2006 this action is expected to enable the company to eliminate approximately 28 million of expense before income taxes over the four year period during which the stock options would have vested subject to the impact of additional adjustments related to the forfeiture of certain stock options the company also believes this decision benefits employees in connection with the acceleration and in accordance with the provisions of apb 25 the company recorded compensation expense of 09 million before income taxes during 2005

in march 2005 the fasb issued fasb interpretation 47 “accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations” “fin 47” which is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after december 15 2005 this interpretation clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in fasb statement no 143 “accounting for asset retirement obligations” refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of settlement thus the timing and or method of settlement may be conditional on a future event accordingly an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated the fair value of a liability for the conditional asset retirement obligation should be recognized when incurred—generally upon acquisition construction or development and or through the normal operation of the asset uncertainty about the timing and or method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists statement 143 acknowledges that in some cases sufficient information may not be available to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation this interpretation also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation the company adopted the 

provisions of fin 47 during the fourth quarter of 2005 and this adoption did not have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements as a whole 

nongaap disclosures 

the company has included in this document free cash flow generated in 2005 and 2004 free cash flow is a measure not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” the company believes that this information is useful to investors as an indicator of the cash flow generating capacity of the company’s operations it is also a useful metric to analyze in conjunction with net income to determine whether there is any significant noncash component to the company’s net income this information should not be considered a substitute for any measures derived in accordance with gaap management may use this information to better understand the company’s underlying operating results a reconciliation of the company’s calculation of free cash flow to the most comparable measure derived in accordance with gaap is set forth below

 




 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

financial risk management 

the company is exposed to market risk primarily from adverse changes in interest rates to minimize such risk the company may periodically use financial instruments including derivatives as a matter of policy the company does not buy or sell financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes and all financial instrument transactions must be authorized and executed pursuant to approval by the board of directors all financial instrument positions taken by the company are used to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure because of high correlation between the financial instrument and the underlying exposure being hedged fluctuations in the value of the financial instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying economic exposure the financial instruments used by the company are straightforward instruments with liquid markets

the company has cash flow exposure relating to variable interest rates associated with its revolving line of credit and tax increment financing and may periodically seek to manage this risk through the use of interest rate derivatives the primary interest rate exposure on variable 

rate obligations is based on the london interbank offered rate “libor” the company was not party to any interest rate derivatives in 2005 or 2004

at february 3 2006 and january 28 2005 the fair value of the company’s debt excluding capital lease obligations was approximately 2810 million and 2759 million respectively net of the fair value of a note receivable on the south boston virginia dc of approximately 495 million and 500 million respectively as further discussed in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements based upon the estimated market value of the debt at those dates such fair value exceeded the carrying values of the debt at february 3 2006 and january 28 2005 by approximately 242 million and 327 million respectively

based upon the company’s variable rate borrowing levels a 1 adverse change in interest rates would have resulted in a pretax reduction of earnings and cash flows on an annualized basis of approximately 01 million in 2005 and less than 01 million in 2004 in 2003 the company had no outstanding variable rate borrowings based upon the company’s outstanding indebtedness at february 3 2006 and january 28 2005 a 1 reduction in interest rates would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of the company’s fixed rate debt of approximately 122 million and 142 million respectively

to move toward larger “supercenter” type stores which are often built outside of towns the company believes that dollar general’s convenient discount store format will continue to attract customers and provide the company with a competitive advantage

growth strategy 

the company has experienced a rapid rate of expansion in recent years increasing its number of stores from 4294 as of january 28 2000 to 7494 as of april 1 2005 in addition to growth from new store openings the company recorded samestore sales increases of 32 and 40 in 2004 and 2003 respectively samestore sales increases are calculated based on the comparable calendar weeks in the prior year samestore sales calculations for a given period include only those stores that were open both at the end of that period and at the beginning of the preceding fiscal year management will continue to seek to grow the company’s business and believes that this future growth will come from a combination of new store openings infrastructure investments and merchandising initiatives

new store growth  management believes that the company’s convenient smallstore format is adaptable to small towns and neighborhoods throughout the country the majority of 

the company’s stores are located in these small towns defined by the company as communities with populations of 20000 or less in 2004 slightly over half of the company’s new stores were opened in small towns while the remainder were opened outside of towns or in more densely populated areas the company expects a similar mix of new store openings between small towns and other areas in 2005 new store openings in 2005 will include the company’s existing market area as well as new geographic areas where management believes the company has the potential to expand its store base opening stores in its existing market area allows the company to take advantage of brand awareness and to maximize its operating efficiencies

in 2004 the company expanded its operating area to include wisconsin arizona and new mexico states which management believes are competitively underserved and offer the potential for additional growth for the company as of april 1 2005 the company had 55 stores in wisconsin 29 stores in arizona and 24 stores in new mexico the company expects to continue to explore the potential for expansion into additional geographic markets as opportunities present themselves 

in 2004 2003 and 2002 the company opened 722 673 and 622 new stores and remodeled or relocated 80 76 and 73 stores respectively the company currently expects to open approximately 700 new dollar general stores and at least 30 new dollar general market stores in 2005 some of the new dollar general markets will be conversions of traditional stores

infrastructure investments  in recent years the company has made significant investments in its distribution network as of april 1 2005 the company operated seven distribution centers “dcs” the company’s eighth dc near jonesville south carolina is expected to be completed and fully operational in mid2005 in addition the company plans to select a site for and begin construction of its ninth dc during 2005 the company’s distribution network is an integral component of the company’s efforts to reduce transportation expenses and effectively support the company’s growth in addition the company has recently expanded its dcs in south boston virginia and ardmore oklahoma and has substantially completed the conversion of these dcs from single to dual sortation systems which enables them to serve more stores as of april 1 2005 each of the company’s seven existing dcs on average serviced approximately 1070 stores with an average distance per delivery of approximately 235 miles

the company has made significant investments in technology in recent years in 2004 a merchandising data warehouse was added the rollout of creditdebit andor electronic benefit transfer “ebt” capabilities was completed and an automatic inventory replenishment system was installed in all stores in addition a new stock ledger implemented in 2005 and sales flash system were completed also for the first time store district managers were equipped with personal computers to enable them to access daily merchandising information in 2003 the company implemented an improved warehouse management system a dc appointment scheduling system an inventory reconciliation system allocation system improvements shortage analysis reporting improvements to automated dc replenishment systems and began the rollout of creditdebit and ebt to the stores technology initiatives in 2002 included the establishment of perpetual inventories in all stores a new order processing system new loss prevention software systems for a new import deconsolidation function the establishment of a businessto

business website for supply chain efficiencies and systems to enable automated store replenishment 

merchandising initiatives  the company’s merchandising initiatives are designed to promote samestore sales increases the company continually evaluates the performance of its merchandise mix and makes adjustments when appropriate in recent years the company has increased its emphasis on the highly consumable category by adding items in the food paper household chemicals and health and beauty aids categories also in recent years the company began offering perishable products which includes a selection of dairy products luncheon meats frozen foods and ice cream the expansion of perishable product offerings into additional stores was a significant 2004 initiative increasing from 2445 stores at the end of 2003 to 6755 stores at the end of 2004 

prior to 2000 the company’s strategy was generally to avoid marking items down from the everyday low retail price with the exception of damaged product which was typically marked down to zero and disposed of in 2000 and in subsequent years in addition to continuing its practice of marking down damaged product the company selectively marked down slower moving and discontinued items in the fourth quarter of 2003 and principally at the conclusion of the holiday selling season the company took endofseason markdowns materially in excess of what it had taken in prior years to help dispose of certain holidayrelated items that had not sold in sufficient quantities in the past the company would have carried that inventory forward and would have attempted to adjust future inventory purchases to account for the carryover product in 2004 the company continued this practice of emphasizing the inseason sale of seasonal merchandise by taking progressive endofseason markdowns the company intends to continue this ongoing yearround strategy management expects to establish the appropriate size of such markdowns by means of an ongoing cost benefit analysis that considers factors such as the potential corresponding increase in sales and a potential reduction in shrink and inventory handling and carrying costs

the dollar store category differentiates itself from other forms of retailing by offering consistently low prices in a convenient smallstore format the company believes that its prices are competitive because of its low cost operating structure and the relatively limited assortment of products offered labor and marketing expenses are minimized by fewer price points relying on simple merchandise presentation and the limited use of circulars the company attempts to locate primarily in secondtier locations either in small towns or in the neighborhoods of more densely populated areas where occupancy expenses are relatively low the company believes that its limited assortment of products allows it to focus its purchasing efforts on fewer skus than other retailers which helps keep its cost of goods relatively low

on january 12 2004 the court certified an optin class of plaintiffs consisting of all persons employed by the company as store managers at any time since march 14 1999 who regularly worked more than 50 hours per week and either 1 customarily supervised less than two employees at one time 2 lacked authority to hire or discharge employees without supervisor approval or 3 sometimes worked in nonmanagerial positions at stores other than the one he or she managed the company’s attempt to appeal this decision on a discretionary basis to the 11 th circuit court of appeals was denied

·

earnings per share “eps” growth current year eps minus prior year eps divided by prior year eps equals percentage change which is an indicator of the increased returns generated for the company’s shareholders 

·

total net sales growth current year total net sales minus prior year total net sales divided by prior year total net sales equals percentage change which indicates among other things the success of the company’s selection of new store locations and merchandising strategies 

·

operating margin rate operating profit divided by net sales which is an indicator of the company’s success in leveraging its fixed costs and managing its variable costs 

·

return on invested capital numerator – net income plus interest expense net of tax plus rent expense net of tax denominator – average longterm debt plus average shareholders’ equity both measured at the end of the latest five fiscal quarters plus average rent expense multiplied by eight average rent expense is computed using a twoyear period although this measure is a not computed using generally accepted 

accounting principles “gaap” the company believes it is useful because return on invested capital measures the efficiency of the company’s capital deployed in its operations 

·

free cash flow the sum of net cash flows from operating activities net cash flows from investing activities and net cash flows from financing activities excluding share repurchases and changes in debt other than required payments although this measure is a nongaap measure the company believes it is useful as an indicator of the cash flow generating capacity of the company’s operations it is also a useful metric to analyze in conjunction with net income to determine whether there is any significant noncash component to the company’s net income 

·

inventory turns cost of goods sold for the year divided by average inventory balances at cost measured at the end of the latest five fiscal quarters which is an indicator of how well the company is managing the largest asset on its balance sheet 

·

return on average assets net income for the year divided by average total assets measured at the end of the latest five fiscal quarters which is an overall indicator of the company’s effectiveness in deploying its resources 

the company computes the above metrics using both gaap and certain nongaap information as discussed further below under “results of operations” the company generally excludes items relating to the restatement of the company’s 19982000 financial results the “2001 restatement” to more effectively evaluate the company’s performance on a comparable and ongoing basis

the company also pays particular attention to its samestore sales growth which is a subcategory of its total sales growth and its shrink performance which is a subcategory of its operating margin rate in 2004 and 2003 the company experienced samestore sales growth of 32 and 40 respectively in 2004 and 2003 the company’s shrink expressed in retail dollars as a percentage of sales was 305 for each year

results of operations 

the following discussion of the company’s financial performance is based on the consolidated financial statements set forth herein the company has included in this document certain financial information not derived in accordance with gaap such as selling general and administrative “sga” expenses net income and diluted earnings per share that exclude the impact of items relating to the 2001 restatement the company believes that this information is useful to investors as it indicates more clearly the company’s comparative yeartoyear operating results this information should not be considered a substitute for any measures derived in accordance with gaap management may use this information to better understand the company’s underlying operating results reconciliations of these nongaap measures to the most comparable measure calculated in accordance with gaap are contained in the table below

the company has restated its consolidated financial statements as discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for all previous years presented the “restatement” the following discussion of the company’s results of operations incorporates the effects of this restatement

for fiscal years 2001 and 2000 the restatement reduced previously reported net income by approximately 36 million and 37 million respectively or approximately 01 per diluted share in each year retained earnings at the beginning of 2000 have been reduced by approximately 107 million to reflect the aftertax impacts of earlier periods

the following table contains results of operations data for the 2004 2003 and 2002 fiscal years the dollar and percentage variances among those years and reconciliations of any nongaap measures to the most comparable measure calculated in accordance with gaap

net sales  increases in net sales resulted primarily from opening additional stores including 620 net new stores in 2004 and a samestore sales increase of 32 for 2004 compared to 2003 samestore sales calculations for a given period include only those stores that were open both at the end of that period and at the beginning of the preceding fiscal year the increase in samestore sales accounted for 2040 million of the increase in sales while stores opened since the beginning of 2003 were the primary contributors to the remaining 5850 million sales increase during 2004 the increase in samestore sales is primarily attributable to an increase in the number of customer transactions 

the company monitors its sales internally by the four major categories noted in the table above the company’s merchandising mix in recent years has shifted to fasterturning consumable products versus home products and clothing this has been driven by customer wants and needs in the marketplace as a result over the past three years the highly consumable category has become a greater percentage of the company’s overall sales mix while the percentages of the home products and basic clothing categories have declined accordingly the company’s sales increase by merchandise category in 2004 compared to 2003 was primarily attributable to the highly consumable category which increased by 6182 million or 147 the company continually reviews its merchandise mix and adjusts it when deemed necessary as a part of its ongoing efforts to improve overall sales and gross profit these ongoing reviews may result in a shift in the company’s merchandising strategy which could increase permanent markdowns in the future 

the company’s sales increase in 2003 compared to 2002 resulted primarily from opening additional stores including 587 net new stores in 2003 and a samestore sales increase of 40 for 2003 compared to 2002 the increase in samestore sales accounted for 2283 million of the increase in sales while stores opened since the beginning of 2003 were the primary contributors to the remaining 5433 million sales increase during 2003 the company’s sales increase by merchandise category in 2003 compared to 2002 was primarily attributable to the seasonal category which increased by 1619 million or 163 and the highly consumable category which increased by 5319 million or 145

gross profit  the gross profit rate increased 17 basis points in 2004 as compared with 2003 although the company’s margin rate is pressured by sales mix shifts to more highly consumable items which typically carry lower gross profit rates the company has been able to more than offset this through increases in gross markups on all merchandise categories more specific factors include the following

·

higher initial markups on merchandise received during 2004 as compared with 2003 approximately 32 basis points of gross margin improvement this improvement was achieved primarily from the positive impact of opportunistic purchasing renegotiating product costs with several key suppliers selective price increases and an increase in various performancebased vendor rebates 

·

higher average markups on the company’s beginning inventory in 2004 as compared to 2003 approximately 20 basis points of gross margin improvement this increased average markup represents the cumulative impact of higher margin purchases over time 

these components of margin which both positively impacted the company’s results were partially offset by

·

an increase in transportation expenses as a percentage of sales approximately 23 basis points of gross margin decline this increase resulted primarily from higher fuel costs in 2004 as compared to 2003 

·

a nonrecurring favorable inventory adjustment in 2003 representing a change in the company’s estimated provision for shrinkage approximately 6 basis points of gross margin decline 

the gross profit rate increased 111 basis points in 2003 as compared with 2002 primarily due to the following

·

higher initial markups on merchandise received during 2003 as compared with 2002 approximately 59 basis points of gross margin improvement this improvement was achieved primarily from increased purchases of higher margin seasonal and home product items a 31 increase in imported purchases which carry higher than average markups and a 72 increase in various performancebased vendor rebates 

·

a reduction in the company’s shrink provision from 352 in 2002 to 305 in 2003 calculated using retail dollars as a percentage of sales approximately 41 basis points of gross margin improvement at cost the company made progress in reducing the shrink at problem stores during 2003 but generally fell short of corporate goals 

·

higher average markups on the company’s beginning inventory in 2003 as compared to 2002 approximately 18 basis points of gross margin improvement this increased average markup represents the cumulative impact of higher margin purchases over time 

·

a reduction in transportation expenses as a percentage of sales approximately 14 basis points of gross margin improvement this reduction resulted primarily from system enhancements and improved process efficiencies in managing outbound freight costs which contributed to an approximate 7 decline in outbound cost per carton delivered in 2003 as compared to 2002 

these components of margin which all positively impacted the company’s results were partially offset by

·

the impact of the company’s lifo valuation adjustments in the fourth quarters of 2003 versus 2002 approximately 16 basis points of gross margin decline in 2002 the company recorded an 89 million lifo adjustment which had the effect of increasing gross margin and primarily resulted from the company’s ability to lower its product costs through effective purchasing methods and the general lack of inflation during the period the company did not benefit from a comparable adjustment in 2003 primarily because the lifo reserves in certain inventory departments had been reduced to nominal amounts or zero in 2002 or prior years 

·

an increase in markdowns of 14 basis points the increase in markdowns was due principally to increased christmasrelated markdowns compared to those the 

company had taken in the past and to a lesser extent markdowns taken to assist with the sale of both discontinued and slower moving apparel items

selling general and administrative “sga” expense  the increase in sga expense as a percentage of sales in 2004 as compared with 2003 was due to a number of factors including but not limited to increases in the following expense categories that were in excess of the 115 percent increase in sales store occupancy costs increased 174 primarily due to rising average monthly rentals associated with the company’s leased store locations an increase in purchased services increased 546 due primarily to fees associated with the increased customer usage of debit cards professional fees increased 1192 primarily due to consulting fees associated with both the company’s 2004 ezstore project and compliance with certain provisions of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and increased costs for inventory services increased 882 due to both an increased number of physical inventories and a higher average cost per physical inventory partially offsetting these increases was a reduction in accruals for employee bonus expenses declined 213 primarily related to higher bonus expense in 2003 related to the company’s financial performance during 2003

the increase in sga expense as a percentage of sales excluding expenses relating to the 2001 restatement primarily professional fees in 2003 as compared with 2002 was due to a number of factors including but not limited to increases in the following expense categories that were in excess of the 126 percentage increase in sales store labor increased 146 primarily due to increases in store trainingrelated costs the cost of workers’ compensation and other insurance programs increased 298 primarily due to an increase in medical inflation costs experienced by the company compared to previous years store occupancy costs increased 160 primarily due to rising average monthly rentals associated with the company’s leased store locations and higher bonus expense increased 344 related to the company’s financial performance during 2003

penalty expense and litigation settlement proceeds  as more fully discussed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements the company accrued 100 million in 2003 with respect to a civil penalty related to its agreement in principle with the securities and exchange commission “sec” staff to settle the matters arising out of the company’s 2001 restatement in 2002 the company recorded 295 million in net litigation settlement proceeds which amount included 297 million in insurance proceeds associated with the settlement of class action and shareholder derivative litigation offset by a 02 million settlement of a shareholder class action optout claim all of which related to the 2001 restatement 

interest expense  the decrease in interest expense in 2004 compared to 2003 is due primarily to capitalized interest of 36 million related to the company’s dc construction and expansion projects in 2004 compared to 02 million in 2003 and a reduction in amortization of debt issuance costs of 22 million due in part to the amendment of the company’s revolving credit facility in june 2004 the decrease in interest expense in 2003 as compared to 2002 is due primarily to debt reduction achieved during 2003 the average daily total debt outstanding over the past three years was as follows 2004  2801 million at an average interest rate of 85 2003  3015 million at an average interest rate of 86 and 2002  5757 million at an average interest rate of 66 the increase in the company’s average interest rate from 2002 to 

2003 is due primarily to the reduction of variable rate debt all of the company’s outstanding indebtedness at january 28 2005 and january 30 2004 was fixed rate debt

income taxes  the effective income tax rates for 2004 2003 and 2002 were 356 373 and 361 respectively the 2004 rate was lower than the 2003 rate primarily due to a net reduction in certain contingent income tax liabilities of approximately 62 million recognized in the second quarter of 2004 when the company adjusted its tax contingency reserve as the result of two state income tax examinations the tax rate in 2003 was negatively impacted by the 100 million penalty expense in 2003 as discussed above which was not deductible for income tax purposes the lower effective tax rate in 2002 was primarily due to the favorable resolution of certain state tax related items during 2002

liquidity and capital resources 

current financial condition  recent developments  during the past three years the company has generated an aggregate of approximately 133 billion in cash flows from operating activities during that period the company has expanded the number of stores it operates by 32 1780 stores and has incurred approximately 566 million in capital expenditures primarily to support this growth also during this threeyear period the company has reduced its longterm debt by approximately 464 million and has expended approximately 239 million for repurchases of its common stock

the company’s inventory balance represented approximately 48 of its total assets as of january 28 2005 the company’s proficiency in managing its inventory balances can have a significant impact on the company’s cash flows from operations during a given fiscal year for example in 2004 changes in inventory balances represented a 2194 million use of cash as explained in more detail below while in 2002 changes in inventory balances represented an 80 million source of cash inventory turns increased from 38 times in 2002 to 40 times in both 2003 and 2004

as described in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements the company is involved in a number of legal actions and claims some of which could potentially result in material cash payments adverse developments in those actions could materially and adversely affect the company’s liquidity the company also has certain income taxrelated contingencies as more fully described below under “critical accounting policies and estimates” estimates of these contingent liabilities are included in the company’s consolidated financial statements however future negative developments could have a material adverse effect on the company’s liquidity see notes 5 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements

on november 30 2004 the board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to 10 million shares of its outstanding common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time subject to market conditions the objective of the share repurchase program is to enhance shareholder value by purchasing shares at a price that produces a return on investment that is greater than the companys cost of capital additionally share repurchases will be undertaken only if such purchases result in an accretive impact on the companys fully diluted earnings per share calculation this authorization expires november 30 

2005 during 2004 the company purchased approximately 05 million shares pursuant to this authorization at a total cost of 109 million

on march 13 2003 the board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to 12 million shares of its outstanding common stock with provisions and objectives similar to the november 30 2004 authorization discussed above this authorization expired march 13 2005 during 2003 the company purchased approximately 15 million shares at a total cost of 297 million during 2004 the company purchased approximately 105 million shares at a total cost of 1984 million as of january 28 2005 approximately 120 million shares had been purchased substantially completing this share repurchase authorization share repurchases in 2004 increased diluted earnings per share by approximately 002

the following table summarizes the company’s significant contractual obligations as of january 28 2005 in thousands

 

the company has a 250 million revolving credit facility the “credit facility” which expires in june 2009 as of january 28 2005 the company had no outstanding borrowings and 87 million of standby letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility the standby letters of credit reduce the borrowing capacity of the credit facility the credit facility contains certain financial covenants all of which the company was in compliance with at january 28 2005 see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the credit facility

the company has 200 million principal amount of 8 58 unsecured notes due june 15 2010 this indebtedness was incurred to assist in funding the company’s growth interest on the notes is payable semiannually on june 15 and december 15 of each year the note holders may elect to have these notes repaid on june 15 2005 at 100 of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest although the holders of these notes have the ability to require the company to repurchase the notes in june 2005 the company has classified this debt as longterm due to its intent and ability in the event it were required to repurchase any portion of the notes to refinance this indebtedness on a longterm basis including through borrowings under the credit facility the company may seek from time to time to retire the notes through cash purchases on the open market in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise such repurchases if any will depend on prevailing market conditions the company’s liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors the amounts involved may be material

significant terms of the company’s outstanding debt obligations could have an effect on the company’s ability to incur additional debt financing the credit facility contains financial covenants which include limits on certain debt to cash flow ratios a fixed charge coverage test and minimum allowable consolidated net worth the credit facility also places certain specified limitations on secured and unsecured debt the company’s outstanding notes discussed above place certain specified limitations on secured debt and place certain limitations on the company’s ability to execute saleleaseback transactions the company has generated significant cash flows from its operations during recent years the company had peak borrowings under the credit facility of 731 million during 2004 all of which were repaid prior to january 28 2005 and had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility at any time during 2003 therefore the company does not believe that any existing limitations on its ability to incur additional indebtedness will have a material impact on its liquidity notes 6 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements contain additional disclosures related to the company’s debt and financing obligations

at january 28 2005 and january 30 2004 the company had commercial letter of credit facilities totaling 2150 million and 2180 million respectively of which 988 million and 1117 million respectively were outstanding for the funding of imported merchandise purchases

the company believes that its existing cash and shortterm investments balances totaling 2758 million at january 28 2005 cash flows from operations 3897 million generated in 2004 the credit facility 2413 million available at january 28 2005 and its anticipated ongoing access to the capital markets if necessary will provide sufficient financing to meet the company’s currently foreseeable liquidity and capital resource needs

cash flows provided by operating activities  cash flows from operating activities for 2004 compared to 2003 declined by 1240 million the most significant component of the change in cash flows from operating activities was an increase in inventory levels in 2004 total merchandise inventories at the end of 2004 were 138 billion compared to 116 billion at the end of 2003 a 19 percent increase or a 9 percent increase on a per store basis with the remainder primarily attributable to growth in the number of stores the largest portion of the increase in inventories resulted from the company’s focus on improving instock levels of core merchandise at the stores new initiatives including the expansion of the perishable food program and the addition of certain core apparel items magazines and hispanic food items also contributed to the inventory increase in addition due to an early easter in 2005 the company received more seasonal merchandise for spring 2005 before the end of fiscal 2004 in 2005 the company plans to focus on lowering its per store inventory levels cash flows in 2004 increased by 453 million over 2003 related to changes in income taxes payable primarily due to a large payment of federal income taxes for 2002 that was made in 2003 cash flows in the 2004 period were positively impacted by an increase in net income of 452 million driven by improved operating results as more fully discussed above under “results of operations”

cash flows from operations increased by 914 million for 2003 compared to 2002 in 2002 the company paid 1620 million in settlement of the class action lawsuit relating to the 2001 restatement as discussed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements which did not recur in 2003 partially offsetting this cash outflow were 2002 tax benefits totaling 

approximately 1393 million of which approximately 1210 million either directly or indirectly related to the company’s 2001 restatement and subsequent litigation settlement the timing of these tax benefits was a significant component of the reduction of cash flows from deferred 626 million and current 779 million income taxes in 2003 compared to 2002 an increase in accrued liabilities resulted in a 453 million increase in 2003 cash flows compared to 2002 due in part to the accrued sec penalty and increased 2003 bonuses described above increased deferred compensation liabilities and increases in certain tax reserves contributing to the increase in cash flows provided by operating activities in 2003 was an increase in net income of 367 million driven by the improved operating results discussed above see “results of operations”

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if

·

it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and 

·

changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the company’s board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosures presented below relating to them

in addition to the estimates presented below there are other items within the company’s financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed critical as defined above the company believes these estimates are reasonable and appropriate however if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used the resulting changes could have a material effect on the financial statements taken as a whole

merchandise inventories merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined using the retail lastin firstout “lifo” method under the company’s retail inventory method “rim” the calculation of gross profit and the resulting valuation of inventories at cost are computed by applying a calculated costtoretail inventory ratio to the retail value of sales the rim is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality also it is recognized that the use of the rim will result in valuing inventories at the lower of cost or market if markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories

inherent in the rim calculation are certain significant management judgments and estimates including among others initial markups markdowns and shrinkage which significantly impact the gross profit calculation as well as the ending inventory valuation at cost these significant estimates coupled with the fact that the rim is an averaging process can under certain circumstances produce distorted cost figures factors that can lead to distortion in the calculation of the inventory balance include

·

applying the rim to a group of products that is not fairly uniform in terms of its cost and selling price relationship and turnover 

·

applying the rim to transactions over a period of time that include different rates of gross profit such as those relating to seasonal merchandise 

·

inaccurate estimates of inventory shrinkage between the date of the last physical inventory at a store and the financial statement date and 

·

inaccurate estimates of lower of cost or market “lcm” andor lifo reserves 

to reduce the potential of such distortions in the valuation of inventory the company’s rim calculation through the end of 2004 utilized 10 departments in which fairly homogenous classes of merchandise inventories having similar gross margins were grouped in 2005 in order to further refine its rim calculation the company expanded the number of departments it utilizes for its gross margin calculation from 10 to 23 the impact of this change on the company’s future consolidated financial statements is not currently expected to be material to a given fiscal year although a given quarter could be impacted based on the mix of sales in the quarter other factors that reduce potential distortion include the use of historical experience in estimating the shrink provision see discussion below and the utilization of an independent statistician to assist in the lifo sampling process and index formulation also on an ongoing basis the company reviews and evaluates the salability of its inventory and records lcm reserves if necessary

the company calculates its shrink provision based on actual physical inventory results during the fiscal period and an accrual for estimated shrink occurring subsequent to a physical inventory through the end of the fiscal reporting period this accrual is calculated as a percentage of sales and is determined by dividing the booktophysical inventory adjustments recorded during the previous twelve months by the related sales for the same period for each store beginning in 2003 in an effort to improve this estimate the company began applying 

storespecific shrink rates to storespecific sales generated subsequent to a given store’s physical inventory in 2002 the company applied a weightedaverage shrink rate to all company sales generated subsequent to physical inventories to the extent that subsequent physical inventories yield different results than this estimated accrual the company’s effective shrink rate for a given reporting period will include the impact of adjusting the estimated results to the actual results although the company performs physical inventories in all of its stores annually the same stores do not necessarily get counted in the same reporting periods from year to year which could impact comparability in a given reporting period

during 2003 the company implemented an itemlevel perpetual inventory system for financial reporting purposes the new system provided better information regarding the type of inventory that the company owned and improved the company’s ability to estimate its shrink provision as discussed above the utilization of this improved information in the company’s rim calculation resulted in a nonrecurring inventory adjustment of approximately 78 million which favorably impacted gross profit in the third quarter of 2003

property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost the company groups its assets into relatively homogeneous classes and generally provides for depreciation on a straightline basis over the estimated average useful life of each asset class except for leasehold improvements which are amortized over the shorter of the applicable lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset the valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful depreciable lives involves significant judgments and the use of estimates property and equipment are reviewed for impairment periodically and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable

selfinsurance liability the company retains a significant portion of the risk for its workers’ compensation employee health insurance general liability property loss and automobile coverage these costs are significant primarily due to the large employee base and number of stores provisions are made to this insurance liability on an undiscounted basis based on actual claim data and estimates of incurred but not reported claims developed by an independent actuary utilizing historical claim trends if future claim trends deviate from recent historical patterns the company may be required to record additional expenses or expense reductions which could be material to the company’s future financial results

contingent liabilities – income taxes  the company is subject to routine income tax audits that occur periodically in the normal course of business the company estimates its contingent income tax liabilities based on its assessment of probable income taxrelated exposures and the anticipated settlement of those exposures translating into actual future liabilities the contingent liabilities are estimated based on both historical audit experiences with various state and federal taxing authorities and the company’s interpretation of current income taxrelated trends if the company’s income tax contingent liability estimates prove to be inaccurate the resulting adjustments could be material to the company’s future financial results

contingent liabilities  legal matters the company is subject to legal regulatory and other proceedings and claims reserves if any are established for these claims and proceedings based upon the probability and estimability of losses and to fairly present in conjunction with 

the disclosures of these matters in the company’s financial statements and sec filings management’s view of the company’s exposure the company reviews outstanding claims and proceedings with external counsel to assess probability and estimates of loss these assessments are reevaluated each quarter or as new information becomes available to determine whether a reserve should be established or if any existing reserve should be adjusted the actual cost of resolving a claim or proceeding ultimately may be substantially different than the amount of the recorded reserve in addition because it is not permissible under gaap to establish a litigation reserve until the loss is both probable and estimable in some cases there may be insufficient time to establish a reserve prior to the actual incurrence of the loss upon verdict and judgment at trial for example or in the case of a quickly negotiated settlement see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements

effects of inflation

in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 123r “sharebased payment” which will require all companies to measure compensation cost for all sharebased payments including employee stock options at fair value this new standard will be effective for public companies for interim or annual periods beginning after june 15 2005 companies can adopt the new standard in one of two ways i the modified prospective application in which a company would recognize sharebased employee compensation cost from the beginning of the fiscal period in which the recognition provisions are first applied as if the fairvaluebased accounting method had been used to account for all employee awards granted modified or settled after the effective date and to any awards that were not fully vested as of the effective date or ii the modified retrospective application in which a company would recognize employee compensation cost for periods presented prior to the adoption of sfas no 123r in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” pursuant to which an entity would recognize employee compensation cost in the amounts reported in the pro forma disclosures provided in accordance with sfas no 123 the company expects to adopt sfas no 123r during the third quarter of 2005 using the modified prospective application and expects to incur incremental sga expense associated with the adoption of approximately 4 million to 8 million in 2005 see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for disclosure of the pro forma effects of stock option grants as determined using the methodology prescribed under sfas no 123

the company’s business is moderately seasonal with the highest sales occurring during the fourth quarter adverse events during the fourth quarter could therefore affect the company’s financial statements as a whole  the company realizes a significant portion of its net sales and net income during the holiday selling season in anticipation of the holidays the company purchases substantial amounts of seasonal inventory and hires many temporary employees if for any reason the company’s net sales during the holiday selling season were to fall below seasonal norms a seasonal merchandise inventory imbalance could result if such an imbalance were to occur markdowns might be required to minimize this imbalance the company’s profitability and operating results could be adversely affected by unanticipated markdowns 

adverse weather conditions or other disruptions especially during the peak holiday season but also at other times could also adversely affect the company’s net sales and could make it more difficult for the company to obtain sufficient quantities of merchandise from its suppliers

competition in the retail industry could limit the company’s growth opportunities and reduce its profitability the company competes in the discount retail merchandise business which is highly competitive this competitive environment subjects the company to the risk of reduced profitability resulting from reduced margins required to maintain the company’s competitive position the company competes with discount stores and with many other retailers including mass merchandise grocery drug convenience variety and other specialty stores some of the nation’s largest retail companies operate stores in areas where the company operates the company’s direct competitors in the dollar store retail category include family dollar dollar tree fred’s and various local independent operators competitors from other retail categories include cvs rite aid walgreens eckerd walmart and kmart the discount retail merchandise business is subject to excess capacity and some of the company’s competitors are much larger and have substantially greater resources than the company the competition for customers has intensified in recent years as larger competitors such as walmart have moved into the company’s geographic markets the company remains vulnerable to the marketing power and high level of consumer recognition of these major national discount chains and to the risk that these chains or others could venture into the “dollar store” industry in a significant way generally the company expects an increase in competition

the company’s financial performance is sensitive to changes in overall economic conditions that may impact consumer spending  a general slowdown in the united states economy may adversely affect the spending of the company’s consumers which would likely result in lower net sales than expected on a quarterly or annual basis future economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as employment levels business conditions fuel and energy costs interest rates and tax rates could also adversely affect the company’s business by reducing consumer spending or causing consumers to shift their spending to other products

existing military efforts and the possibility of war acts of terrorism and rising fuel costs could adversely impact the company existing us military efforts as well as the involvement of the united states in other military engagements or a significant act of terrorism on us soil or elsewhere could have an adverse impact on the company by among other things disrupting its information or distribution systems causing dramatic increases in fuel prices thereby increasing the costs of doing business or impeding the flow of imports or domestic products to the company

the company’s business is dependent on its ability to obtain attractive pricing and other terms from its vendors and to timely receive inventory  the company believes that it has generally good relations with its vendors and that it is generally able to obtain attractive pricing and other terms from vendors if the company fails to maintain good relations with its vendors it may not be able to obtain attractive pricing with the consequence that its net sales or profit margins would be reduced the company may also face difficulty in obtaining needed inventory from its vendors because of interruptions in production or for other reasons which would adversely affect the company’s business also prolonged or repeated price increases of certain raw materials could affect our vendors’ product costs and ultimately the company’s profitability

the efficient operation of the company’s business is heavily dependent on its information systems  the company depends on a variety of information technology systems for the efficient functioning of its business the company relies on certain software vendors to maintain and periodically upgrade many of these systems so that they can continue to support the company’s business the software programs supporting many of the company’s systems were licensed to the company by independent software developers the inability of these developers or the company to continue to maintain and upgrade these information systems and software programs would disrupt or reduce the efficiency of the company’s operations if it were unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner in addition costs and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology or with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems could also disrupt or reduce the efficiency of the company’s operations

the company is subject to interest rate risk  the company is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on its financing investing and cash management activities the company may utilize its credit facility to fund working capital requirements which is comprised of variable rate debt see “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk”

the company is dependent upon the smooth functioning of its distribution network and upon the capacity of its dcs  the company relies upon the ability to replenish depleted inventory through deliveries to its dcs from vendors and from the dcs to its stores by various means of transportation including shipments by air sea and truck on the roads and highways of the united states labor shortages in the trucking industry could negatively impact transportation costs in addition longterm disruptions to the national and international transportation infrastructure that lead to delays or interruptions of service would adversely affect the company’s business moreover to facilitate its expected growth the company will need additional dcs in the coming years if the company were unable to locate sites for the new dcs or were unable to achieve functionality of the new dcs in the time frame expected the company’s ability to achieve the expected growth could be inhibited

construction and expansion projects relating to the company’s dcs entail risks which could cause delays and cost overruns such as shortages of materials shortages of skilled labor or work stoppages unforeseen construction scheduling engineering environmental or geological problems weather interference fires or other casualty losses and unanticipated cost increases the completion dates and anticipated costs of these projects could differ significantly from initial expectations for constructionrelated or other reasons the company cannot guarantee that any project will be completed on time or within established budgets 

the company’s success depends to a significant extent upon the abilities of its senior management team and the performance of its employees the loss of services of key members of the company’s senior management team or of certain other key employees could negatively impact the company’s business in addition future performance will depend upon the company’s ability to attract retain and motivate qualified employees to keep pace with its expansion schedule the inability to do so may limit the company’s ability to effectively penetrate new market areas 

if the company cannot open new stores on schedule its growth will be impeded delays in store openings could adversely affect the company’s future operations by slowing new store growth which may in turn reduce its revenue growth the company’s ability to timely open new stores and to expand into additional states will depend in part on the following factors the availability of attractive store locations the ability to negotiate favorable lease terms the ability to hire and train new personnel especially store managers the ability to identify customer demand in different geographic areas general economic conditions and the availability of sufficient funds for expansion many of these factors are beyond the company’s control

the inability to execute operating initiatives could impact the company’s operating results the company is undertaking a significant number of operating initiatives in 2005 that have the potential to be disruptive in the short term if they are not implemented effectively ineffective implementation or execution of some or all of these initiatives could negatively impact the company’s operating results 

the company’s cost of doing business could increase as a result of changes in federal state or local regulations  unanticipated changes in the federal or state minimum wage or living wage requirements or changes in other wage or workplace regulations could adversely impact the company’s ability to meet financial targets in addition changes in these requirements or in federal state or local regulations governing the sale of the company’s products particularly 

“overthecounter” medications or health products would increase the company’s cost of doing business and with respect to regulations governing the sale of products could adversely and materially impact the company’s sales results

rising insurance costs and loss experience could negatively impact profitability  the costs of insurance workers’ compensation insurance general liability insurance health insurance property insurance and directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and loss experience have risen in recent years if such increases continue they could have a negative impact on the company’s profitability

the company’s reputation and financial condition could be affected by the sec investigation as previously disclosed in the company’s periodic reports filed with the sec the company restated its audited financial statements for fiscal years 1999 and 1998 and certain unaudited financial information for fiscal year 2000 by means of its form 10k for the fiscal year ended february 2 2001 which was filed on january 14 2002 the “2001 restatement”

the sec has been conducting an investigation into the circumstances giving rise to the 2001 restatement and on january 8 2004 the company received notice that the sec staff was considering recommending that the sec bring a civil injunctive action against the company for alleged violations of the federal securities laws in connection with circumstances relating to the 2001 restatement the company subsequently reached an agreement in principle with the sec staff to settle the matter under the terms of the agreement in principle the company will consent without admitting or denying the allegations in a complaint to be filed by the sec to the entry of a permanent civil injunction against future violations of the antifraud books and records reporting and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws and related sec rules and will pay a 10 million nondeductible civil penalty the agreement with the sec staff is subject to final approval by the court in which the sec’s complaint is filed the company accrued 10 million with respect to the penalty in its financial statements for the year ended january 30 2004 and this accrual remains outstanding as of january 28 2005 the company can give no assurances that the court will approve this agreement if the agreement is not approved the company could be subject to different or additional penalties both monetary and nonmonetary which could adversely affect the company’s financial statements as a whole the publicity surrounding the sec investigation and settlement also could affect the company’s reputation and have an adverse impact on its financial statements as a whole

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

financial risk management 

the company is exposed to market risk primarily from adverse changes in interest rates to minimize such risk the company may periodically use financial instruments including derivatives as a matter of policy the company does not buy or sell financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes and all financial instrument transactions must be authorized and executed pursuant to approval by the board of directors all financial instrument positions taken by the company are used to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure because of high correlation between the financial instrument and the underlying exposure being hedged fluctuations in the value of the financial instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying economic exposure the financial instruments used by the company are straightforward instruments with liquid markets

the company has cash flow exposure relating to variable interest rates associated with its revolving line of credit and may periodically seek to manage this risk through the use of interest rate derivatives the primary interest rate exposure on variable rate obligations is based on the london interbank offered rate “libor” 

at january 28 2005 and january 30 2004 the fair value of the company’s debt excluding capital lease obligations was approximately 2787 million and 2654 million respectively net of the fair value of a note receivable on the south boston virginia dc of approximately 500 million and 489 million respectively as further discussed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements based upon the estimated market value of the debt at those dates such fair value exceeded the carrying values of the debt at january 28 2005 and january 30 2004 by approximately 355 million and 217 million respectively

at february 1 2002 the company was party to an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of 100 million the company designated this agreement as a hedge of its floating rate commitments relating to a portion of certain synthetic lease agreements that existed at that time under the terms of the agreement the company paid a fixed rate of 560 and received a floating rate libor on the 100 million notional amount through september 1 2002 the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement was 26 million at february 1 2002 the counterparty to the company’s interest rate swap agreement was a major financial institution the interest rate swap agreement expired on september 1 2002 as of january 28 2005 the company was not party to any interest rate derivatives 

in 2002 as required by sfas no 133 the company recorded the fair value of the interest rate swap in the balance sheet with the offsetting effective portion of the change in fair value recorded in other comprehensive loss a separate component of shareholders’ equity in the consolidated financial statements amounts recorded in other comprehensive loss were reclassified into earnings as an adjustment to interest expense in the same period during which the hedged synthetic lease agreements affected earnings 

based upon the company’s variable rate borrowing levels a 1 adverse change in interest rates would have resulted in a pretax reduction of earnings and cash flows of less than 01 million and approximately 17 million in 2004 and 2002 respectively including the effects of interest rate swaps in 2002 in 2003 the company had no outstanding variable rate borrowings based upon the company’s outstanding indebtedness at january 28 2005 and january 30 2004 a 1 reduction in interest rates would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of the company’s fixed rate debt of approximately 105 million and 148 million respectively

controls and procedures 

a 

disclosure controls and procedures the company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information relating to the company and its consolidated subsidiaries required to be disclosed in the company’s periodic filings under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported in a timely manner in accordance with the requirements of the exchange act and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management including the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure the company carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of management including the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined in exchange act rule 13a15e as discussed more fully in management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting set out below management identified a material weakness relating to the company’s internal controls that arose from the company’s inappropriate interpretation of gaap relating to accounting for leases and leasehold improvements accordingly the company determined to restate certain of its previously issued financial statements to reflect the company’s correction of those accounting practices the effects of this restatement are not material to previously reported results and have no impact on the company’s current or future cash flows based solely on the foregoing facts and circumstances the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer each concluded that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of january 28 2005

b 

management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting management of the company is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 the companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance that the controls and procedures will meet their objectives regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation

management assessed the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of january 28 2005 in making this assessment management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control – integrated framework the assessment identified a material weakness in the companys internal control that arose from the company’s inappropriate interpretation of gaap relating to accounting for leases and leasehold improvements as described more fully below a 

material weakness is a control deficiency or combination of control deficiencies that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected 

as more fully discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements the company restated its previously issued financial statements as a result of correcting its accounting practices relating to the amortization of certain leasehold improvements and the recognition of rent expense the restatement was technically required even though the adjustments for each individual year are not material to that year’s previously reported results and have no impact on the company’s current or future cash flows near the end of its fiscal year after reviewing numerous press releases issued by other companies and other public comments pertaining to these topics and after discussing the matter with its external auditors the company undertook a new review of its operating lease accounting and leasehold amortization practices this review together with the views on the matters expressed by the sec in a february 7 2005 letter to the chairman of the aicpa center for public company audit firms led to the company’s conclusion that its historical accounting practices in these areas were not in accordance with gaap these historical practices were specifically reviewed on several occasions in the past by the company’s management external auditors and audit committee of the board of directors in addition the company’s practices were similar to those used by many other retail and restaurant companies although the company corrected these errors prior to the filing of its form 10k for the 2004 fiscal year thus remediating its only material weakness they were not effectively remediated prior to january 28 2005 accordingly the company concluded that it had a material weakness namely the incorrect interpretation and application of gaap relating to the two leaserelated matters discussed above

based on managements assessment management concluded that as of january 28 2005 due solely to the material weakness related to the accounting for leases and leasehold improvements the companys internal control over financial reporting was not effective

managements assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of january 28 2005 has been audited by ernst  young llp the independent registered public accounting firm who also audited the companys consolidated financial statements ernst  youngs attestation report on managements assessment of the companys internal control over financial reporting is contained below

goodlettsville tennessee

we have audited managements assessment included in the accompanying managements annual report on internal control over financial reporting that dollar general corporation and subsidiaries did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of january 28 2005 because of the effect of a material weakness in the company’s internal control that arose from the company’s incorrect interpretation and application of generally accepted accounting principles relating to accounting for leases and leasehold improvements based on criteria established in internal control – integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the coso criteria dollar general corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting evaluating management’s assessment testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate

a material weakness is a control deficiency or combination of control deficiencies that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected the following material weakness has been identified and included in management’s assessment subsequent to january 28 2005 management concluded that its historical accounting practices relating to operating leases and leasehold amortization were not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles due to ineffective controls over the interpretation and application of generally accepted accounting principles management also concluded that such incorrect interpretation and application of generally accepted accounting principles constituted a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting as of january 28 2005 as a result of this material weakness in internal control management concluded that rental expense and leasehold amortization expense as well as the related balance sheet accounts were understated and that previously issued financial statements should be restated see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for a full discussion of the effects of these changes to the companys consolidated financial statements this material weakness was considered in determining the nature timing and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2004 consolidated financial statements and this report does not affect our report dated april 5 2005 on those consolidated financial statements

in our opinion managements assessment that dollar general corporation and subsidiaries did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of january 28 2005 is fairly stated in all material respects based on the coso control criteria also in our opinion because of the effect of the material weakness described above on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria dollar general corporation and subsidiaries have not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of january 28 2005 based on the coso control criteria

we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on management’s statements included in the fourth paragraph of the accompanying managements annual report on internal control over financial reporting

growth strategy 

the company has experienced a rapid rate of expansion in recent years increasing its number of stores from 3687 as of january 29 1999 to 6817 as of february 27 2004 in addition to growth from new store openings the company recorded samestore sales increases of 40 and 57 in 2003 and 2002 respectively samestore sales increases are calculated based on the comparable calendar weeks in the prior year samestore sales calculations for a given period include only those stores that were open both at the end of that period and at the beginning of the preceding fiscal year management will continue to seek to grow the company’s business the company believes this growth will come from a combination of new store openings infrastructure investments and merchandising initiatives

new store growth  management believes that the company’s convenient smallstore format is adaptable to small towns and neighborhoods throughout the country the majority of the company’s stores are located in these small towns defined by the company as communities with populations of 20000 or less in 2003 approximately 50 of the company’s new stores were opened in small towns while the other 50 were opened in more densely populated areas the company expects a similar mix of new store openings between small towns and more densely populated areas in 2004 new store openings in 2004 will include the company’s existing market area as well as three additional states identified below where management believes the company has the potential to expand its store base opening stores in its existing market area allows the company to take advantage of brand awareness and to maximize its operating efficiencies

in 2004 the company will expand its operating area to include wisconsin arizona and new mexico which management believes are competitively underserved and offer the potential for additional growth for the company the company did not expand to additional states in 2003 and 2002 in 2001 the company opened stores in two additional states new york and new jersey as of february 27 2004 the company had 160 stores in new york and 24 stores in new jersey the company expects to continue to explore the potential for expansion into additional geographic markets as opportunities present themselves 

in 2003 2002 and 2001 the company opened 673 622 and 602 new stores and remodeled or relocated 76 73 and 78 stores respectively the company currently expects to open approximately 675 new dollar general stores and 20 new dollar general market stores and close 60 to 80 stores in 2004

infrastructure investments  in recent years the company has made significant investments in its distribution network and management information systems in august 2000 the company opened a 10 million squarefoot distribution center “dc” in alachua florida and in april 2001 the company opened a 12 million squarefoot dc in zanesville ohio these significant investments in the company’s distribution network were the result of the company’s strategy to reduce transportation expenses and effectively support the company’s growth in november 2003 and january 2004 the company announced its plans to expand its dcs in south boston virginia and ardmore oklahoma respectively in addition both of these dcs are being converted from single to dual sortation systems which will give them the ability to serve more stores in addition the company has selected union county south carolina as the site of its eighth dc which is expected to be fully operational in mid2005 as of february 27 2004 each of the company’s seven existing dcs on average serviced approximately 974 stores with an average distance per delivery of approximately 225 miles

recent investments in technology are listed below in 2003 these included an improved warehouse management system a dc appointment scheduling system an inventory reconciliation system allocation system improvements creditdebit andor electronic benefit transfer “ebt” capabilities shortage analysis reporting and improvements to automated dc replenishment systems certain of these 2003 projects are still in the implementation phase technology initiatives in 2002 included the establishment of perpetual inventories in all stores a new order processing system new loss prevention software systems for a new import deconsolidation function the establishment of a businesstobusiness website for supply chain efficiencies and systems to enable automated store replenishment during the 20012002 time frame the company implemented a new merchandise planning system designed to assist its merchants with their purchasing and store allocation decisions satellite technology that improves communications between the stores and the corporate office and provides faster check authorization for the company’s customers and new ibm registers that capture sales inventory and payroll data

merchandising initiatives  the company’s merchandising initiatives are designed to promote samestore sales increases in recent years the company has increased its emphasis on the highly consumable category by adding items in the food paper household chemicals and health and beauty aids categories in 2001 the company began offering perishable products this perishable program which includes a selection of dairy products luncheon meats frozen foods and ice cream was expanded from 411 stores at the end of 2001 to 1367 stores at the end of 2002 and 2445 stores at the end of 2003 the company will continue to evaluate the performance of its merchandise mix and make adjustments where appropriate

prior to 2000 the company’s strategy was generally to avoid marking items down from its everyday low retail price with the exception of damaged product which was typically marked down to zero and disposed of in 2000 and in subsequent years in addition to continuing its practice of marking down damaged product the company also selectively marked down slower moving and discontinued items in the fourth quarter of 2003 and principally at the conclusion of the christmas selling season the company took end of season markdowns materially in excess of what it has taken in prior years to help sell through christmasrelated items that had not sold in sufficient quantities in the past the company would have carried that inventory forward and would have attempted to adjust future inventory purchases to account for the carryover product in 2004 and beyond the company intends to continue this practice of emphasizing the inseason sale of seasonal merchandise by taking progressive endofseason markdowns this will be a yearround strategy that will not be limited to the christmas selling season management expects to establish the appropriate size of such markdowns by means of an ongoing cost benefit analysis that considers factors such as the potential corresponding increase in sales and a potential reduction in shrink and inventory handling and carrying costs 

merchandise 

dollar general stores offer a focused assortment of quality consumable basic merchandise in a number of core categories the company separates its merchandise into the following four categories for internal reporting purposes highly consumable seasonal home products and basic clothing

the percentage of total sales of each of the four categories tracked by the company for the preceding three years is as follows

 of the four categories the seasonal category typically records the highest gross profit rate and the highly consumable category typically records the lowest gross profit rate 

the company purchases its merchandise from a wide variety of suppliers approximately 11 of the company’s purchases in 2003 were made from procter and gamble no other supplier accounted for more than 4 of the company’s purchases in 2003 approximately 15 of the company’s retail receipts in 2003 were directly imported by the company

the company is engaged in a highly competitive business with respect to price store location merchandise quality assortment and presentation instock consistency and customer service the company competes with discount stores and with many other retailers including mass merchandise grocery drug convenience variety and other specialty stores some of the nation’s largest retail companies operate stores in areas where the company operates the company’s direct competitors in the dollar store retail category include family dollar dollar tree fred’s and various local independent operators competitors from other retail categories include cvs rite aid walgreens eckerd walmart and kmart some of the company’s competitors from outside the dollar store segment are better capitalized than the company

the dollar store category differentiates itself from other forms of retailing by offering consistently low prices in a convenient smallstore format the company’s prices are competitive because of its low cost operating structure and the relatively limited assortment of products offered labor and marketing expenses are minimized by the limited use of circulars fewer price points and relying on simple merchandise presentation the company attempts to locate primarily in second tier locations either in small towns or in the neighborhoods of more densely populated areas where occupancy expenses are relatively low the company believes that its limited assortment of products allows it to focus its purchasing efforts on fewer skus than other retailers which helps keep its cost of goods relatively low

legal proceedings 

restatementrelated proceedings 

as previously disclosed in the company’s periodic reports filed with the securities and exchange commission the “sec” the company restated its audited financial statements for fiscal years 1999 and 1998 and certain unaudited financial information for fiscal year 2000 by means of its form 10k for the fiscal year ended february 2 2001 which was filed on january 14 2002 

the sec has been conducting an investigation into the circumstances giving rise to the restatement and on january 8 2004 the company received notice that the sec staff was considering recommending that the sec bring a civil injunctive action against the company for alleged violations of the federal securities laws in connection with circumstances relating to the restatement the company subsequently has reached an agreement in principle with the sec staff to settle the matter under the terms of the agreement in principle the company will consent without admitting or denying the allegations in a complaint to be filed by the sec to the entry of a permanent civil injunction against future violations of the antifraud books and records reporting and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws and related sec rules and will pay a 10 million nondeductible civil penalty the company is not entitled to seek reimbursement from its insurers with regard to this settlement

the agreement with the sec staff is subject to final approval by the sec and the court in which the sec’s complaint is filed the company has accrued 10 million with respect to the penalty in its financial statements for the year ended january 30 2004 the company can give no assurances that the sec or the court will approve this agreement if the agreement is not approved the company could be subject to different or additional penalties both monetary and nonmonetary which could adversely affect the company’s financial statements as a whole 

in addition as previously discussed in the company’s periodic reports filed with the sec the company settled in the second quarter of 2002 the lead shareholder derivative action relating to the restatement that had been filed in tennessee state court all other pending state and federal derivative cases were subsequently dismissed during the third quarter of fiscal 2002 the settlement of the shareholder derivative lawsuits resulted in a net payment to the company after attorney’s fees payable to the plaintiffs’ counsel of approximately 252 million which was recorded as income during 2002 the company also settled the federal consolidated restatementrelated class action lawsuit in the second quarter of fiscal 2002 the 162 million settlement which was expensed in the fourth quarter of 2000 was paid in the first half of fiscal 2002 the company received from its insurers 45 million in respect of such settlement in 2002 which was recorded as income 

plaintiffs representing fewer than 1 of the shares traded during the class period chose to opt out of the federal class action settlement one such plaintiff chose to pursue recovery against the company individually in 2002 the company settled and paid that claim and recognized an expense of 02 million in respect of that agreement 

other litigation 

on march 14 2002 a complaint was filed in the united states district court for the northern district of alabama to commence a collective action against the company on behalf of current and former salaried store managers the complaint alleges that these individuals were entitled to overtime pay and should not have been classified as exempt employees under the fair labor standards act “flsa” plaintiffs seek to recover overtime pay liquidated damages declaratory relief and attorneys’ fees 

in the third quarter of 2003 the court denied the plaintiff’s motion to allow the action to proceed as a nationwide collective action but determined that the action could proceed collectively as to a region that was not then defined however on january 12 2004 the court certified an optin class of plaintiffs consisting of all persons employed by the company as store managers at any time since march 14 1999 who regularly worked more than 50 hours per week and either 1 customarily supervised less than two employees at one time 2 lacked authority to hire or discharge employees without supervisor approval or 3 sometimes worked in nonmanagerial positions at stores other than the one he or she managed the company’s attempt to appeal this decision on a discretionary basis to the 11 th circuit court of appeals has been denied 

this action is still in the discovery phase the company believes that its store managers are and have been properly classified as exempt employees under the flsa and that the action is not appropriate for collective action treatment the company intends to vigorously defend the action however no assurances can be given that the company will be successful in defending this action on the merits or otherwise and if not the resolution could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial statements as a whole

the company is involved in other legal actions and claims arising in the ordinary course of business the company currently believes that such litigation and claims both individually and in the aggregate will be resolved without a material effect on the company’s financial statements as a whole however litigation involves an element of uncertainty future developments could cause these actions or claims to have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial statements as a whole

the company measures itself against seven key financial metrics that it believes provide a wellbalanced perspective regarding its overall financial health those metrics are as follows together with how they are computed

 earnings per share “eps” growth current year eps minus prior year eps divided by prior year eps equals percentage change which is an indicator of the increased returns generated for the company’s shareholders

 total net sales growth current year total net sales minus prior year total net sales divided by prior year total net sales equals percentage change which indicates among other things the success of the company’s selection of new store locations and merchandising strategies

 operating margin rate operating profit divided by net sales which is an indicator of the company’s success in leveraging its fixed costs and managing its variable costs

 return on invested capital numerator – net income plus interest expense net of tax plus rent expense net of tax denominator – average longterm debt plus average shareholders’ equity both measured at the end of the latest five fiscal quarters plus average rent expense multiplied by eight average rent expense is computed using a twoyear period although this measure is a nongaap measure the company believes it is useful because return on invested capital measures the efficiency of the company’s capital deployed in its operations

 free cash flow the sum of net cash flows from operating activities net cash flows from investing activities and net cash flows from financing activities excluding share repurchases and changes in debt other than required payments although this measure is a nongaap measure the company believes it is useful as an indicator of the cash flow generating capacity of the company’s operations it is also a useful metric to analyze in conjunction with net income to determine whether there is any significant noncash component to the company’s net income

 inventory turns cost of goods sold for the year divided by average inventory balances at cost measured at the end of the latest five fiscal quarters which is an indicator of how well the company is managing the largest asset on its balance sheet

 return on average assets net income for the year divided by average total assets measured at the end of the latest five fiscal quarters an overall indicator of the company’s effectiveness in deploying its resources 

the company computes the above metrics using both gaap and certain nongaap information as discussed further below under “results of operations” the company generally excludes nonrecurring items such as the restatementrelated items to more effectively evaluate the company’s performance on a comparable and ongoing basis

the company also pays particular attention to its samestore sales growth which is a subcategory of its total sales growth and its shrink performance which is a subcategory of its operating margin rate in 2003 and 2002 the company experienced samestore sales growth of 40 and 57 respectively in 2003 and 2002 the company’s shrink expressed in retail dollars as a percentage of sales was 305 and 352 respectively

results of operations 

the following discussion of the company’s financial performance is based on the consolidated financial statements set forth herein the company has included in this document certain financial information not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” such as selling general and administrative “sga” expenses net income and diluted earnings per share that exclude the impact of restatementrelated items the company believes that this information is useful to investors as it indicates more clearly the company’s comparative yeartoyear operating results this information should not be considered a substitute for any measures derived in accordance with gaap management may use this information to better understand the company’s underlying operating results 

the following table contains results of operations data for the 2003 2002 and 2001 fiscal years and the dollar and percentage variances among those years 

 

net sales  increases in net sales resulted primarily from 587 net new stores and a samestore sales increase of 40 in 2003 compared to 2002 and 573 net new stores and a samestore sales increase of 57 in 2002 compared to 2001 samestore sales calculations for a given period include only those stores that were open both at the end of that period and at the beginning of the preceding fiscal year the company monitors its sales internally by the four major categories noted in the table above the company’s merchandising strategy in recent years has been to place a greater emphasis on fasterturning consumable products and to give less prominence to slowerturning home products and clothing the company believes that this strategy has enabled it to better serve its customers while improving its inventory turns as a result of this strategy over the past three years the highly consumable category has become a greater percentage of the company’s overall sales mix while the percentages of the home products and basic clothing categories have declined 

the company’s samestore sales increase in 2003 over 2002 of 40 or 2283 million was due to a number of factors including but not limited to increased sales of candy and snacks of 64 million which can be partially attributed to the introduction of new items and the placement of many of the items in this category near the front of the store an increase of 31 million in sales of health and beauty aids items due primarily to improved instocks and increased sales of certain overthecounter medications an increase of 30 million in sales of pet supplies primarily due to the success of private label pet foods and the addition during the year of certain pet accessories an increase of approximately 30 million in sales of perishable products primarily due to the increase in the number of stores with coolers and an increase of 24 million in sales of hard goods due primarily to expanded offerings of automotive products

the company’s samestore sales increase in 2002 over 2001 of 57 or 2840 million was due to a number of factors including but not limited to the introduction of approximately 400 new items in the highly consumable category which net of the sales of the items they replaced generated an estimated 85 million increase in samestore sales a strong performance of seasonal merchandise in the first half of 2002 which increased samestore sales by an estimated 42 million during that period a portion of which the company attributes to the introduction of new outdoor items and the staging of warm weather items in its stores earlier than in prior years an increase of approximately 25 million in sales of perishable products primarily due to the increase in the number of stores with coolers and improved ordering practices by its store employees

gross profit  the gross profit rate increased 111 basis points in 2003 as compared with 2002 primarily due to the following

 higher initial markups on merchandise received during 2003 as compared with 2002 approximately 59 basis points of gross margin improvement this improvement was achieved primarily from increased purchases of higher margin seasonal and home product items a 31 increase in imported purchases which carry higher than average markups and a 72 increase in various performancebased vendor rebates

 a reduction in the company’s shrink provision from 352 in 2002 to 305 in 2003 calculated using retail dollars as a percentage of sales approximately 41 basis points of gross margin improvement at cost the company made progress in reducing the shrink at problem stores during 2003 but generally fell short of corporate goals the 305 recorded in the current year exceeds the shrinkage rate recorded in each of the four fiscal years between 1998 and 2001 260 262 280 and 290 respectively and also exceeded the company’s internal plan for 2003 some of the actions taken by the company to combat shrink beginning in 2002 included the development of an asset protection department devoted to reducing shrink losses the installation and utilization of software that identifies unusual cash register transactions increasing the emphasis of shrink in the store bonus plan and the establishment of a multidisciplinary shrink task force that has developed a comprehensive shrink reduction action plan which included the increased use of closed circuit television monitors and burglar alarms a specific high shrink store action plan the creation of various shrink awareness tools and the production of various exception reports to identify high risk stores as mentioned in the executive overview above a continued emphasis on shrink reduction has been identified as a significant operating initiative for 2004

 higher average markups on the company’s beginning inventory in 2003 as compared to 2002 approximately 18 basis points of gross margin improvement this increased average markup represents the cumulative impact of higher margin purchases over time

 a reduction in transportation expenses as a percentage of sales approximately 14 basis points of gross margin improvement this reduction resulted primarily from system enhancements and improved process efficiencies in managing outbound freight costs which contributed to an approximate 7 decline in outbound cost per carton delivered in 2003 as compared to 2002

these components of margin which all positively impacted the company’s results were partially offset by

 the impact of the company’s lifo valuation adjustments in the fourth quarters of 2003 versus 2002 approximately 16 basis points of gross margin decline in 2002 the company recorded an 89 million lifo adjustment which had the effect of increasing gross margin and primarily resulted from the company’s ability to lower its product costs through effective purchasing methods and the general lack of inflation during the period the company did not benefit from a comparable adjustment in 2003 primarily because the lifo reserves in certain inventory departments had been reduced to nominal amounts or zero in 2002 or prior years 

 an increase in markdowns of 14 basis points the increase in markdowns was due principally to increased christmasrelated markdowns compared to those the company had taken in the past and to a lesser extent markdowns taken to assist with the sale of both discontinued and slower moving apparel items

the slight decline in the gross profit rate in 2002 as compared with 2001 was due primarily to an increase in the company’s shrinkage provision from 290 in 2001 to 352 in 2002 calculated using retail dollars as a percentage of sales as discussed above the company has taken several actions to combat shrink and continues to focus on this effort the company improved its initial margin on inventory purchases in all four of its major categories in 2002 as compared against 2001 which partially offset the increase in the shrinkage provision however the continued shift in the company’s sales mix to lower margin highly consumable items noted above limited the year over year increase in the total initial margin rate to 7 basis points the company recorded an 89 million adjustment and a 35 million adjustment in the fourth quarters of 2002 and 2001 respectively pertaining to its lifo valuation which had the effect of increasing gross profit in both years these adjustments were primarily the result of the company’s ability to lower its product costs through effective purchasing methods and the general lack of inflation

distribution and transportation costs decreased by approximately seven and six basis points respectively as a percentage of sales in 2002 as compared to 2001 the reduction in distribution costs as a percentage of sales was due primarily to occupancy and depreciation expenses that grew at a rate less than the sales increase while the reduction in transportation costs as a percentage of sales was due primarily to freight expenses that grew at a rate less than the sales increase occupancy costs represented a decline of approximately five basis points as a percentage of sales in 2002 as compared to 2001 due primarily to reduced rental and real property tax expenses as a percentage of sales depreciation expenses represented a decline of approximately three basis points as a percentage of sales in 2002 as compared to 2001 due primarily to the fact that distribution center depreciation is relatively fixed in comparison with the growth in the company’s sales base factors contributing to the reduction in freight expense as a percentage of sales in 2002 include lower fuel costs during the first half of the year and an effective freight revenue sharing program whereby the company picks up product directly from its vendors as opposed to having it shipped each of which resulted in a decline of approximately four basis points as a percentage of sales in 2002 as compared to 2001

selling general and administrative “sga” expense  the increase in sga expense as a percentage of sales excluding restatementrelated expenses primarily professional fees in 2003 as compared with 2002 was due to a number of factors including but not limited to increases in the following expense categories that were in excess of the 126 percentage increase in sales store labor increased 146 primarily due to increases in store trainingrelated costs the cost of workers’ compensation and other insurance programs increased 298 primarily due to an increase in medical inflation costs experienced by the company compared to previous years store occupancy costs increased 158 primarily due to rising average monthly rentals associated with the company’s leased store locations and higher bonus expense increased 344 related to the company’s financial performance during 2003

the increase in sga expense as a percentage of sales excluding restatementrelated expenses in 2002 as compared with 2001 was due to a number of factors including but not limited to increases in the following expense categories that were in excess of the 146 percentage increase in sales store labor increased 211 primarily due to continued efforts to improve store conditions by both increasing the total number of hours worked in the stores and the average wage of the store employees the cost of workers’ compensation and other insurance programs increased 542 primarily due to higher average medical costs relating to worker’s compensation claims and increased premiums for directors’ and officers’ insurance store occupancy costs increased 186 primarily due to rising common area maintenance costs associated with leased store locations and store repairs and maintenance increased 445 primarily due to increased floor cleaning expenses and higher fixture repair costs

penalty and litigation settlement proceeds  as more fully discussed in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements the company accrued 100 million in 2003 with respect to a civil penalty related to its agreement in principle with the securities and exchange commission “sec” staff to settle the matters arising out of the company’s financial restatement in 2002 the company recorded 295 million in net litigation settlement proceeds which amount included 297 million in insurance proceeds associated with the settlement of the restatementrelated class action and shareholder derivative litigation offset by a 02 million settlement of a shareholder class action optout claim related to the company’s restatement 

interest expense net  the decrease in net interest expense over the period from 2001 to 2003 is due primarily to debt reduction achieved during 2003 and 2002 the average daily total debt outstanding over the past three years was as follows 2003  3015 million at an average interest rate of 86 2002  5757 million at an average interest rate of 66 and 2001  7388 million at an average interest rate of 63 the increase in the company’s average interest rate over the periods above is due primarily to the reduction of variable rate debt all of the company’s outstanding indebtedness at january 30 2004 is fixed rate debt

provision for taxes on income  the effective income tax rates for 2003 2002 and 2001 were 373 361 and 367 respectively the higher tax rate in 2003 is due primarily to the 100 million penalty accrual discussed above which will not be deductible for income tax purposes the lower effective tax rate in 2002 was primarily due to recording higher work opportunity tax credits than in 2001 and the favorable resolution of certain state tax related items during 2002

liquidity and capital resources 

current financial condition  recent developments  during the past three years the company has generated over 12 billion in cash flows from operating activities during that period the company has expanded the number of stores it operates by 34 1700 stores and has incurred 409 million in capital expenditures primarily to support this growth also during this threeyear period the company has reduced its longterm debt by 448 million

the company is involved in a number of legal actions and claims in the ordinary course of business some of which could potentially result in a material cash settlement in addition the company is involved in a collective action pending in the united states district court for the northern district of alabama if the company is not successful in defending that action it could result in a material cash settlement the company also has certain income taxrelated contingencies as more fully described below under “critical accounting policies and estimates” estimates of these contingent liabilities are included in the company’s consolidated financial statements however future negative developments could have a material adverse effect on the company’s liquidity see notes 4 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements

the company’s inventory balance represented over 43 of its total assets as of january 30 2004 the company’s proficiency in managing its inventory balances can have a significant impact on the company’s cash flows from operations during a given fiscal year for example in 2001 changes in inventory balances represented a 1188 million use of cash while in 2002 changes in inventory balances represented an 80 million source of cash inventory turns which increased from 35 times in 2001 to 38 and 40 times in 2002 and 2003 respectively contributed to the improved cash flows 

a substantial portion of the jobs credit programs utilized by the company to reduce its federal income tax liability expired as of december 31 2003 for new employees hired after that date currently there is legislation pending in congress that will reinstate these credits on a retroactive basis while the enactment of this legislation is expected its passage is not certain the company anticipates that its 2004 income tax liability will increase by approximately 26 million if these credit programs are not reenacted on a retroactive basis

on march 13 2003 the board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to 12 million shares of its outstanding common stock purchases may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time subject to market conditions the objective of the share repurchase program is to enhance shareholder value by purchasing shares at a price that produces a return on investment that is greater than the companys cost of capital additionally share repurchases will be undertaken only if such purchases result in an accretive impact on the companys fully diluted earnings per share calculation this authorization expires march 13 2005 during 2003 the company purchased approximately 15 million shares at a total cost of 297 million

the following table summarizes the company’s significant contractual obligations as of january 30 2004 which excludes the effect of imputed interest in thousands

 the company has a 300 million revolving credit facility the “credit facility” which expires in june 2005 during 2004 the company intends to begin discussions with its lenders about amending or replacing the credit facility as of january 30 2004 the company had no outstanding borrowings and 225 million of standby letters of credit under the credit facility the standby letters of credit reduce the borrowing capacity of the credit facility the credit facility contains certain financial covenants all of which the company was in compliance with at january 30 2004 see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the credit facility

the company has 200 million principal amount of 8 58 unsecured notes due june 15 2010 this indebtedness was incurred to assist in funding the company’s growth interest on the notes is payable semiannually on june 15 and december 15 of each year the note holders may elect to have these notes repaid on june 15 2005 at 100 of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest the company may seek from time to time to retire its outstanding notes through cash purchases on the open market privately negotiated transactions or otherwise such repurchases if any will depend on prevailing market conditions the company’s liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors the amounts involved may be material

significant terms of the company’s outstanding debt obligations could have an effect on the company’s ability to incur additional debt financing the credit facility contains financial covenants which include the ratio of debt to ebitdar as defined in the debt agreement fixed charge coverage asset coverage minimum allowable consolidated net worth and maximum allowable capital expenditures the credit facility also places certain specified limitations on secured and unsecured debt the company’s outstanding notes discussed above place certain specified limitations on secured debt and place certain limitations on the company’s ability to execute saleleaseback transactions the company has generated significant cash flows from its operations during recent years and had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility at any time during 2003 therefore the company does not believe that any existing limitations on its ability to incur additional indebtedness will have a material impact on its liquidity notes 5 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements contain additional disclosures related to the company’s debt and financing obligations

at january 30 2004 and january 31 2003 the company had commercial letter of credit facilities totaling 2180 million and 1500 million respectively of which 1117 million and 853 million respectively were outstanding for the funding of imported merchandise purchases

the company believes that its existing cash balances 3983 million at january 30 2004 cash flows from operations 5186 million generated in 2003 the credit facility 2775 million available at january 30 2004 and its anticipated ongoing access to the capital markets if necessary will provide sufficient financing to meet the company’s currently foreseeable liquidity and capital resource needs

cash flows provided by operating activities  cash flows from operations for 2003 compared to 2002 increased by 845 million in 2002 the company paid 1620 million in settlement of the restatementrelated class action lawsuit as discussed in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements which did not recur in 2003 partially offsetting this cash outflow were 2002 tax benefits totaling approximately 1393 million of which approximately 121 million either directly or indirectly related to the company’s financial restatement and subsequent litigation settlement the timing of these tax benefits was a significant component of the reduction of cash flows from deferred 630 million and current 779 million income taxes in 2003 compared to 2002 an increase in accrued liabilities resulted in a 447 million increase in 2003 cash flows compared to 2002 due in part to the accrued sec penalty and increased 2003 bonuses described above increased deferred compensation liabilities and increases in certain tax reserves contributing to the increase in cash flows provided by operating activities in 2003 was an increase in net income of 361 million driven by the improved operating results discussed above see “results of operations”

cash flows from operations for 2002 compared to 2001 increased by 1684 million due principally to the increase in net income described above and improved inventory productivity as a result of the improvement in inventory turns to 38 times in 2002 from 35 times in 2001 the change in inventory in 2002 was an 80 million source of cash as compared against a 1188 million use of cash in 2001 also affecting cash flows from operating activities was the restatementrelated class action lawsuit settlement and related tax effects described above

critical accounting policies and estimates 

merchandise inventories merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined using the retail lastin firstout “lifo” method under the retail inventory method “rim” the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a calculated costtoretail ratio to the retail value of inventories the rim is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality also it is recognized that the use of the rim will result in valuing inventories at the lower of cost or market if markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories 

inherent in the rim calculation are certain significant management judgments and estimates including among others initial markups markdowns and shrinkage which significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as resulting gross margins these significant estimates coupled with the fact that the rim is an averaging process can under certain circumstances produce distorted cost figures factors that can lead to distortion in the calculation of the inventory balance include

 applying the rim to a group of products that is not fairly uniform in terms of its cost and selling price relationship and turnover

 applying the rim to transactions over a period of time that include different rates of gross profit such as those relating to seasonal merchandise

 inaccurate estimates of inventory shrinkage between the date of the last physical inventory at a store and the financial statement date

 inaccurate estimates of lifo reserves

to reduce the potential of such distortions in the valuation of inventory the company’s rim currently utilizes 10 departments in which fairly homogenous classes of merchandise inventories having similar gross margins are grouped in the near future in order to further refine its rim calculation the company intends to expand the number of departments it utilizes for its gross margin calculation the impact of this intended change on the company’s future consolidated financial statements cannot currently be estimated other factors that reduce potential distortion include the use of historical experience in estimating the shrink provision see discussion below and the utilization of an independent statistician to assist in the lifo sampling process and index formulation also on an ongoing basis the company reviews and evaluates the salability of its inventory and records adjustments if necessary to reflect its inventory at the lower of cost or market

the company calculates its shrink provision based on actual physical inventory results during the fiscal year and an accrual for estimated shrink occurring subsequent to a physical inventory through the end of the fiscal reporting period this accrual is calculated as a percentage of sales and is determined by dividing the sum of all booktophysical inventory adjustments recorded during the previous twelve months by the related sales for the same period during 2003 in an effort to improve this estimate the company applied storespecific shrink rates to storespecific sales generated subsequent to a given store’s physical inventory in 2002 and 2001 the company applied a weightedaverage shrink rate to all company sales generated subsequent to physical inventories to the extent that subsequent physical inventories yield different results than this estimated accrual the company’s shrink rate for a given reporting period will include the impact of adjusting the estimated results to the actual results

during 2003 the company implemented an itemlevel perpetual inventory system for financial reporting purposes this new system provides better information regarding the type of inventory that the company owns and improves the company’s ability to estimate its shrink provision the utilization of this improved information in the company’s rim calculation resulted in a nonrecurring inventory adjustment of approximately 78 million which favorably impacted gross margin in the third quarter of 2003

property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost the company groups its assets into relatively homogeneous classes and provides for depreciation on a straightline basis over the estimated average useful life of each asset class the valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful depreciable lives involves significant judgments and the use of estimates property and equipment are reviewed for impairment periodically and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 

selfinsurance liability the company retains a significant portion of the risk for its workers’ compensation employee health insurance general liability property loss and automobile coverage these costs are significant primarily due to the large employee base and number of stores provisions are made to this insurance liability on an undiscounted basis based on actual claim data and estimates of incurred but not reported claims developed by independent actuaries utilizing historical claim trends if future claim trends deviate from recent historical patterns the company may be required to record additional expenses or expense reductions which could be material to the company’s future financial results

contingent liabilities – income taxes  the company is subject to routine income tax audits which occur periodically in the normal course of business the company estimates its contingent income tax liabilities based on its assessment of potential income taxrelated exposures and the relative probabilities of those exposures translating into actual future liabilities the probabilities are estimated based on both historical audit experiences with various state and federal taxing authorities and the company’s interpretation of current income taxrelated trends if the company’s income tax contingent liability estimates prove to be inaccurate the resulting adjustments could be material to the company’s future financial results

effects of inflation and changing prices 

the company believes that inflation andor deflation had a minimal impact on its overall operations during 2003 2002 and 2001

accounting pronouncements 

in april 2002 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 145 “rescission of fasb statements no 4 44 and 64 amendment of fasb statement no 13 and technical corrections” sfas no 145 rescinds both sfas no 4 “reporting gains and losses from extinguishment of debt” and the amendment to sfas no 4 sfas no 64 “extinguishments of debt made to satisfy sinkingfund requirements” generally under sfas no 145 gains and losses from debt extinguishments will no longer be classified as extraordinary items the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 145 on february 1 2003 and the adoption of sfas no 145 did not have a material effect on the company’s financial statements as a whole

in july 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 146 “accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities” sfas no 146 nullifies emerging issues task force “eitf” issue no 943 “liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring” “eitf 943” sfas no 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred whereas eitf 943 had recognized the liability at the commitment date to an exit plan the company was required to adopt the provisions of sfas no 146 effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december 31 2002 the adoption of sfas no 146 did not have a material impact on the company’s financial statements as a whole

in november 2002 the eitf reached a consensus on eitf 0216 “accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor” which addresses the accounting and income statement classification for consideration given by a vendor to a retailer in connection with the sale of the vendor’s products or for the promotion of sales of the vendor’s products the eitf concluded that such consideration received from vendors should be reflected as a decrease in prices paid for inventory and recognized in cost of sales as the related inventory is sold unless specific criteria are met qualifying the consideration for treatment as reimbursement of specific identifiable incremental costs as clarified by the eitf in january 2003 this issue was effective for arrangements with vendors initiated on or after january 1 2003 the provisions of this consensus have been applied prospectively and are consistent with the company’s existing accounting policy accordingly the adoption of eitf 0216 did not have a material impact on the company’s financial statements as a whole

the company’s reputation and financial condition could be affected by the sec investigation as previously disclosed in the company’s periodic reports filed with the sec the company restated its audited financial statements for fiscal years 1999 and 1998 and certain unaudited financial information for fiscal year 2000 by means of its form 10k for the fiscal year ended february 2 2001 which was filed on january 14 2002 

the sec has been conducting an investigation into the circumstances giving rise to the restatement and on january 8 2004 the company received notice that the sec staff was considering recommending that the sec bring a civil injunctive action against the company for alleged violations of the federal securities laws in connection with circumstances relating to the restatement the company subsequently has reached an agreement in principle with the sec staff to settle the matter under the terms of the agreement in principle the company will consent without admitting or denying the allegations in a complaint to be filed by the sec to the entry of a permanent civil injunction against future violations of the antifraud books and records reporting and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws and related sec rules and will pay a 10 million nondeductible civil penalty the agreement with the sec staff is subject to final approval by the sec and the court in which the sec’s complaint is filed the company has accrued 10 million with respect to the penalty in its financial statements for the year ended january 30 2004 the company can give no assurances that the sec or the court will approve this agreement if the agreement is not approved the company could be subject to different or additional penalties both monetary and nonmonetary which could adversely affect the company’s financial statements as a whole the publicity surrounding the sec investigation and settlement also could affect the company’s reputation and have an adverse impact on its financial statements as a whole

the company’s business is modestly seasonal with the highest sales occurring during the fourth quarter adverse events during the fourth quarter could therefore affect the company’s financial statements as a whole  the company realizes a larger portion of its net sales and net income during the christmas selling season in anticipation of the holidays the company purchases substantial amounts of seasonal inventory and hires many temporary employees if for any reason the company’s net sales during the christmas selling season were to fall below seasonal norms a seasonal merchandise inventory imbalance could result if such an imbalance were to occur markdowns might be required to minimize this imbalance the company’s profitability and operating results could be adversely affected by unbudgeted markdowns 

adverse weather conditions or other disruptions especially during the peak christmas season but also at other times could also adversely affect the company’s net sales and could make it more difficult for the company to obtain sufficient quantities of merchandise from its suppliers

competition in the retail industry could limit the company’s growth opportunities and reduce its profitability the company competes in the discount retail merchandise business which is highly competitive this competitive environment subjects the company to the risk of reduced profitability resulting from reduced margins required to maintain the company’s competitive position the company competes with discount stores and with many other retailers including mass merchandise grocery drug convenience variety and other specialty stores some of the nation’s largest retail companies operate stores in areas where the company operates the company’s direct competitors in the dollar store retail category include family dollar dollar tree fred’s and various local independent operators competitors from other retail categories include cvs rite aid walgreens eckerd walmart and kmart the discount retail merchandise business is subject to excess capacity and some of the company’s competitors are much larger and have substantially greater resources than the company the competition for customers has intensified in recent years as larger competitors such as walmart have moved into the company’s geographic markets the company remains vulnerable to the marketing power and high level of consumer recognition of these major national discount chains and to the risk that these chains or others could venture into the “dollar store” industry in a significant way generally the company expects an increase in competition

the company’s financial performance is sensitive to changes in overall economic conditions that may impact consumer spending  a general slowdown in the united states economy may adversely affect the spending of the company’s consumers which would likely result in lower net sales than expected on a quarterly or annual basis future economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as employment levels business conditions fuel and energy costs interest rates and tax rates could also adversely affect the company’s business by reducing consumer spending or causing consumers to shift their spending to other products

existing military efforts and the possibility of war acts of terrorism and rising fuel costs could adversely impact the company existing us military efforts as well as the involvement of the united states in a war in the middle east or elsewhere or a significant act of terrorism on us soil or elsewhere could have an adverse impact on the company by among other things disrupting its information or distribution systems causing dramatic increases in fuel prices thereby increasing the costs of doing business or impeding the flow of imports or domestic products to the company

the company’s business is dependent on its ability to obtain attractive pricing and other terms from its vendors and to timely receive inventory  the company believes that it has generally good relations with its vendors and that it is generally able to obtain attractive pricing and other terms from vendors if the company fails to maintain good relations with its vendors it may not be able to obtain attractive pricing with the consequence that its net sales or profit margins would be reduced the company may also face difficulty in obtaining needed inventory from its vendors because of interruptions in production or for other reasons which would adversely affect the company’s business

the efficient operation of the company’s business is heavily dependent on its information systems  the company depends on a variety of information technology systems for the efficient functioning of its business the company relies on certain software vendors to maintain and periodically upgrade many of these systems so that they can continue to support the company’s business the software programs supporting many of the company’s systems were licensed to the company by independent software developers the inability of these developers or the company to continue to maintain and upgrade these information systems and software programs would disrupt or reduce the efficiency of the company’s operations if it were unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner in addition costs and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology could also disrupt or reduce the efficiency of the company’s operations

the company is subject to interest rate risk  the company is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on its financing investing and cash management activities the company may utilize its credit facility to fund working capital requirements which is comprised of variable rate debt see “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk”

the company is dependent upon the smooth functioning of its distribution network and upon the capacity of its dcs  the company relies upon the ability to replenish depleted inventory through deliveries to its dcs from vendors and from the dcs to its stores by various means of transportation including shipments by air sea and truck on the roads and highways of the united states the “driver hours of service” regulations adopted by the federal motor carriers safety administration which became effective january 4 2004 could negatively impact transportation costs in addition longterm disruptions to the national and international transportation infrastructure that lead to delays or interruptions of service would adversely affect the company’s business similarly delays in or interruptions in or caused by the expansion of dcs or the conversions of dcs to dual sortation would adversely affect the company’s business moreover to facilitate its expected growth the company will need additional dcs in the coming years if the company were unable to locate sites for the new dcs or were unable to achieve functionality of the new dcs in the time frame expected the company’s ability to achieve the expected growth could be inhibited

construction and expansion projects relating to the company’s dcs entail risks which could cause delays and cost overruns such as shortages of materials shortages of skilled labor or work stoppages unforeseen construction scheduling engineering environmental or geological problems weather interference fires or other casualty losses and unanticipated cost increases the completion dates and anticipated costs of these projects could differ significantly from initial expectations for constructionrelated or other reasons the company cannot guarantee that any project will be completed on time or within established budgets 

the company’s success depends to a significant extent upon the abilities of its senior management team and the performance of its employees the loss of services of key members of the company’s senior management team or of certain other key employees could negatively impact the company’s business in addition future performance will depend upon the company’s ability to attract retain and motivate qualified employees to keep pace with its expansion schedule the inability to do so may limit the company’s ability to effectively penetrate new market areas also the company experienced several senior management changes in 2003 significant difficulties in transitioning under new management could negatively impact the company’s business 

if the company cannot open new stores on schedule its growth will be impeded delays in store openings could adversely affect the company’s future operations by slowing new store growth which may in turn reduce its revenue growth the company’s ability to timely open new stores and to expand into additional states will depend in part on the following factors the availability of attractive store locations the ability to negotiate favorable lease terms the ability to hire and train new personnel especially store managers the ability to identify customer demand in different geographic areas general economic conditions and the availability of sufficient funds for expansion many of these factors are beyond the company’s control

the inability to execute operating initiatives could impact the company’s operating results the company is undertaking a significant number of operating initiatives in 2004 that have the potential to be disruptive in the short term if they are not implemented effectively ineffective implementation or execution of some or all of these initiatives could negatively impact the company’s operating results 

rising insurance costs could negatively impact profitability  the costs of insurance workers’ compensation insurance general liability insurance health insurance property insurance and directors’ and officers’ liability insurance have risen in recent years if such increases continue they could have a negative impact on the company’s profitability

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

financial risk management 

the company is exposed to market risk primarily from adverse changes in interest rates to minimize such risk the company may periodically use financial instruments including derivatives as a matter of policy the company does not buy or sell financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes and all financial instrument transactions must be authorized and executed pursuant to board of directors approval all financial instrument positions taken by the company are used to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure because of high correlation between the financial instrument and the underlying exposure being hedged fluctuations in the value of the financial instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying economic exposure the financial instruments used by the company are straightforward instruments with liquid markets

the company has cash flow exposure relating to variable interest rates associated with its revolving line of credit and may periodically seek to manage this risk through the use of interest rate derivatives the primary interest rate exposure on variable rate obligations is based on the london interbank offered rate “libor” 

at january 30 2004 and january 31 2003 the fair value of the company’s debt excluding capital lease obligations was estimated at approximately 2654 million net of the fair value of a note receivable on the south boston virginia dc of 489 million as further discussed in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements and 2870 million respectively based on the estimated market value of the debt at those dates such fair value was greater than the carrying value of the debt at january 30 2004 by approximately 217 million and less than the carrying value of the debt at january 31 2003 by approximately 74 million

at february 1 2002 the company was party to an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of 100 million the company designated this agreement as a hedge of its floating rate commitments relating to a portion of certain synthetic lease agreements that existed at that time under the terms of the agreement the company paid a fixed rate of 560 and received a floating rate libor on the 100 million notional amount through september 1 2002 the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement was 26 million at february 1 2002 the counterparty to the company’s interest rate swap agreement was a major financial institution the interest rate swap agreement expired on september 1 2002 as of january 30 2004 the company was not party to any interest rate derivatives 

in 2002 and 2001 as required by sfas no 133 the company recorded the fair value of the interest rate swap in the balance sheet with the offsetting effective portion of the change in fair value recorded in other comprehensive loss a separate component of shareholders’ equity in the consolidated financial statements amounts recorded in other comprehensive loss were reclassified into earnings as an adjustment to interest expense in the same period during which the hedged synthetic lease agreements affected earnings 

based upon the company’s variable rate borrowing levels a 1 adverse change in interest rates would have resulted in a pretax reduction of earnings and cash flows of approximately 17 million including the effects of interest rate swaps in 2002 in 2003 the company had no outstanding variable rate borrowings based upon the company’s outstanding indebtedness at january 30 2004 and january 31 2003 a 1 reduction in interest rates would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of the company’s fixed rate debt of approximately 148 million and 176 million respectively

growth strategy 

the company has experienced a rapid rate of expansion in recent years increasing its number of stores from 2059 as of january 31 1995 to 6192 as of february 28 2003 in addition to growth from new store openings the company recorded samestore sales increases of 57 73 and 09 in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively samestore sales increases are calculated based on the comparable calendar weeks in the prior year samestore sales calculations include only those stores that were open both at the end of a fiscal year and at the beginning of the preceding fiscal year management will continue to seek to grow the company’s business the company believes this growth will come from a combination of new store openings infrastructure investments and merchandising initiatives

the company is engaged in a highly competitive business with respect to price store location merchandise quality assortment and presentation instock consistency and customer service the company competes with discount stores and with many other retailers including mass merchandise grocery drug convenience variety and other specialty stores some of the nation’s largest retail companies operate stores in areas where the company operates the company’s direct competitors in the dollar store retail category include family dollar dollar tree fred’s and various local independent operators competitors from other retail categories include cvs rite aid walgreens eckerd walmart and kmart some of the company’s competitors from outside the dollar store segment are better capitalized than the company

the dollar store category differentiates itself from other forms of retailing by offering consistently low prices in a convenient smallstore format the company’s prices are competitive because of its low cost operating structure and the relatively limited assortment of products offered labor and marketing expenses are minimized by not using circulars limiting price points and relying on simple merchandise presentation occupancy expenses are typically low because the company attempts to locate in second tier locations either in small towns or in the neighborhoods of urban areas where such expenses are relatively low the company believes that its limited assortment of products allows it to focus its purchasing efforts on fewer skus than other retailers which helps keep its cost of goods relatively low

the securities and exchange commission is conducting an investigation into the circumstances that gave rise to the company’s april 30 2001 announcement the company is cooperating with this investigation by providing documents testimony and other information to the securities and exchange commission at this time the company is unable to predict the outcome of this investigation and the ultimate effects on the company if any

as previously discussed in the company’s periodic reports filed with the securities and exchange commission the company and the individual current and former company director and officer defendants settled the lead shareholder derivative action relating to the restatement that had been filed in tennessee state court 

the settlement agreement provided for a payment to the company from a portion of the proceeds of the company’s director and officer liability insurance policies as well as certain corporate governance and internal control enhancements the terms of such agreement required that all of the derivative cases including the federal derivative cases previously described in the company’s periodic reports filed with the securities and exchange commission be dismissed with prejudice by the courts in which they were pending in order for the settlement to be effective following confirmatory discovery the settlement agreement received final approval by the tennessee state court on june 4 2002 all other derivative cases pending in the tennessee state court were subsequently dismissed the federal derivative actions were dismissed on september 3 2002

the settlement of the shareholder derivative lawsuits resulted in a net payment to the company after attorneys’ fees payable to the plaintiffs’ counsel of approximately 252 million in august 2002 which was recorded as income during the third quarter of 2002

also as previously discussed in the company’s periodic reports filed with the securities and exchange commission the company settled the consolidated restatementrelated class action lawsuit filed in the united states district court for the middle district of tennessee on behalf of a class of persons who purchased or otherwise made an investment decision regarding the company’s securities and related derivative securities between march 5 1997 and january 14 2002 the 162 million settlement was approved by the court on may 24 2002 and was paid in the first half of 2002 this amount had been previously expensed by the company in the fourth quarter of 2000 the company received from its insurers 45 million in respect of such settlement in july 2002 which was recorded as income during the second quarter of 2002 in connection with the settlement plaintiffs representing fewer than 1 of the shares traded during the class period chose to opt out of the class settlement and may elect to pursue recovery against the company individually in the fourth quarter of 2002 the company reached an agreement to settle and paid a claim by one such plaintiff and recognized an expense of 02 million in respect of such agreement to the company’s knowledge no other litigation has yet been filed or threatened by parties who opted out of the class action settlement the company cannot predict whether any additional litigation will be filed or estimate the potential liabilities associated with such litigation but it does not believe that the resolution of any such litigation will have a material effect on the company’s financial position or results of operations

other litigation 

on march 14 2002 a complaint was filed in the united states district court for the northern district of alabama to commence a purported collective action against the company on behalf of current and former salaried store managers the complaint alleges that these individuals were entitled to overtime pay and should not have been classified as exempt employees under the fair labor standards act “flsa” plaintiffs seek to recover overtime pay liquidated damages declaratory relief and attorneys’ fees this action is still in the initial discovery phase and the court has not found that the case should proceed as a collective action the company believes that its store managers are and have been properly classified as exempt employees under the flsa and that the action is not appropriate for collective action treatment the company intends to vigorously defend the action however no assurances can be given that the company will be successful in defending this action on the merits or otherwise  and if not the resolution could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position or results of operations

the company is involved in other legal actions and claims arising in the ordinary course of business the company currently believes that such litigation and claims both individually and in the aggregate will be resolved without material effect on the company’s financial position or results of operations however litigation involves an element of uncertainty future developments could cause these actions or claims to have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position or results of operations

management’s discussion and analysis of financial 

condition and results of operations 

general 

accounting periods  the following text contains references to years 2003 2002 2001 and 2000 which represent fiscal years ending or ended january 30 2004 january 31 2003 february 1 2002 and february 2 2001 respectively there were 53 weeks in the fiscal year ended february 2 2001 there were 52 weeks in the fiscal years ended january 31 2003 and february 1 2002 there will be 52 weeks in the fiscal year ended january 30 2004 this discussion and analysis should be read with and is qualified in its entirety by the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in item 8 please note that by means of its annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended february 2 2001 filed on january 14 2002 the company restated certain unaudited financial information for fiscal year 2000 that had been previously released by the company the following discussion reflects the results of that restatement

overview of 2002  during 2002 dollar general increased its net sales by 146 primarily as a result of its continued rapid pace of new store openings from 2000 through 2002 the company had a compounded annual net sales growth rate of 162 samestore sales increased 57 in 2002 as compared with increases of 73 and 09 in 2001 and 2000 respectively samestore sales increases are calculated based on the comparable calendar weeks in the prior year samestore sales calculations include only those stores that were open both at the end of a fiscal year and at the beginning of the preceding fiscal year 

the year 2002 marked the fifteenth consecutive year that the company increased its total number of store units the company opened 622 new stores in 2002 compared with 602 in 2001 and 758 in 2000 and remodeled or relocated 73 stores compared with 78 in 2001 and 237 in 2000 during the last three years the company has opened remodeled or relocated 2370 stores accounting for approximately 39 of its total stores as of january 31 2003 the company ended 2002 with 6113 stores

in 2002 new stores remodels and relocations net of 49 closed stores added an aggregate of approximately 38 million square feet of selling space to the company’s total sales space as a result the company had an aggregate of approximately 41 million square feet of selling space at the end of the year the average new store opened in 2002 and 2001 had approximately 6500 selling square feet virtually all of the new stores opened in 2002 are subject to traditional operating lease arrangements 

the company currently expects to open approximately 650 new stores in 2003 within its existing market area close 50 to 70 stores and remodel or relocate approximately 145 stores the new store openings in 2003 are expected to be divided evenly between small towns and more densely populated areas and generally will be within 250 miles of existing distribution centers the company expects its new stores to be subject to traditional operating lease arrangements capital expenditures related to new store openings will be financed through a combination of cash flows from operations and existing credit facilities

the company focused on the following key initiatives in 2002 standardizing work processes to improve the execution of basic retail tasks completing the rollout of store perpetual inventories executing an effective disposition program for certain excess inventory identified in the fourth quarter of 2000 and implementing the arthur merchandise planning system to improve its merchandise planning process the company made substantial progress in 2002 on each of these initiatives the company launched the “seven habits of a highly effective dollar general store” which is a program designed to improve store level execution in the areas of ordering receiving stocking presentation selling support and staffing as of january 31 2003 all of the company’s stores are on a perpetual inventory system which allows the company to track store level inventory at the sku level during 2002 the company liquidated all but approximately 25 million at cost of the aforementioned excess inventory and the company implemented the product and location planning channel clustering demand forecasting and performance analysis modules of the arthur merchandise planning system

critical accounting policies 

merchandise inventories merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined using the retail lastin firstout “lifo” method under the retail inventory method “rim” the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a calculated costtoretail ratio to the retail value of inventories rim is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality also it is recognized that the use of the rim will result in valuing inventories at lower of cost or market if markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories 

inherent in the rim calculation are certain significant management judgments and estimates including among others initial markups markdowns and shrinkage which significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as resulting gross margins these significant estimates coupled with the fact that the rim is an averaging process can under certain circumstances produce distorted or inaccurate cost figures factors that can lead to distortion in the calculation of the inventory balance include

•

applying the rim to a group of products that is not fairly uniform in terms of its cost and selling price relationship and turnover

•

applying rim to transactions over a period of time that include different rates of gross profit such as those relating to seasonal merchandise

•

inaccurate estimates of inventory shrinkage between the date of the last physical inventory at a store and the financial statement date

•

inaccurate estimates of lifo reserves

to reduce the potential of such distortions in the valuation of inventory from occurring the company’s rim utilizes 10 departments in which fairly homogenous classes of merchandise inventories having similar gross margins are grouped the company estimates its shrink provision based on historical experience and utilizes an outside statistician to assist in the lifo sampling process and index formulation on a periodic basis the company reviews and evaluates its inventory and records an adjustment if necessary to reflect its inventory at the lower of cost or market

management believes that the company’s rim provides an inventory valuation which reasonably approximates cost and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market

as previously discussed the company collected sku level inventory information at each of its stores during 2002 in connection with its establishment of an itembased perpetual inventory system in conjunction with this undertaking in an effort to improve inventory valuation and cost of goods sold estimates the company will be refining estimates of its retail ownership mix and expanding the number of departments it utilizes for its gross margin calculations the company has not established a date for these changes which may result in an inventory adjustment and may also impact the rim calculation results in the year of adoption and in subsequent years the impact of such changes on the company’s consolidated financial statements cannot currently be estimated

the implementation of the itembased perpetual inventory system in 2002 has improved our ability to identify items where we are carrying more inventory than our sales information would suggest is necessary the company intends to evaluate such information on an ongoing basis and take periodic markdowns to ensure the salability of our inventory

property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost the company provides for depreciation on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets the valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful depreciable lives involves significant judgments and the use of estimates property and equipment are reviewed for impairment periodically and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 

selfinsurance liability the company retains a significant portion of the risk for its workers’ compensation employee health insurance general liability property loss and automobile coverage these costs are significant primarily due to the large employee base and number of stores provisions are made to this insurance liability on an undiscounted basis based on actual claim data and estimates of incurred but not reported claims developed by outside actuaries utilizing historical claim trends if future claim trends deviate from recent historical patterns the company may be required to record additional expense or expense reductions which could be material to the company’s results of operations

results of operations 

the following discussion of the company’s financial performance is based on the consolidated financial statements set forth herein

net sales  net sales totaled 610 billion for 2002 532 billion for 2001 and 455 billion for 2000 representing annual increases of 146 in 2002 170 in 2001 and 170 in 2000 the increases resulted primarily from 573 net new stores and a samestore sales increase of 57 in 2002 540 net new stores and a samestore sales increase of 73 in 2001 and 706 net new stores and a samestore sales increase of 09 in 2000 

the company tracks its sales internally by four major categories highly consumable seasonal home products and basic clothing total sales in the highly consumable category increased by 191 225 and 261 in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively total sales in the seasonal category increased by 119 258 and 102 in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively total sales in the home products category experienced annual changes of 53 06 and 05 in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively total sales in the basic clothing category increased by 70 50 and 149 in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively 

the company’s 2002 samestore sales increase of 57 was due to a number of factors including but not limited to the introduction of approximately 400 new items in the highly consumable category a strong performance of seasonal merchandise in the first half of 2002 due in part to the introduction of new outdoor items and the staging of warm weather items in our stores earlier than in prior years an increase in the number of stores offering perishable products from 411 at the end of 2001 to 1367 at the end of 2002 and improved ordering practices by our store employees

the company attributes the 73 samestore sales increase that it achieved in 2001 to a number of factors including but not limited to an improved instock position an increase in the number of stores offering perishable products from 20 in 2000 to 411 by the end of 2001 strong sales of seasonal merchandise resulting in part from additional floor space dedicated to such items as part of the store reset program described below that was undertaken in 2000 and expanded offerings in certain highly consumable categories including home cleaning paper products and pet supplies

the company believes that the lower same store sales increase in 2000 was due primarily to the disruptive effect of a comprehensive store reset program designed to improve the product mix and appearance of its stores which affected the vast majority of the store base other factors that may have had an impact on the lower same store sales increase in 2000 include a change in store ordering procedures from a manual process to a new automated system relying on the scanning of shelf tags which may have been an additional cause of the sporadic outofstock conditions experienced by the company during this period and a general softening of economic conditions

gross profit  gross profit for 2002 was 172 billion or 283 of sales compared with 151 billion or 284 of sales in 2001 and 125 billion or 275 of sales in 2000

the slight decline in the gross profit rate in 2002 as compared with 2001 is due primarily to an increase in the company’s shrinkage provision as further described below the company improved its initial margin on inventory purchases in all four of its major categories in 2002 as compared against 2001 however the continued shift in the company’s sales mix to lower margin highly consumable items limited the year over year increase in the total initial margin rate to 7 basis points the company recorded an 89 million adjustment and a 35 million adjustment in the fourth quarters of 2002 and 2001 respectively pertaining to its lifo valuation which had the effect of increasing gross profit in both years these adjustments are primarily the result of the company’s ability to lower its product costs through effective purchasing methods and the general lack of inflation in the current economic environment

the improvement in the gross profit rate in 2001 as compared to 2000 was due primarily to the 215 million effect of a markdown recorded in 2000 as described in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements the markdown in 2000 resulted from the identification by the company of certain excess inventories that it believed would require a markdown to assist with their disposition by the conclusion of 2002 the company also improved its initial margin on inventory purchases by 48 basis points in 2001 as compared against 2000 the company was able to make particular improvements in its inventory margin in the housewares seasonal and mens and boys clothing product lines 

inventory shrinkage calculated at the retail value of the inventory as a percentage of sales was 352 in 2002 290 in 2001 and 280 in 2000 some of the actions taken by the company in 2002 to combat shrink include the hiring of an asset protection professional the development of an asset protection monthly scorecard the installation of loss prevention software that identifies unusual cash register transactions increasing the emphasis of shrink in the store bonus plan and the establishment of a multidisciplinary shrink task force that has developed a comprehensive shrink reduction action plan some of the components of the action plan include increased use of closed circuit television monitors and burglar alarms a specific high shrink store action plan the creation of various shrink awareness tools and the production of various exception reports to identify high risk stores

distribution and transportation costs decreased by 13 basis points as a percentage of sales in 2002 as compared to 2001 the reduction in distribution and transportation costs as a percentage of sales was due primarily to freight occupancy and depreciation expenses that grew at a rate less than the sales increase factors contributing to this result in 2002 include lower fuel costs during the first half of the year an effective freight revenue sharing program whereby the company picks up product directly from its vendors as opposed to having it shipped and the fact that distribution center occupancy costs are relatively fixed in comparison with the growth in our sales base

distribution and transportation costs decreased by 35 basis points as a percentage of sales in 2001 as compared to 2000 the reduction in distribution and transportation costs as a percentage of sales in 2001 was due primarily to a relatively modest increase in transportation costs during a period of increased sales factors contributing to this result in 2001 included the opening of the zanesville ohio dc which supported continued expansion in the number of stores with only a modest increase in store delivery miles increased trailer utilization as a result of improved routing and lower fuel costs 

selling general and administrative expense  total selling general and administrative “sga” expense as a percentage of net sales was 213 in 2002 and 2001 compared with 205 in 2000 sga expense in 2002 was 130 billion an increase of 142 compared to 2001 sga expense in 2001 was 114 billion an increase of 215 compared to 2000

in 2002 the company incurred 64 million in expenses primarily professional fees related to the restatement of the company’s financial statements as described above in item 3 the company incurred 284 million of such expenses in 2001 excluding restatementrelated expenses from both years sga expenses in 2002 would have been 129 billion or 211 of sales as compared with 111 billion or 208 of sales in 2001 an increase of 165 the increase in sga expense as a percentage of sales excluding restatement expenses in 2002 was due to a number of factors including but not limited to increases in the following expense categories that were in excess of the percentage increase in sales store labor workers’ compensation claims store occupancy and store repairs and maintenance

the 80 basis point increase in sga expense as a percentage of net sales experienced in 2001 was due in part to the 284 million in restatementrelated expenses referred to above there were no such expenses in 2000 and such expenses recorded in 2001 were in addition to the litigation settlement expense described below that was recorded in 2000 the increase in sga expense in 2001 was also attributable in part to a 194 increase in labor expenses at the company’s retail stores which was in excess of the company’s sales increase of 170 the increased labor expenses incurred in 2001 resulted from a decision by the company’s management to spend additional funds in this area in order to attract and retain the talented employees necessary to improve store conditions the restatementrelated expenses and the increased store labor costs together accounted for a 69 basis point increase in sga expense excluding the restatementrelated expenses sga expense in 2001 would have increased 184 over the prior year

litigation settlement expense and related proceeds  the company recorded 295 million in net restatement litigation proceeds during 2002 which amount included 297 million in insurance proceeds associated with the settlement of the restatementrelated class action and shareholder derivative litigation offset by a 02 million settlement of a shareholder class action optout claim related to the company’s restatement no litigation settlement expense was recorded in 2001 the company recorded 1620 million of expense in 2000 for the settlement of the restatementrelated shareholder class action litigation see item 3 

interest expense  in 2002 interest expense was 426 million compared with 458 million in 2001 and 454 million in 2000 the decrease in interest expense in 2002 as compared to 2001 is due primarily to debt reduction achieved during 2002 

the average daily total debt outstanding in 2002 was 5757 million at an average interest rate of 66 the average daily total debt outstanding in 2001 was 7388 million at an average interest rate of 63 the average daily total debt outstanding in 2000 was 7103 million at an average interest rate of 72 

provision for taxes on income  the effective income tax rates for 2002 2001 and 2000 were 361 367 and 350 respectively the lower effective tax rate in 2002 was primarily due to recording higher work opportunity tax credits than in 2001 and the favorable resolution of certain state tax related items during 2002 the lower effective tax rate in 2000 was due to the 389 marginal tax rate applied against the litigation settlement expense excluding the tax impact of the litigation settlement expense the effective tax rate in 2000 was 373

net income  net income in 2002 was 2649 million or 43 of sales versus 2075 million or 39 of sales in 2001 and 706 million or 16 of sales in 2000 diluted earnings per share in 2002 were 079 versus 062 in 2001 and 021 in 2000 excluding the restatementrelated expenses and the litigation settlement expense and related proceeds noted above diluted earnings per share in 2002 were 075 versus 067 in 2001 and 051 in 2000

forward looking statements  risk factors 

some of the statements in this form 10k and in the documents incorporated by reference into this form 10k are forwardlooking statements for example some statements may express or imply projections of revenues or expenditures statements of plans and objectives for future operations or statements of future economic performance also the words “believe” “anticipate” “project” “plan” “expect” “estimate” “objective” “forecast” “goal” “intend” “will likely result” or “will continue” and similar expressions generally identify forwardlooking statements these and similar statements are forwardlooking statements concerning matters that involve risks uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual performance of the company to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these statements all forwardlooking information should be evaluated in the context of these risks uncertainties and other factors the company believes the assumptions underlying these forwardlooking statements are reasonable however any of the assumptions could be inaccurate and therefore actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forwardlooking statements the factors and risks that may result in actual results differing from such forwardlooking information include but are not limited to

the company’s reputation and financial condition could be affected by the restatement andor the pending sec investigation as previously disclosed the company announced on april 30 2001 that it had become aware of certain accounting issues that would cause it to restate its audited financial statements for fiscal years 1999 and 1998 and to restate the unaudited financial information for fiscal year 2000 that had been previously released by the company the company subsequently restated such financial statements and financial information by means of its form 10k for the fiscal year ended february 2 2001 which was filed on january 14 2002

the sec is conducting an investigation into the circumstances that gave rise to the company’s april 30 2001 announcement the company is cooperating with this investigation by providing documents testimony and other information to the sec at this time the company is unable to predict the outcome of this investigation and the ultimate effects on the company if any in addition the publicity surrounding the sec investigation could affect the company’s reputation and have an impact on its financial condition

the company’s business is modestly seasonal with the highest sales occurring during the fourth quarter adverse events during the fourth quarter could therefore affect the company’s financial condition and results of operations  the company realizes a larger portion of its net sales and net income during the christmas selling season in anticipation of the holidays the company purchases substantial amounts of seasonal inventory and hires many temporary employees if for any reason the company’s net sales during the christmas selling season were to fall below seasonal norms a seasonal merchandise inventory imbalance could result if such an imbalance were to occur markdowns might be required to minimize this imbalance the company’s profitability and operating results could be adversely affected by unbudgeted markdowns 

adverse weather conditions or other disruptions especially during the peak christmas season could also adversely affect the company’s net sales and could make it more difficult for the company to obtain sufficient quantities of merchandise from its suppliers

competition in the retail industry could limit the company’s growth opportunities and reduce its profitability the company competes in the discount retail merchandise business which is highly competitive this competitive environment subjects the company to the risk of reduced profitability resulting from reduced margins required to maintain the company’s competitive position the company competes with discount stores and with many other retailers including mass merchandise grocery drug convenience variety and other specialty stores some of the nation’s largest retail companies operate stores in areas where the company operates the company’s direct competitors in the dollar store retail category include family dollar dollar tree fred’s and various local independent operators competitors from other retail categories include cvs rite aid walgreens eckerd walmart and kmart the discount retail merchandise business is subject to excess capacity and some of the company’s competitors are much larger and have substantially greater resources than the company the competition for customers has intensified in recent years as larger competitors such as walmart have moved into the company’s geographic markets the company remains vulnerable to the marketing power and high level of consumer recognition of these major national discount chains and to the risk that these chains or others could venture into the “dollar store” industry in a significant way generally the company expects an increase in competition

the company’s financial performance is sensitive to changes in overall economic conditions that may impact consumer spending  a general slowdown in the united states economy may adversely affect the spending of the company’s consumers which would likely result in lower net sales than expected on a quarterly or annual basis future economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as employment levels business conditions fuel and energy costs interest rates and tax rates could also adversely affect the company’s business by reducing consumer spending or causing consumers to shift their spending to other products

possibility of war acts of terrorism and rising fuel costs could adversely impact the company the involvement of the united states in a war in the middle east or elsewhere or a significant act of terrorism on us soil or elsewhere could have an adverse impact on the company by among other things disrupting its information or distribution systems causing dramatic increases in fuel prices thereby increasing the costs of doing business or impeding the flow of imports or domestic products to the company

the company’s business is dependent on its vendors  the company believes that it has generally good relations with its vendors and that it is generally able to obtain attractive pricing and other terms from vendors if the company fails to maintain good relations with its vendors it may not be able to obtain attractive pricing with the consequence that its net sales or profit margins would be reduced the company may also face difficulty in obtaining needed inventory from its vendors because of interruptions in production or for other reasons which would adversely affect the company’s business

the efficient operation of the company’s business is heavily dependent on its information systems  the company depends on a variety of information technology systems for the efficient functioning of its business the company relies on certain software vendors to maintain and periodically upgrade many of these systems so that they can continue to support the company’s business the software programs supporting many of the company’s systems were licensed to the company by independent software developers the inability of these developers or the company to continue to maintain and upgrade these information systems and software programs would disrupt or reduce the efficiency of the company’s operations if it were unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner in addition costs and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology could also disrupt or reduce the efficiency of the company’s operations

the company is subject to interest rate risk  the company is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on its financing investing and cash management activities the company may utilize a credit facility to fund working capital requirements which is comprised of variable rate debt see “item 7a – quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk”

the company is dependent upon the smooth functioning of its distribution network  the company relies upon the ability to replenish depleted inventory through deliveries to its dcs from vendors and from the dcs to its stores by various means of transportation including shipments by air sea and truck on the roads and highways of the united states longterm disruptions to the national and international transportation infrastructure that lead to delays or interruptions of service would adversely affect the company’s business moreover to facilitate its expected growth the company will need additional dcs in the coming years if the company were unable to locate sites for the new dcs the company’s ability to achieve the expected growth could be inhibited

our success depends to a significant extent upon the abilities of our senior management the loss of services of any of the members of our senior management or of certain other key employees could negatively impact our business in addition our future performance will depend upon our ability to attract retain and motivate qualified employees to keep pace with our expansion schedule our inability to do so may limit our ability to effectively penetrate new market areas also as previously announced cal turner who has served as our chief executive officer since 1977 and as our chairman of the board since 1989 stepped down as ceo in 2002 any difficulties in transitioning under new management could negatively impact our business 

if we cannot open new stores on schedule our growth will be impeded delays in store openings could adversely affect our future operations by slowing new store growth which may in turn reduce our revenue growth our ability to timely open new stores will depend in part on the following factors the availability of attractive store locations our ability to negotiate favorable lease terms our ability to hire and train new personnel especially store managers our ability to identify customer demand in different geographic areas general economic conditions and the availability of sufficient funds for expansion many of these factors are beyond our control

rising insurance costs could negatively impact profitability  the costs of insurance workers’ compensation insurance general liability insurance health insurance and directors’ and officers’ liability insurance have risen in recent years if such increases continue they could have a negative impact on our profitability

the company is dependent on the continued availability of capital to support its business a decline in the company’s generation of cash flow or the inability of the company to obtain financing from third parties would have a material adverse effect on the company

on april 10 2002 moody’s investors service inc lowered the company’s senior unsecured credit rating from ba1 to ba2 which rating is on review for further possible downgrades on april 12 2002 standard  poor’s lowered the company’s corporate credit senior unsecured debt and senior unsecured bank loan ratings from bbb to bb as of the date hereof these ratings remain on creditwatch with negative implications credit ratings are generally used by investors to assess the ability of a company to meet its obligations the downgrade in the company’s credit ratings may affect the company’s ability to obtain financing in the future and will also affect the terms of any such financing

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

financial risk management 

the company is exposed to market risk primarily from adverse changes in interest rates to minimize such risk the company may periodically use financial instruments including derivatives as a matter of policy the company does not buy or sell financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes and all financial instrument transactions must be authorized and executed pursuant to board of directors approval all financial instrument positions taken by the company are used to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure because of high correlation between the financial instrument and the underlying exposure being hedged fluctuations in the value of the financial instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying economic exposure the financial instruments used by the company are straightforward instruments with liquid markets

the company has cash flow exposure relating to variable interest rates associated with its revolving line of credit and may periodically seek to manage this risk through the use of interest rate derivatives the primary interest rate exposure on variable rate obligations is based on the london interbank offered rate “libor” 

at january 31 2003 and february 1 2002 the fair value of the company’s debt excluding capital lease obligations was estimated at approximately 2870 million and 2685 million respectively based on the estimated market value of the debt at those dates such fair value is less than the carrying value of the debt at january 31 2003 and february 1 2002 by approximately 74 million and 271 million respectively

at february 1 2002 the company was party to an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of 100 million the company designated this agreement as a hedge of its floating rate commitments relating to a portion of its synthetic lease agreements under the terms of the agreement the company paid a fixed rate of 560 and received a floating rate libor on the 100 million notional amount through september 1 2002 the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement was 26 million at february 1 2002 the counterparty to the company’s interest rate swap agreement was a major financial institution the interest rate swap agreement expired on september 1 2002 and as of january 31 2003 the company was not party to any interest rate derivatives 

in 2002 and 2001 as required by sfas no 133 the company recorded the fair value of the interest rate swap in the balance sheet with the offsetting effective portion of the change in fair value recorded in other comprehensive loss a separate component of shareholders’ equity in the consolidated financial statements amounts recorded in other comprehensive loss were reclassified into earnings as an adjustment to interest expense in the same period during which the hedged synthetic lease agreements affected earnings in fiscal 2000 as required by the accounting literature for derivatives and hedging instruments in effect at that time the company recognized any differences paid or received on interest rate swap agreements as adjustments to interest expense

based upon the company’s variable rate borrowing levels a 1 change in interest rates would have resulted in a pretax loss in earnings and cash flows of approximately 17 million and 28 million including the effects of interest rate swaps in 2002 and 2001 respectively in 2003 the company does not anticipate the potential loss due to a 1 change in interest rates to vary materially from the estimated impact in 2002

recent developments

               restatement of financial statements on april 30 2001 the

would cause it to restate its audited financial statements for fiscal years 1999
and 1998 and to restate the unaudited financial information for the fiscal year
2000 that had been previously released by the company the audit committee of
the board of directors promptly assumed oversight of the companys response to

firm of dechert price and rhoads and the independent accounting firm arthur

and chief executive officer had directed the companys financial staff and its

assistance of the companys outside counsel debevoise  plimpton and
accounting consultants from kpmg llp

               consistent with the activities of the audit committee and the
companys review of its financial statements for the 1998 1999 and 2000 fiscal
years the company is restating by means of this filing its audited financial
statements for fiscal years 1999 and 1998 and is filing herewith its audited
financial results for fiscal year 2000 which restate the unaudited financial
information for the fiscal year 2000 that had been previously released by the
company the companys previously released financial data should not be relied
upon

               restated net income and diluted earnings per share for 2000 are
706 million and 021 respectively as compared to the 2060 million and
062 previously reported the restated results for 2000 include a pretax
expense of 1620 million to settle the companys restatementrelated litigation
described below excluding the litigation settlement expense restated net
income and diluted earnings per share for 2000 are 1696 million and 051
respectively restated net income totaled 1867 million in fiscal 1999 and
1509 million in fiscal 1998 equaling diluted earnings per share of 055 and
045 respectively the company originally reported prior to the restatement
net income of 2194 million in fiscal 1999 and 1820 million in fiscal 1998
equaling diluted earnings per share for those periods of 065 and 054
respectively

               in its april 30 2001 announcement based on a preliminary
assessment of the accounting issues involved the company estimated that the
reduction in aggregate earnings as a result of the restatement would be
approximately 007 per share over the threeyear period of 2000 1999 and 1998
the review completed by the company of its financial statements ultimately
identified a number of accounting issues for restatement in addition to those
that formed the basis for the preliminary estimate provided on april 30 2001
as a result of these additional issues and following the completion of the
companys review of the issues that had been identified originally the
restatement has resulted in an aggregate effect on diluted earnings per share
excluding the litigation settlement expense of 030 over the threeyear period
of 2000 1999 and 1998

               the issues for restatement excluding the litigation settlement
expense can be broken down into four general categories i items impacting
the cost of goods sold that were recorded incorrectly andor that reflect more
accurate estimates ii selling general and administrative sga expenses
that were either incurred but not accrued or recorded incorrectly iii
additional interest expense required as a result of restating certain operating
leases as capital leases and financing obligations and the addition of capital
lease and financing obligation liabilities to the companys balance sheets and
iv changes to the companys income tax provision to correct errors the
effects of these issues on diluted earnings per share over the threeyear period
are summarized in the following table

               dollar general stores offer a focused assortment of quality
consumable basic merchandise in a number of core categories the company
separates its merchandise into the following four divisions for internal
reporting purposes 1 highly consumable 2 hardware and seasonal 3 basic
clothing and 4 home products

               since 1997 the company has increased its emphasis on the highly
consumable division by adding items in the food paper household chemicals and
health and beauty care categories during the same period the company has
reduced its emphasis on the home products division by eliminating items such as
bath mats area rugs and bath towels in 1998 the company introduced
approximately 400 new stockkeeping units skus of familyoriented basic
apparel including items such as jeans khakis tshirts and knit shirts for men

               the company purchases its merchandise from a wide variety of
suppliers no supplier accounted for more than 13 of the companys purchases in
2000 approximately 12 of the companys purchases in 2000 were imported

the companys average customer purchase in 2000 was 827 the average number of
items in each customer purchase was 58 and the average price of each purchased
item was 142

               as indicated in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements
the company believes that it has certain excess inventory that will require a
markdown to assist with its disposition accordingly the company recorded a
markdown which had the impact of reducing inventory at cost at february 2 2001
and increasing cost of goods sold in the fourth quarter of 2000 by approximately
215 million the company believes that this markdown will be adequate to
ensure the sale of the excess inventory during fiscal years 2001 and 2002
however there can be no assurance that the company will be able to sell all of
this inventory by the end of 2002 without a further markdown the company moved
1160 million of inventory out of current assets at february 2 2001 that it
does not expect to sell during 2001

               the companys business is modestly seasonal in nature the only
extended seasonal increase in business that the company experiences is the
christmas selling season during the christmas selling season the company
carries merchandise that it does not carry during the rest of the year such as
gift sets trimatree certain baking items and a broader assortment of toys
and candy in 2000 1999 and 1998 the fourth quarter generated 32 30 and 31
of the companys total annual revenues respectively although all four of the
companys divisions experienced their highest sales in the fourth quarter the
hardware and seasonal division had the largest increases

competition

               the company is engaged in a highly competitive business the
company competes with discount stores and with many other retailers including
mass merchandise grocery drug convenience variety and other specialty
stores some of the nations largest retail companies operate stores in areas
where the company operates the companys direct competitors in the dollar store
retail categories include family dollar dollar tree freds and various local
independent operators competitors from other retail categories include cvs
rite aid walgreens eckerds walmart and kmart some of the companys
competitors from outside the dollar store segment are better capitalized than
the company

               the dollar store category differentiates itself from other forms
of retailing by offering consistently low prices in a convenient smallstore
format recently conducted independent research indicates that the average
dollar store customer visits a store approximately 90 times each year the
companys prices are competitive because of its low cost operating structure and
the relatively limited assortment of products offered labor and marketing
expenses are minimized by not using circulars limiting price points and
relying on simple merchandise presentation occupancy expenses are typically low
because the company attempts to locate in second tier locations either in small
towns or in the neighborhoods of more urban areas where such expenses are low


                                       12

the company believes that its limited assortment of products allows it to focus
its purchasing efforts on fewer skus than other retailers which helps keep the
cost of goods low

those breaches and was negligent in its service as the companys independent
accountant during august and september 2001 the company moved to dismiss all
six cases for failure to make a presuit demand on the board of directors and
in the alternative requested that the court stay the actions pending the
completion of an investigation into the allegations in the complaints by the
shareholder derivative claim review committee of the companys board of
directors the lead plaintiffs filed an opposition to this motion on october 2
2001 a hearing on the motion has not yet been scheduled

               two purported shareholder derivative lawsuits also have been
filed in the united states district court for the middle district of tennessee

attorneys fees payable to the plaintiffs counsel of approximately 248
million which has not been accrued in the companys financial statements

               the company believes that it has substantial defenses to the
purported class action and the derivative lawsuits and intends to assert these
defenses in the courts in which the actions are pending in the event the
settlement agreements referred to above do not successfully resolve these
matters these cases are at an early stage and the amount of potential loss if
any should the settlement agreements not become effective cannot be reasonably
estimated an unfavorable outcome for the company in these actions could have a
material adverse impact on the companys financial position and results of
operations

investigation into the circumstances that gave rise to the companys april 30

believes that they have not had and will not have a material adverse effect on
the companys results of operations or financial position

               results of operations

general

               accounting periods the following text contains references to
years 2001 2000 1999 and 1998 which represent fiscal years ending or ended
february 1 2002 february 2 2001 january 28 2000 and january 29 1999
respectively there were 53 weeks in the fiscal year ended february 2 2001
there were 52 weeks in the fiscal years ended january 28 2000 and january 29
1999 there will be 52 weeks in the fiscal year ended february 1 2002 this
discussion and analysis should be read with and is qualified in its entirety
by the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto

               overview of 2000 during 2000 dollar general increased its net
sales by 170 primarily as a result of its continued rapid pace of new store
openings from 1998 through 2000 the company had a compound annual net sales
growth rate of 189 samestore sales increased 09 in 2000 as compared with
increases of 64 and 83 in 1999 and 1998 respectively

               as discussed further below management believes that the
companys operating performance in 2000 was negatively impacted by outofstock
conditions resulting from an extensive systemwide store retrofit program and
changes in the store merchandise ordering process in addition the companys
performance may have been impacted by changes in general economic conditions

               the year 2000 marked the thirteenth consecutive year that the
company increased its total number of store units the company opened 758 new
stores in 2000 compared with 646 in 1999 and 551 in 1998 and remodeled or
relocated 237 stores compared with 409 in 1999 and 351 in 1998 during the last
three years the company has opened remodeled or relocated 2952 stores
accounting for approximately 60 of the total stores as of february 2 2001 the
company ended fiscal 2000 with 5000 stores the company currently plans to open
approximately 600 new stores and close 50 to 60 stores in 2001 and to remodel
or relocate approximately 70 stores the company will continue to focus on
opening new stores in towns with populations of 20000 or fewer and within 250
miles of its dcs the company expects its new stores to be subject to operating
lease arrangements capital expenditures related to new store openings will be
financed through a combination of operating cash flow and credit facilities

               in 2000 new stores remodels and relocations net of 52 closed
stores added an aggregate of approximately 5 million selling square feet to the
companys total sales space as a result the company had an aggregate of
approximately 34 million selling square feet at the end of the year the average
new store opened in 2000 had approximately 6900 selling square feet compared to


                                       19
page

approximately 7200 selling square feet for new stores opened in 1999

               in 1998 the company introduced a preferred development program
to support continued new store growth this program enabled the company to
partner with development firms to build stores in markets where existing
acceptable retail space was not available the company opened 163 new stores
through this program in 2000 compared with 141 new stores in 1999 and 52 new
stores in 1998 in 2001 as the company expands into new markets management
expects to meet store growth needs primarily through conventional leases

               in the third quarter of 2000 the company opened a new dc with
dual sortation capacity in alachua florida and closed a dc in homerville
georgia the company also closed a dc in villa rica georgia that had been
dedicated to supplying new stores and prepared the existing dcs to support new
store growth in 2001 in 2000 the company implemented a new inventory
management system and focused on improving inventory processes in all dcs this
allowed the company to increase its dc inventory turns from 11 in 1999 to 14 in
2000 a 27 increase continuing to support the growing store base and in an
effort to improve distribution efficiencies the company opened its seventh dc
in zanesville ohio in april of 2001

               store investment and infrastructure upgrades were priorities in
2000 new flatbed scanners were installed in all stores and new ibm registers
and checkouts were installed in approximately 2600 stores by the end of 2001
management expects to have the systems to support perpetual inventories in
approximately 4800 stores and expects to establish perpetual inventories in
approximately 500 stores management expects to have the systems to support
perpetual inventories in all stores by the end of 2002 a perpetual inventory
allows the company to track store level inventory at the sku level which should
result in better inventory management additionally management expects to
enhance store communications and improve customer service by installing
satellite communications technology in 2500 stores in 2001 and in all stores
by the end of 2002

restatement of financial statements

               on april 30 2001 the company announced that it had become aware
of certain accounting issues that would cause it to restate its audited
financial statements for fiscal years 1999 and 1998 and to restate the
unaudited financial information for the fiscal year 2000 that had been
previously released by the company the audit committee of the board of
directors promptly assumed oversight of the companys response to the accounting
issues and commenced an independent review of these accounting issues to prepare
the committee for its role in reviewing the restated financial statements
assisted by the law firm of dechert price and rhoads and the independent
accounting firm arthur andersen llp the company further announced on june 7
2001 that its chairman and chief executive officer had directed the companys

                                       20
page

financial staff and its outside professional consultants to review the companys
reporting record keeping accounting and internal control policies and
practices and that until such review had been concluded the company would not
be in a position to update its prior financial guidance the companys financial
staff conducted its review of these issues with the assistance of the companys
outside counsel debevoise  plimpton and accounting consultants from kpmg llp

               consistent with the activities of the audit committee and the
companys review of its financial statements for the 1998 1999 and 2000 fiscal
years the company is restating by means of this filing its audited financial
statements for fiscal years 1999 and 1998 and is filing herewith its audited
financial results for fiscal year 2000 which restate the unaudited financial
information for the fiscal year 2000 that had been previously released by the
company the companys previously released financial data should not be relied
upon

               restated net income and diluted earnings per share for 2000 are
706 million and 021 respectively as compared to the 2060 million and
062 previously reported the restated results for 2000 include a pretax
expense of 1620 million to settle the companys restatementrelated litigation
described below excluding the litigation settlement expense restated net
income and diluted earnings per share for 2000 are 1696 million and 051
respectively restated net income totaled 1867 million in fiscal 1999 and
1509 million in fiscal 1998 equaling diluted earnings per share of 055 and
045 respectively the company originally reported prior to the restatement
net income of 2194 million in fiscal 1999 and 1820 million in fiscal 1998
equaling diluted earnings per share for those periods of 065 and 054
respectively

               the issues for restatement excluding the litigation settlement
expense can be broken down into four general categories i items impacting
the cost of goods sold that were recorded incorrectly andor that reflect more
accurate estimates ii selling general and administrative sga expenses
that were either incurred but not accrued or recorded incorrectly iii
additional interest expense required as a result of restating certain operating
leases as capital leases and financing obligations and the addition of capital
lease and financing obligation liabilities to the companys balance sheets and
iv changes to the companys income tax provision to correct errors

               set forth below is a more detailed description of the four
general categories of issues identified and corrected and the earnings per share
impact of such items over the threeyear period of 2000 1999 and 1998

               cost of goods sold the company has reduced its diluted earnings
per share by 005 over the threeyear period to correct items impacting the
cost of goods sold that were recorded incorrectly andor that reflect more
accurate estimates examples of items that fall into this category include the

                                       21
page

provision for inventory shrinkage certain expenses associated with the
companys import program the markdown to facilitate the sale of excess
inventory certain vendor allowances for new store openings the accounting
treatment of markdowns to remove damaged merchandise from stock and a provision
for uncollectible vendor charge backs the item with the largest impact on the
restatement affecting cost of goods sold is the recalculation of the shrinkage
provision which reduced diluted earnings per share by 004 over the threeyear
restatement period the restatement of cost of goods sold reduced diluted
earnings per share by 001 001 and 003 in 2000 1999 and 1998
respectively


               selling general  administrative expenses the company has
reduced its diluted earnings per share by 011 over the threeyear period to
record correctly expenses that were either incurred but not accrued or recorded
incorrectly prior to this restatement the company recorded certain expenses
when it processed payment as opposed to when the activity was actually
undertaken expense items that fall into this category reduced diluted earnings
per share by 002 over the threeyear period and include among other items
property taxes rent supplies trash removal advertising costs maintenance
costs and utilities a partial list of expenses that were recorded incorrectly
includes the depreciation expense on certain older cash registers the rent and
depreciation expense associated with certain leases restated from operating
lease classification to capital lease classification certain store labor costs
and supplies that were capitalized when they should have been expensed the
impairment of a closed distribution center compensation expense related to the
use of stock options for excess tax withholding and various expenses that were
charged against unrelated liability accounts as opposed to being categorized as
sga expenses the restatement of sga expenses reduced diluted earnings per
share by 002 005 and 004 in 2000 1999 and 1998 respectively


               interest expense the company has reduced its diluted earnings
per share by 011 over the threeyear period to correctly record additional
interest expense required as a result of restating certain operating leases as
capital leases or as financing obligations as part of the restatement process
the company examined its accounting practices with regard to certain synthetic
lease facilities entered into in 1997 and 1999 with respect to its use and
occupancy of certain real property including approximately 400 stores two of
the companys distribution centers and the companys corporate headquarters in
goodlettsville tennessee the company determined that the synthetic leases did
not meet the statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 13
requirements for operating lease treatment due primarily to the current
assumption that the company would incur a penalty as defined in sfas no 98 if
it did not renew the leases additionally the company identified four
saleleaseback transactions that were incorrectly classified exclusively as
operating leases two of these transactions have now been recorded as financing
obligations while the equipment portion of the other two transactions have been
accounted for as capital leases increases in interest expense as a result of
the various lease


                                       22

classification changes reduced diluted earnings per share by 006 004 and
001 in 2000 1999 and 1998 respectively as of february 2 2001 january 28
2000 and january 29 1999 the company added various longterm obligations to
its consolidated balance sheets of 5110 million 5138 million and 1757
million respectively

               tax provision the company has reduced its diluted earnings per
share by 002 over the threeyear period to correct errors in the companys tax
provision the companys effective tax rate before the restatement was 362 in
2000 362 in 1999 and 352 in 1998 the companys effective tax rate on a
restated basis excluding the impact of the litigation settlement expense is
373 in 2000 367 in 1999 and 369 in 1998 issues contributing to the
increase in the effective tax rate include a change in the calculation of the
companys deferred tax liability from a consolidated calculation to a
calculation by individual entity in accordance with sfas no 109 a change in
the computation of the income tax benefit allocated to additional paidin
capital related to the exercise of nonqualified stock options the correction
of a duplicate deduction related to inventory on a prior income tax return the
correction of the companys current income tax liability which had been
improperly reduced for amounts paid relating to professional fees interest and
certain penalties and increases to income taxrelated accrued liabilities the
restatement of the companys income tax provision reduced diluted earnings per
share excluding the impact of the litigation settlement expense by 001 in
2000 and 001 in 1998 a tax rate of 389 was applied in 2000 against the
1620 million litigation settlement expense including the impact of the
litigation settlement expense the restated effective tax rate in 2000 was
350

               in addition to the restatement of diluted earnings per share the
correction of many of these issues also required an adjustment to previously
reported balance sheets please refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial
statements for a schedule reconciling the various restatementrelated
adjustments with previously released data for 2000 1999 and 1998

critical accounting policies

               as discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined using
the retail lastin firstout lifo method under the retail inventory method
rim the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins
are calculated by applying a calculated costto retail ratio to the retail value
of inventories rim is an averaging method that has been widely used in the
retail industry due to its practicality also it is recognized that the use of
the retail inventory method will result in valuing inventories at lower of cost
or market if markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of
inventories


                                       23
page



               inherent in the rim calculation are certain significant
management judgments and estimates including among others merchandise markon
markups markdowns and shrinkage which significantly impact the ending
inventory valuation at cost as well as resulting gross margins these
significant estimates coupled with the fact that the rim is an averaging
process can under certain circumstances produce distorted or inaccurate cost
figures factors that can lead to distortion in the calculation of the inventory
balance include applying the rim to a group of products that is not fairly
uniform in terms of its cost and selling price relationship and turnover and
applying rim to transactions over a period of time that includes different rates
of gross profit such as those relating to seasonal merchandise to reduce the
potential of such distortions in the valuation of inventory from occurring the
companys rim utilizes 10 departments in which fairly homogenous classes of
merchandise inventories having similar gross margins are grouped in addition
failure to take markdowns currently can result in an overstatement of cost under
the lower of cost or market principle during fiscal 2000 the company recorded
markdowns that had not been taken and which served to reduce inventories to
lower of cost or market by approximately 215 million

               management believes that the companys rim provides an inventory
valuation which reasonably approximates cost and results in carrying inventory
at the lower of cost or market

results of operations

               the following discussion of the companys financial performance
is based on the consolidated financial statements set forth herein

               net sales net sales totaled 455 billion for 2000 389
billion for 1999 and 322 billion for 1998 representing annual increases of
170 in 2000 207 in 1999 and 226 in 1998 the increases resulted primarily
from 706 net new stores and a samestore sales increase of 09 in 2000 607 net
new stores and a samestore sales increase of 64 in 1999 and 518 net new
stores and a samestore sales increase of 83 in 1998

               the company believes that the lower same store sales increase in
2000 was due primarily to the disruptive effect of a comprehensive store reset
program designed to improve the product mix and appearance of its stores which
affected the vast majority of the store base this program which commenced in
may and concluded in august of 2000 involved adding items in faster turning
categories such as food paper products and health and beauty aids and reducing
the number of skus in the apparel and home products categories in addition to
these changes in the product mix the reset involved moving center island
fixtures and relocating within the store much of the existing inventory the
reset program also included widening store aisles in an effort to make the
shopping experience more convenient for customers the company believes this

                                       24
page

program will ultimately lead to an improvement in sales per square foot the
implementation of the reset program however strained store labor resources and
disrupted operations during the affected period this disruption resulted in
sporadic outofstock conditions mostly in ancillary items such as mops and
brooms pet supplies trash bags and domestics from may 2000 through december
2000

               other factors that may have had an impact on the lower same store
sales increase in 2000 include a change in store ordering procedures from a
manual process to a new automated system relying on the scanning of shelf tags
which may have been an additional cause of the sporadic outofstock conditions
experienced by the company and a general softening of economic conditions

               the relatively strong same store sales increases in 1999 and 1998
were due primarily to the companys ongoing shift in emphasis to the consumable
basics segment of its business

               the company tracks its sales internally by four divisions highly
consumable hardware and seasonal basic clothing and home products total
sales in the highly consumable department increased by 261 464 and 239
in 2000 1999 and 1998 respectively total sales in the hardware and seasonal
department increased by 102 60 and 211 in 2000 1999 and 1998
respectively total sales in the basic clothing department increased by 149
232 and 263 in 2000 1999 and 1998 respectively total sales in the home
products department experienced annual changes of 05 107 and 200 in
2000 1999 and 1998 respectively

               gross profit gross profit for 2000 was 125 billion or 275
of sales compared with 109 billion or 281 of sales in 1999 and 089
billion or 277 of sales in 1998 the decline in the gross profit rate in
2000 as compared to 1999 was due primarily to the 215 million effect of a
markdown recorded in 2000 as described in note 4 to the consolidated financial
statements see item 8 the company believes that it has certain excess
inventories that will require a markdown to assist with its disposition the
company believes that this markdown will be adequate to ensure the sale of the
excess inventory during fiscal years 2001 and 2002 however there can be no
assurance that the company will be able to sell all of this inventory by the end
of 2002 without marking down the inventory at issue in amounts exceeding the
markdown recorded to date

               the increase in the gross profit rate in 1999 as compared to 1998
is due primarily to a 62 basis point increase in the initial margin recognized
on inventory purchases resulting in part from an increase in 1999 in the
purchase of higher margin private label items and price brands and a
reduction in 1999 in the purchase of lower margin basic clothing items


                                       25

               inventory shrinkage calculated at the retail value of the
inventory as a percentage of sales was 280 in 2000 262 in 1999 and 259
in 1998 the companys goal is to maintain a shrink rate in the range of 175
to 200 in 2001 the company appointed approximately 25 financial control
specialists to assist its stores with various shrinkage reduction efforts these
financial control specialists are focusing on activities such as investigating
missing cash deposits and evaluating the processes in stores with consistently
poor shrinkage results

               distribution and transportation costs increased by 16 basis
points as a percentage of sales in 2000 as compared to 1999 and increased by 5
basis points in 1999 as compared to 1998 the increase in distribution and
transportation costs as a percentage of sales is due in part to the additional
fixed costs associated with the fulton and alachua distribution centers which
were opened in 1999 and 2000 respectively

               selling general and administrative expense total sga expense
as a percentage of net sales was 205 in 2000 compared with 199 in 1999 and
199 in 1998 sga expense for 2000 was 9349 million an increase of 210
compared to 1999 sga expense in 1999 was 7729 million an increase of 209
over the 1998 total of 6395 million

               the 66 basis point increase in sga expense as a percentage of
net sales experienced in 2000 was due in part to the fact that store labor
store depreciation and amortization and store utilities experienced annual
increases of 229 444 and 278 respectively which were all in excess of
the companys sales increase of 170 the increase in store labor as a
percentage of sales was due principally to the additional hours required to
complete the store reset program and the general weakness of same store sales
the increase in store depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of
sales was a result of the number of new stores subject to capital leases

               litigation settlement expense the company recorded 1620
million in 2000 for the proposed settlement of the restatementrelated
litigation see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements

               interest expense in 2000 interest expense was 454 million
compared with 259 million in 1999 and 140 million in 1998 the increase in
interest expense in 2000 resulted from the net addition of 2136 million in
various longterm obligations during 2000

               the average daily total debt outstanding in 2000 was 7103
million at an average interest rate of 72 the increase in interest expense in
1999 resulted from the addition in 1999 of 2938 million in various longterm
obligations the average daily total debt outstanding in 1999 was 4540 million
at an average interest rate of 60 the average total debt outstanding in 1998
was 2538 million at an average interest rate of 58

               provision for taxes on income the effective income tax rates for
2000 1999 and 1998 were 350 367 and 369 respectively the reduction in
the effective tax rate in 2000 was due to the 389 marginal tax rate applied
against the litigation settlement expense excluding the tax impact of the
litigation settlement expense the effective tax rate in 2000 was 373

fulton missouri were purchased from the facilities and sold in saleleaseback
transactions resulting in twentytwo year triple net leases with renewal
options for an additional thirty years these were refinanced to bolster
liquidity and diversify sources of funds

for fiscal 1998 cash flow from operations for fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal
1999 increased by 188 million due principally to a reduction in the amount of

2000 versus 1390 million in 1999 and 1432 million in 1998 capital

companyowned stores capital expenditures for new relocated and remodeled
stores totaled 580 million during 1998

               distributionrelated capital expenditures totaled 493 million
in 2000 resulting primarily from costs associated with the new dcs in alachua

totaled 432 million resulting primarily from costs associated with the
expansion of the ardmore oklahoma dc and the purchase of new delivery trailers
in 1998 the company spent 463 million resulting primarily from costs

balances cash flow from operations and its ongoing access to the capital
markets will provide sufficient financing to meet these obligations as well as
the companys other foreseeable liquidity and capital resource needs however
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain financing in
the amounts that it requires or that the terms of such financing will be as
attractive as the terms on which the company has obtained financing in the past

forward looking  statements  risk factors

               this discussion and analysis contains historical and
forwardlooking information the forwardlooking statements are made pursuant to
the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of
1995 the company believes the assumptions underlying these forwardlooking
statements are reasonable however any of the assumptions could be inaccurate
and therefore actual results may differ materially from those projected in the
forwardlooking statements as a result of certain risks and uncertainties these
risks include but are not limited to the following

               the companys reputation and financial condition could be
affected by the restatement on april 30 2001 the company announced that it
had become aware of certain accounting issues that would cause it to restate its
audited financial statements for fiscal years 1998 and 1999 and to revise the
unaudited financial information for the fiscal year 2000 that had been
previously released by the company following this announcement more than 20
purported class action lawsuits have been filed against the company and certain
current and former officers and directors of the company asserting claims under
the federal securities laws these lawsuits have been consolidated into a single
action pending in the united states district court for the middle district of
tennessee in addition six purported shareholder derivative lawsuits have been
filed in tennessee state court against certain current and

former company directors and officers and deloitte  touche llp the companys
former independent accountant and two purported shareholder derivative lawsuits
have been filed in the united states district court for the middle district of
tennessee against certain current and former company directors and officers
alleging that they breached their fiduciary duties to the company the company
has also been notified that the sec is conducting an investigation into the
circumstances that gave rise to the companys april 30 2001 announcement

               as discussed above the company has entered into settlement
agreements with the purported class action plaintiffs and with the lead counsel
in the lead shareholders derivative action however such settlement agreements
are subject to conditions including the completion of confirmatory due
diligence and court approval in the event that these settlement agreements do
not become effective the company will incur additional significant expenditures
in defending itself and the company may be exposed to financial losses in excess
of the amounts that the company has agreed to pay in the settlement agreements
in addition the publicity surrounding the litigation and the sec investigation
could affect the companys reputation and have an impact on its financial
condition

               the companys business is modestly seasonal with the highest
sales occurring during the fourth quarter and adverse events during the fourth
quarter could therefore affect the companys financial condition the company
realizes a large portion of its net sales and net income during the christmas
selling season in anticipation of the holidays the company purchases
substantial amounts of seasonal inventory and hires many temporary employees if
for any reason the companys net sales during the christmas selling season were
to fall below seasonal norms a seasonal merchandise inventory imbalance could
result if such an imbalance were to occur markdowns might be required to
minimize this imbalance the companys profitability and operating results could
be adversely affected by unbudgeted markdowns

               adverse weather conditions or other disruptions during the peak
christmas season could also affect the companys net sales and could make it
more difficult for the company to obtain sufficient quantities of merchandise
from its suppliers

               competition in the retail industry could limit the companys
growth opportunities and reduce its profitability the company competes in the
discount retail merchandise business which is highly competitive this
competitive environment subjects the company to the risk of reduced
profitability resulting from reduced margins required to maintain the companys
competitive position the company competes with discount stores and with many
other retailers including mass merchandise grocery drug convenience variety
and other specialty stores some of the nations largest retail companies
operate stores in areas where the company operates the companys direct
competitors in the dollar store retail category include family dollar dollar
tree freds and various local independent operators competitors from other


                                       32

retail categories include cvs rite aid walgreens eckerds walmart and kmart
the discount retail merchandise business is subject to excess capacity and some
of the companys competitors are much larger and have substantially greater
resources than the company the competition for customers has intensified in
recent years as larger competitors such as walmart and kmart have moved into
the companys geographic markets the company remains vulnerable to the
marketing power and high level of consumer recognition of these major national
discount chains the company expects a further increase in competition from
these national discount retailers

               the companys financial performance is sensitive to changes in
overall economic conditions that may impact consumer spending the general
slowdown in the united states economy may adversely affect the spending of the
companys consumers which would likely result in lower net sales than expected
on a quarterly or annual basis future economic conditions affecting disposable
consumer income such as employment levels business conditions fuel and energy
costs interest rates and tax rates could also adversely affect the companys
business by reducing consumer spending or causing consumers to shift their
spending to other products

               the companys business is dependent on its vendors the company
believes that it has generally good relations with its vendors and that it is
generally able to obtain attractive pricing and other terms from vendors if the
company fails to maintain good relations with its vendors it may not be able to
obtain attractive pricing with the consequence that its net sales or profit
margins would be reduced the company may also face difficulty in obtaining
needed inventory from its vendors because of interruptions in production or for
other reasons which would adversely affect the companys business

               the efficient operation of the companys business is heavily
dependent on its information systems as part of its technology update the
company installed new flatbed scanners in all its stores and is in the process
of installing new ibm registers and checkouts the company depends on a variety
of other information technology systems for the efficient functioning of its
business the company relies on certain software vendors to maintain and
periodically upgrade many of these systems so that they can continue to support
the companys business the software programs supporting many of the companys
systems were licensed to the company by independent software developers the
inability of these developers to continue to maintain and upgrade these
information systems and software programs would disrupt or reduce the efficiency
of the companys operations if it were unable to convert to alternate systems in
an efficient and timely manner

               the company is subject to interest rate risk the company is
subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on its
financing investing and cash management activities the company utilizes a

credit facility to fund working capital requirements which is comprised of
variable rate debt see item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures
about market risk

               the company is dependent upon the smooth functioning of its
distribution network the company relies upon the ability to replenish depleted
inventory through deliveries to its distribution centers from vendors and from
the distribution centers to its stores by various means of transportation
including shipments by air sea and truck on the roads and highways of the
united states longterm disruptions to the national and international
transportation infrastructure that lead to delays or interruptions of service
will adversely affect the companys business

               the company is dependent on the continued availability of capital
to support its business as discussed above in september 2002 the companys
synthetic leases in the amount of 383 million will mature and the companys
175 million revolving credit facility will expire the company may also have to

litigation discussed above in an amount of up to 162 million in addition the
company will continue to need capital to support its plans for future growth a
decline in the companys generation of cash flow or the inability of the company

obligations the downgrade in the companys credit ratings may affect the
companys ability to obtain financing in the future and will also affect the
terms of any such financing

company will have to comply with the registration requirements of the securities
and exchange commission including among other things the requirement that the
company disclose selected financial information for a period of five fiscal
years this may require the company to restate its financial statements for
periods prior to the 1998 fiscal year unless and until it is able to do so the

will be limited to nonpublic sources of financing which may result in

item 7a       quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

financial risk management

               the company is exposed to market risk primarily from adverse
changes in interest rates to minimize such risk the company may periodically
use financial instruments including derivatives as a matter of policy the
company does not buy or sell financial instruments for speculative or trading
purposes and all financial instrument transactions must be authorized and
executed pursuant to board of directors approval all financial instrument
positions taken by the company are used to reduce risk by hedging an underlying
economic exposure because of high correlation between the financial instrument
and the underlying exposure being hedged fluctuations in the value of the
financial instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the value of
the underlying economic exposure the financial instruments used by the company
are straightforward instruments with liquid markets

               the company has cash flow exposure relating to variable interest
rates primarily associated with revolving and seasonal lines of credit and
certain lease obligations and seeks to manage this risk through the use of
interest rate swaps the primary interest rate exposure on variable rate
obligations is based on the london interbank offered rate libor

               at february 2 2001 and january 28 2000 the fair value of the
companys debt excluding capital lease obligations was estimated at
approximately 2959 million and 877 million respectively based on the
estimated market value of the debt at those dates such fair value is less than
the carrying value of the debt at february 2 2001 and january 28 2000 by
approximately 07 million and 104 million respectively

               at february 2 2001 the company was party to an interest rate
swap agreement with a notional amount of 100 million the company designated
this agreement as a hedge of floating rate commitments relating to its synthetic
lease agreements under the terms of the agreement the company will pay a fixed
rate of 560 on the 100 million notional amount through september 1 2002 the
fair value of the interest rate swap agreement was 04 million at february 2
2001 the counterparty to the companys interest rate swap agreement was a major
financial institution the company is exposed to credit risk in the event of
nonperformance by such counterparty the amount of which exposure is limited to


                                       35
page

the unpaid portion of amounts due to the company pursuant to the interest rate
swap agreement if any although there are no collateral requirements if a
downgrade in the credit rating of the counterparty occurs the company believes
that its exposure is mitigated by provisions in the interest rate swap agreement
that allow the company to offset any amounts payable by the company to the
counterparty with any amounts due to the company from the counterparty

               at january 28 2000 the company was party to two interest rate
swap agreements with notional amounts totaling 200 million these agreements
fixed the companys floating rate commitments relating to a portion of its
synthetic lease agreements under the terms of these agreements the company
paid a weighted average fixed rate of 514 on the 200 million notional amount
during fiscal years 1999 and 2000 the fair value of these agreements at january
28 2000 was 31 million as of that date the maturity date for both
agreements was expected to occur in september 2002 in january 2001 the company
paid 02 million to terminate one of those interest rate swap agreements

               in both 1999 and 2000 the company recognized any differences
paid or received on interest rate swap agreements as adjustments to interest
expense

               based upon the companys variable rate borrowing levels a 1
change in interest rates would have resulted in a pretax fluctuation of
approximately 16 million and 26 million including the effects of interest
rate swaps in 1999 and 2000 respectively in 2001 the company does not
anticipate this expense fluctuation to vary materially from the estimated impact
in 2000
