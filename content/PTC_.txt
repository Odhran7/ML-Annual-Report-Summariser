our strategy 

there are three key elements to our strategy to deliver longterm shareholder value 

accelerate digital thread solutions 

with our solutions we enable companies to adopt a “digital thread” strategy to drive innovation and productivity a digital thread manages product data and makes it accessible and useful to the right people at the right time and in the right context this is particularly relevant for larger businesses pursuing a vertically integrated manufacturing strategy in which the reuse and repurposing of earlier innovations drives next generation product offerings 

accelerate product innovation 

we enable companies to upend the product development process with solutions that apply agile concepts originally focused on software development to the entire product innovation process from software to hardware and electronics by applying agile product development processes across all three disciplines companies can increase innovation velocity and bring new products to market faster to meet rapidly changing market demand this is particularly relevant for startup and upstart businesses focused on technologycentered innovations that commonly leverage contract manufacturers for production of their designs 

accelerate saas transformation 

manufacturers today face a myriad of business challenges macroeconomic forces such as an everevolving workforce supply chain disruptions the rise of smart connected products and the need to prove sustainability are all driving the need for change we enable companies to respond to these challenges with technology that leverages the cloud to transform how where and when work gets done softwareasaservice saas which has already reshaped nearly all aspects of business is poised to transform management of the entire product lifecycle anticipating this need ptc acquired the onshape and arena cloudnative product development solutions in parallel we are heavily investing to transform our technology portfolio to saas 

strategic transactions 

during fy22 we completed two strategic transactions in q322 we acquired the codebeamer tm application lifecycle management business to broaden and deepen our alm footprint across safetycritical and regulated industries in q322 we also sold a portion of our plm services business to itc infotech the transaction is designed to accelerate customer digital transformation initiatives and adoption of our windchill saas solution refer to note 6 acquisitions and disposition of business of notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report for additional discussion regarding these transactions 

our principal products and services 

in 2022 we reported our business in two product groups digital thread and velocity digital thread included products focused on customers that are embracing enterprisewide digital transformation and velocity included products focused on customers that prioritize agile product development beginning in fiscal year 2023 we are reporting our businesses in two new product groups cad computeraided design and plm product lifecycle management products designated as cad refer to software used for product data authoring products designated as plm refer to software used for product data management and process orchestration 

the new reporting structure aligns better to our strategy product offerings and industry segments 

 

  

to meet the increasing demand for saas delivered solutions we expect to introduce a number of new saas offerings over time these service offerings will provide an alternative to our traditional onpremises software products and provide our customers with the benefits of saas including accelerated time to value reduced complexity lower costs to implement upgrade and administer improved user collaboration and mobility and scalability we are giving this new generation of offerings a “plus” brand we launched windchill in the second quarter of 2022 

our markets and how we address them 

the markets we serve present different growth opportunities for us we see opportunity for further market growth for all our solutions with a new generation of saas solutions we are developing to bring to market over the next few years 

we derive most of our sales from products and services sold directly by our sales force to enduser customers approximately 25 to 30 of our sales of products and services are through thirdparty resellers our sales force focuses on large accounts while our reseller channel provides a costeffective means of covering the small and mediumsize business market our strategic alliance partners enable us to increase our market reach offer broader solutions and add compelling technology to our offerings our strategic services partners provide service offerings to help customers implement our product offerings and transition to saas

 item 1a ri sk factors 

the following are important factors we have identified that could affect an investment in our securities you should consider them carefully when evaluating an investment in ptc securities because these factors could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or any forwardlooking statements the risks described below are not the only risks we face additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business financial condition andor operating results 

i risks related to our business operations and industry 

we face significant competition which may reduce our profitability and limit or reduce our market share 

the markets for our products and solutions are rapidly changing and characterized by intense competition disruptive technology developments evolving distribution models and increasingly lower barriers to entry if we are unable to provide products and solutions that address customers’ needs as well as our competitors’ products and solutions do or to align our pricing licensing and delivery models with customer preferences we could lose customers andor fail to attract new customers which could cause us to lose revenue and market share 

for example the covid19 pandemic caused companies worldwide to close their offices and their employees to have to work remotely from their homes and there remains uncertainty about the extent to which employees will return to the office in the long term this has focused companies on the need for solutions that empower and support remote work by employees we believe customers and potential customers will increasingly seek software solutions that support remote work by employees although many of our solutions support remote work others are less efficient at doing so we have embarked on an effort to make our solutions available on a saas platform however this will require significant effort and investment and we cannot be sure that we will be able to make our solutions available as saas solutions as quickly as we expect or that customers will adopt them as we expect if we are unable to compete successfully with competitors offering saas solutions we could lose customers andor fail to attract new customers which could cause us to lose revenue and market share which would adversely affect our business and financial results 

in addition competitive pressures could cause us to reduce our prices which could reduce our revenue and margins 

our current and potential competitors range from large and wellestablished companies to emerging startups some of our competitors and potential competitors have greater name recognition in the markets we serve and greater financial technical sales and marketing and other resources which could limit our ability to gain customer recognition and confidence in our products and solutions and successfully sell our products and solutions which could adversely affect our ability to grow our business 

a breach of security in our products or computer systems or those of our thirdparty service providers could compromise the integrity of our products cause loss of data harm our reputation create additional liability and adversely impact our financial results 

we have implemented and continue to implement measures intended to maintain the security and integrity of our products source code and it systems the potential for a security breach or system disruption has significantly increased over time as the scope number intensity and sophistication of attempted cyberattacks and cyber intrusions have increased – particularly cyberattacks and intrusions designed to access and exfiltrate information and to disrupt and lockup access to systems for the purpose of demanding a ransom payment it is impossible for us to eliminate the risk of a successful cyberattack or intrusion and in fact we deal with security issues on a regular basis and have experienced security incidents from time to time accordingly there is a risk that a cyberattack or intrusion will be successful and that such event will be material 

in addition we offer cloud services to our customers and some of our products including our saas products are hosted by thirdparty service providers which expose us to additional risks as those repositories of our customers’ proprietary data may be targeted and a cyberattack or intrusion may be successful and material interception of data transmission misappropriation or modification of data corruption of data and attacks against our service providers may adversely affect our products or product and service delivery malicious code viruses or vulnerabilities that are undetected by our service providers may disrupt our business operations generally and may have a disproportionate effect on those of our products that are developed and delivered in the cloud environment 

while we devote resources to maintaining the security and integrity of our products and systems as well as performing due diligence of our thirdparty service providers security breaches that have not had a material effect on our business or that of our customers have occurred and we will continue to face cybersecurity threats and exposure a significant breach of the security andor integrity of our products or systems or those of our thirdparty service providers whether or intentional or by human error by our employees or others could disrupt our business operations or those of our customers could prevent our products from functioning properly could enable access to sensitive proprietary or confidential information of our customers or could enable access to our sensitive proprietary or confidential information this could require us to incur significant costs of investigation remediation andor payment of a ransom harm our reputation cause customers to stop buying our products and cause us to face lawsuits and potential liability any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we increasingly rely on thirdparty providers of cloud infrastructure services to deliver our offerings to users on our platform and any disruption of or interference with our use of these services could adversely affect our business 

our continued growth depends in part on the ability of our existing and potential customers to use and access our cloud services or our website in order to download our software or encrypted access keys for our software within an acceptable amount of time we use a number of thirdparty service providers that we do not control for key components of our infrastructure particularly with respect to development and delivery of our cloudbased products the use of these service providers gives us greater flexibility in efficiently delivering a more tailored scalable customer experience but also exposes us to additional risks and vulnerabilities thirdparty service providers operate their own platforms that we access and we are therefore vulnerable to their service interruptions we may experience interruptions delays and outages in service and availability from time to time as a result of problems with our thirdparty service providers’ infrastructure lack of availability of this infrastructure could be due to a number of potential causes including technical failures natural disasters fraud or security attacks that we cannot predict or prevent such outages could trigger our service level agreements with customers and require us to issue the issuance of credits to our cloudbased product customers which could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we are unable to renew our agreements with our cloud service providers on commercially reasonable terms or any of our agreements are prematurely terminated or we need to add new cloud services providers to increase capacity and uptime we could experience interruptions downtime delays and additional expenses related to transferring to and providing support for these new platforms any of the above circumstances or events may harm our reputation and brand reduce the availability or usage of our platforms and impair our ability to attract new users any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may be unable to hire or retain personnel with the necessary skills to operate and grow our business which could adversely affect our ability to compete 

our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial sales and marketing technical financial and administrative personnel to operate and grow our business competition for such personnel in our industry is intense particularly in the boston massachusetts area where our global headquarters is located 

the technical personnel required to develop our products and solutions are in high demand if we are unable to attract and retain technical personnel with the requisite skills our product and solution development efforts could be delayed which could adversely affect our ability to compete and thereby adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

the managerial sales and marketing financial and administrative personnel necessary to guide our operations market and sell our solutions and support our business operations are also in high demand due to intense competition in our industry 

if we are unable to attract and retain the personnel we need to develop compelling products and solutions and guide operate and support our business we may be unable to successfully compete which would adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we depend on sales within the discrete manufacturing sector and our business could be adversely affected if manufacturing activity does not grow or if it contracts or if manufacturers are adversely affected by other macroeconomic factors 

a large amount of our sales are to customers in the discrete manufacturing sector manufacturers worldwide continue to face uncertainty about the global macroeconomic environment due to among other factors the effects of earlier and ongoing supply chain disruptions rising interest rates and inflation volatile foreign exchange rates and the current relative strength of the us dollar the effects of the russia—ukraine conflict including on the supply of energy resources in europe and the us government’s focus on technology transactions with nonus entities in light of these challenges and concerns customers may delay reduce or forego purchases of our solutions which would adversely affect our business and financial results 

if we fail to successfully manage our transition to a saas company our business and financial results could be adversely affected 

becoming a saas company requires considerable additional investment in our organization whether our transition will be successful and will accomplish our business and financial objectives is subject to uncertainties including but not limited to customer demand attach and renewal rates channel adoption our ability to further develop and scale infrastructure our ability to include functionality and usability in such offerings that address customer requirements and our costs if we are unable to successfully establish these new offerings and navigate our business transition due to these risks and uncertainties our business and financial results could be adversely impacted 

because our sales and operations are globally dispersed we face additional compliance risks and any compliance failure could adversely affect our business and financial results 

we sell and deliver software and services and maintain support operations in many countries whose laws and practices differ from one another and are subject to unexpected changes managing these geographically dispersed operations requires significant attention and resources to ensure compliance with laws of those countries and those of the us governing our activities in nonus countries 

those laws include but are not limited to anticorruption laws and regulations including the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and the uk bribery act 2010 data privacy laws and regulations including the european unions general data privacy regulation and trade and economic sanctions laws and regulations including laws administered by the us department of the treasury’s office of foreign assets control the us state department the us department of commerce the united nations security council and other relevant sanctions authorities our compliance risks are heightened due to the gotomarket approach for our business that relies heavily on a partner ecosystem the fact that we operate in countries with a higher incidence of corruption and fraudulent business practices than others the fact that we deal with governments and stateowned business enterprises and the fact that global enforcement of laws has significantly increased 

accordingly while we strive to maintain a comprehensive compliance program an employee agent or business partner may violate our policies or us or other applicable laws or we may inadvertently violate such laws investigations of alleged violations of those laws can be expensive and disruptive violations of such laws can lead to civil andor criminal prosecutions substantial fines and other sanctions including the revocation of our rights to continue certain operations and also cause business loss and reputational harm which could adversely affect our financial results andor stock price 

ii risks related to acquisitions and strategic relationships 

businesses we acquire may not generate the revenue and earnings we anticipate and may otherwise adversely affect our business 

we have acquired and intend to continue to acquire new businesses and technologies if we fail to successfully integrate and manage the businesses and technologies we acquire if an acquisition does not further our business strategy as we expect or if a business we acquire has unexpected legal or financial liabilities our operating results will be adversely affected 

the types of issues that we may face in integrating and operating the acquired business include 

• difficulties managing an acquired company’s technologies or lines of business or entering new markets where we have limited or no prior experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions 

• unanticipated operating difficulties in connection with the acquired entities including potential declines in revenue of the acquired entity 

• complications relating to the assumption of preexisting contractual relationships of an acquired company that we would not have otherwise entered into the termination or modification of which may be costly or disruptive to our business 

• issuing equity awards to or assuming existing equity awards of acquired employees which may more rapidly deplete share reserves available under our shareholderapproved equity incentive plans 

• litigation arising from the transaction including potential intellectual property claims or disputes following our acquisition 

• diversion of management and employee attention 

• challenges with implementing adequate and appropriate controls procedures and policies in an acquired business 

• potential loss of key personnel in connection with an acquisition and 

• potential incompatibility of business cultures 

further if we do not achieve the expected return on our investments it could impair the intangible assets and goodwill that we recorded as part of an acquisition which could require us to record a reduction to the value of those assets 

we may incur significant debt or issue a material amount of debt or equity securities to finance an acquisition which could adversely affect our operating flexibility and financial statements 

if we were to incur a significant amount of debt—whether by borrowing funds under our credit facility or otherwise or issuing new debt securities—to finance an acquisition our interest expense debt service requirements and leverage would increase significantly the increases in these expenses and in our leverage could constrain our ability to operate as we might otherwise or to borrow additional amounts 

if we were to issue a significant amount of equity securities in connection with an acquisition existing stockholders would be diluted and earnings per share could decrease 

our inability to maintain or develop our strategic and technology relationships could adversely affect our business 

we have many strategic and technology relationships with other companies with which we work to offer complementary solutions and services that market and sell our solutions and that provide technologies that we embed in our solutions we may not realize the expected benefits from these relationships and such relationships may be terminated by the other party if these companies fail to perform or if a company terminates or substantially alters the terms of the relationship we could suffer delays in product development reduced sales or other operational difficulties and our business results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

iii risks related to our intellectual property 

we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights which could adversely affect our business and our ability to compete effectively 

our software products are proprietary we protect our intellectual property rights in these items by relying on copyrights trademarks patents and common law safeguards including trade secret protection as well as restrictions on disclosures and transferability contained in our agreements with other parties despite these measures the laws of all relevant jurisdictions may not afford adequate protection to our products and other intellectual property in addition we frequently encounter attempts by individuals and companies to pirate our software if our measures to protect our intellectual property rights fail others may be able to use those rights which could reduce our competitiveness and revenues 

in addition any legal action to protect our intellectual property rights that we may bring or be engaged in could be costly may distract management from daytoday operations and may lead to additional claims against us and we may not succeed all of which would materially adversely affect our operating results 

intellectual property infringement claims could be asserted against us which could be expensive to defend and could result in limitations on our use of the claimed intellectual property 

the software industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding copyright patent and other intellectual property rights if a lawsuit of this type is filed it could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel we cannot be sure that we would prevail against any such asserted claims if we did not prevail we could be prevented from using the claimed intellectual property or be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements which might not be available on terms acceptable to us in addition to possible claims with respect to our proprietary products some of our products contain technology developed by and licensed from third parties and we may likewise be susceptible to infringement claims with respect to these thirdparty technologies 

iv risks related to our indebtedness 

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations as well as our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt 

we have a significant amount of indebtedness as of november 15 2022 our total debt outstanding was approximately 1359 billion 1 billion of which was associated with the 3625 senior notes and 4000 senior notes together “senior notes” issued in february 2020 which mature in february 2025 and 2028 respectively and are unsecured and 359 million of which was borrowed under our credit facility which matures in february 2025 all amounts outstanding under the credit facility and the senior notes will be due and payable in full on their respective maturity dates as of november 15 2022 we had unused commitments under our credit facility of 641 million ptc inc and one of our foreign subsidiaries are eligible borrowers under the credit facility and certain other foreign subsidiaries may become borrowers under our credit facility in the future subject to certain conditions 

specifically our level of debt could 

• make it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations and other ongoing business obligations which may result in defaults 

• result in an event of default if we fail to comply with the financial and other covenants contained in the agreements governing our debt instruments which could result in all of our debt becoming immediately due and payable or require us to negotiate an amendment to financial or other covenants that could cause us to incur additional fees and expenses 

• limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital capital expenditures acquisitions or other general corporate requirements 

• reduce the availability of our cash to fund working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and other general corporate purposes and limit our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes 

• increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions 

• amplify the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings including borrowings under our credit facility are at variable rates of interest 

• limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to and increasing our vulnerability to changes in our business the industries in which we operate and the overall economy and 

• place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to other less leveraged competitors 

any of the abovelisted factors could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt agreements 

despite our current level of indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur substantially more debt and other obligations this could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition described above 

we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness and other obligations in the future including secured debt although the credit agreement governing our credit facility contains restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions the additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial in addition the credit agreement and the indenture governing our senior notes due 2025 and 2028 will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness if new debt is added to our current debt levels or we incur other obligations the related risks that we now face could intensify 

we may not be able to generate enough cash to service all our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness which may not be successful 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business legislative regulatory and other factors some of which are beyond our control we may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness 

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness we may not be able to effect any such alternative measures if necessary on commercially reasonable terms or at all and even if successful those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations our debt agreements restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due 

our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all would materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations and our ability to satisfy our debt obligations 

if we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt we will be in default and the lenders under our credit facility could terminate their commitments to loan money the lenders could foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings the holders of our senior notes could declare all outstanding principal premium if any and interest to be due and payable and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation these events could result in a loss of your investment 

we are required to comply with certain financial and operating covenants under our debt agreements any failure to comply with those covenants could cause amounts borrowed to become immediately due and payable andor prevent us from borrowing under the credit facility 

we are required to comply with specified financial and operating covenants under our debt agreements and to make payments under our debt which limit our ability to operate our business as we otherwise might operate it our failure to comply with any of these covenants or to meet any debt payment obligations could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived would result in any amounts outstanding including any accrued interest andor unpaid fees becoming immediately due and payable we might not have enough working capital or liquidity to satisfy any repayment obligations if those obligations were accelerated in addition if we are not in compliance with the financial and operating covenants under the credit facility when we wish to borrow funds we will be unable to borrow funds 

in addition the financial and operating covenants under the credit facility may limit our ability to borrow funds including for strategic acquisitions and share repurchases 

our credit facility has variable interest tied to libor and we could become subject to higher interest rates if the replacement rate we agree on with our banks is higher 

borrowings under our revolving credit facility use the london interbank offering rate libor as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate on march 5 2021 the intercontinental exchange benchmark administration the uk financial conduct authority fca regulated and authorized administrator of libor announced and the fca confirmed that one week and twomonth usd libor settings will cease on december 31 2021 and that the usd libor panel for all other tenors will cease on june 30 2023 

the credit facility provides a mechanism pursuant to which we and the administrative agent may agree under certain circumstances to transition to an alternate base rate borrowing or amend the credit facility to establish an alternate interest rate to libor that includes consideration of the thenprevailing market convention for determining interest rates for syndicated loans in the united states at that time 

although we believe the alternative rates will not materially increase the rates on our credit facility the final agreed rate may increase the cost of our variable rate indebtedness 

v risks related to our common stock 

our operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter making future operating results difficult to predict failure to meet market expectations could cause the price of our securities to decline 

our quarterly operating results historically have fluctuated and are likely to continue to fluctuate depending on many factors including 

• our adoption of accounting standards update 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 in 2019 creates significant revenue volatility 

• variability in our contracts including timing of start dates length of contracts and mix of onpremises and cloudbased purchases which would impact our revenue and earnings 

• the rate at which our existing contracts renew or churn 

• a significant percentage of our orders comes from transactions with large customers which tend to have long lead times that are less predictable 

• because our operating expenses are largely fixed in the short term and are based on expected bookings any failure to achieve our bookings targets could cause us to miss our near term earnings and cash flow targets 

• because a significant portion of our revenue and expenses are generated from outside the us shifts in foreign currency exchange rates have had and could continue to have an adverse effect on our reported results and 

• we may incur significant expenses in a quarter in connection with corporate development initiatives restructuring efforts or the investigation defense or settlement of legal actions that would increase our operating expenses and reduce our earnings for the quarter in which those expenses are incurred 

accordingly our quarterly results are difficult to predict prior to the end of the quarter and we may be unable to confirm or adjust expectations with respect to our operating results for a quarter until that quarter has closed any failure to meet our quarterly revenue or earnings expectations could adversely impact the market price of our securities 

our stock price has been volatile which may make it harder to resell shares at a favorable time and price 

market prices for securities of software companies are generally volatile and are subject to significant fluctuations that may be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies further our stock price has been more volatile than that of other software companies accordingly the trading prices and valuations of software companies’ stocks and of ours may not be predictable negative changes in the public’s perception of the prospects of software companies or of ptc or the markets we serve could depress our stock price regardless of our operating results 

also a large percentage of our common stock is held by institutional investors and by rockwell automation purchases and sales of our common stock by these investors could have a significant impact on the market price of the stock 

vi general risk factors 

our international businesses present economic and operating risks which could adversely affect our business and financial results 

we expect that our international operations will continue to expand and to account for a significant portion of our total revenue because we transact business in various foreign currencies the volatility of foreign exchange rates has had and may in the future have a material adverse effect on our revenue expenses and operating results 

other risks inherent in our international operations include but are not limited to the following 

• difficulties in staffing and managing foreign sales and development operations 

• increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities 

• increased regulatory and compliance risks 

• inadequate local infrastructure and 

• greater difficulty in protecting our intellectual property 

we may have exposure to additional tax liabilities and our effective tax rate may increase or fluctuate which could increase our income tax expense reduce our net income and increase our tax payment obligations 

as a multinational organization we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes in the us and in various foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision and other tax liabilities in the ordinary course of a global business there are many intercompany transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain our tax returns are subject to review by various taxing authorities although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes could be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 

our effective tax rate and tax payment obligations can be adversely affected by several factors many of which are outside of our control including 

• changes in tax laws for example the introduction of an amendment to section 174 of the us tax legislation regulations and interpretations in multiple jurisdictions in which we operate 

• assessments and any related tax interest or penalties by taxing authorities 

• changes in the relative proportions of revenues and income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates 

• changes to the financial accounting rules for income taxes 

• unanticipated changes in tax rates and 

• changes to a valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets if any

executive overview 

arr increased 7 16 constant currency to 1572 million in fy’22 compared to the end of fy’21 excluding the impact of codebeamer which we acquired in the third quarter of fy’22 organic arr growth was 6 15 constant currency in fy’22 compared to fy’21 

fy’22 revenue of 193 billion increased 7 over fy’21 11 in constant currency fy’22 operating margin of 23 increased approximately 200 basis points over fy’21 and nongaap operating margin of 38 increased approximately 300 basis points operating margin improvements are due to higher revenue and continued operating expense discipline fy’22 diluted eps was 265 compared to 403 in fy21 diluted eps in fy22 included a 35 million nonoperating charge associated with the decrease in value of an equity investment in a publiclytraded company offset by a nonoperating 30 million credit associated with the sale of a portion of our plm services business diluted eps in fy21 benefited from gains associated with an equity investment in a publiclytraded company and income tax credits related to a release of a previously held valuation allowance fy22 nongaap diluted eps was 458 representing a 15 increase over nongaap diluted eps of 397 in fy21 

fy’22 operating cash flow of 435 million grew 18 over fy’21 fy’22 free cash flow of 416 million grew 21 over fy’21 fy22 operating cash flow and free cash flow included an 118 million outflow related to acquisition and transactionrelated costs and 408 million of restructuring payments we ended fy’22 with cash and cash equivalents of 272 million and gross debt of 136 billion with an aggregate interest rate of 39

1 see nongaap financial measures below for a reconciliation of our gaap results to our nongaap measures and impact of foreign currency exchange on results of operations below for a description of how we calculate our results on a constant currency basis 

2 for the september 30 2021 period to facilitate comparability we removed 62 million of arr associated with a vuforia ar product that we ceased selling as of september 30 2021 from our arr operating measure 

3 recurring revenue is comprised of onpremises subscription perpetual support and saas and cloud revenue 

4 cash flow from operations for fy’22 and fy’21 includes 408 million and 145 million of restructuring payments respectively cash from operations for fy’22 and fy’21 includes 118 million and 150 million of acquisition and transactionrelated payments respectively cash from operations for fy21 includes 179 million in unforecasted payments related to the prior period tax exposure from a nonus tax dispute 

impact of foreign currency exchange on results of operations 

approximately 55 of our revenue and 40 of our expenses are transacted in currencies other than the us dollar because we report our results of operations in us dollars currency translation particularly changes in the euro yen shekel and rupee relative to the us dollar affects our reported results changes in foreign currency exchange rates have been a headwind to reported results in fy’22 

the results of operations in the table above and the tables and discussions below about revenue by line of business product group and geographic region present both actual percentage changes year over year and percentage changes on a constant currency basis our constant currency disclosures are calculated by multiplying the results in local currency for fy22 and fy21 by the exchange rates in effect on september 30 2021 if fy22 reported results were converted into us dollars using the rates in effect as of september 30 2021 arr as of september 30 2022 would have been higher by 134 million and operating income in fy22 would have been 27 million higher 

revenue 

under asc 606 the volume mix and duration of contract types support saas onpremises subscription starting or renewing in any given period may have a material impact on revenue in the period and as a result can impact the comparability of reported revenue periodoverperiod we recognize revenue for the license portion of onpremises subscription contracts up front when we deliver the licenses to the customer typically on the start date and we recognize revenue on the support element of onpremises subscription contracts and standalone support contracts ratably over the term we continue to convert existing support contracts to onpremises subscriptions resulting in a shift to upfront recognition of onpremises subscription license revenue in the period converted compared to ratable recognition for a perpetual support contract revenue from our cloud services primarily saas contracts is recognized ratably as we continue to expand our saas offerings and release additional cloud functionality into our products and customers begin to migrate from onpremises subscriptions to saas products we expect that over time a higher portion of our revenue will be recognized ratably given the different mix duration and volume of new and renewing contracts in any period yearoveryear or sequential revenue comparisons can vary significantly 

revenue by line of business 

 

  

1 includes perpetual licenses and the license portion of subscription sales 

2 includes support on perpetual licenses and the support portion of subscription sales 

 

the strengthening of the us dollar compared to foreign currencies had a substantial impact on our revenue growth in fy22 on an actual currency basis fy22 revenue increased 126 million 7 compared to an increase of 202 million 11 on a constant currency basis 

software revenue increased in fy’22 compared to fy’21 due to growth of windchill and arena revenue in the americas and contribution from the recently acquired codebeamer business in europe offset by a decline in creo revenue primarily driven by foreign currency fluctuations in europe and changes in contract durations in fy22 our average durations for onpremises subscriptions starting in the year decreased slightly resulting in a reduced revenue benefit compared to fy21 which benefited from significant increases in average contractual durations due to business rule changes 

professional services revenue in fy’22 compared to fy21 reflects an increase in revenue associated with large plm consulting engagements particularly with automotive aerospace and defense and consumer electronics customers professional services revenue in the first half of fy’21 was negatively impacted by services delivery challenges associated with the covid19 pandemic 

our longterm expectation is that professional services revenue will trend down over time as we migrate more services engagements to our partners and deliver products that require less consulting and training services as described in part i item 1 business above in the second half of fy22 we accelerated this strategy through the sale of a portion of our plm services business to itc infotech 

revenue and arr by product group 

 

 1 we describe our product groups for fy22 and fy21 and the change for fy23 including the products in each group in part i item 1 business above 

windchill software revenue increased by 12 16 constant currency driven by a significant increase in onpremises subscription license revenue and an increase in cloud services revenue windchill arr increased 10 19 constant currency in fy22 compared to fy21 

arena software revenue increased by 122 actual and constant currency driven by an increase in cloud services revenue and an increase in onpremises subscription license revenue arena was acquired in january 2021 so it did not contribute to fy21 revenue for the full year and purchase accounting adjustments to acquired deferred revenue had a greater impact on fy21 revenue than fy22 arena arr increased by 27 actual and constant currency in fy22 compared to fy21 

iiot software revenue increased by 7 10 constant currency driven by an increase in cloud services revenue iiot arr increased 14 21 constant currency in fy22 compared to fy21 

the codebeamer business which we acquired in the third quarter performed well and added a point of arr growth taking constant currency arr growth to 16 for the fourth quarter and full year codebeamer generated 9 million of revenue in fy22 with 6 million of onpremises subscription revenue and 2 million of perpetual support revenue codebeamer arr as of september 30 2022 was 16 million 18 million on a constant currency basis 

creo software revenue decreased by 1 primarily driven by the effect of foreign currency headwinds in europe creo software revenue increased 4 on a constant currency basis creo arr was flat increased 11 in constant currency in fy22 compared to fy21 

software revenue  arr by geographic region 

a significant portion of our software revenue is generated outside the us in both fy’22 and fy’21 approximately 40 to 45 of software revenue was generated in the americas 35 to 40 in europe and 15 to 20 in asia pacific 

 

 americas software revenue growth in fy’22 was driven by windchill revenue growth of 23 arena revenue growth of 133 and iiot revenue growth of 10 the increase in revenue from arena includes the effect of purchase accounting adjustments to reduce acquired deferred revenue americas arr was up 17 

europe software revenue declined in fy’22 driven by a 48 million foreign currency impact associated with the strengthening of the us dollar compared to foreign currencies creo revenue decreased 5 2 increase in constant currency partially offset by windchill revenue growth of 4 12 constant currency and the addition of codebeamer revenue arr in europe was up 16 constant currency 

asia pacific software revenue growth in fy’22 included a 19 million foreign currency impact associated with the strengthening of the us dollar compared to foreign currencies creo revenue grew 4 11 constant currency and windchill revenue grew 3 9 constant currency arr in asia pacific was up 13 constant currency 

gross margin 

 

  

1nongaap financial measures are reconciled to gaap results under nongaap financial measures below 

the strengthening of the us dollar compared to foreign currencies had a substantial impact on our gross margin increase in fy22 on an actual currency basis fy22 gross margin increased 111 million 8 compared to an increase of 176 million 12 on a constant currency basis 

license gross margin increased in fy’22 compared to fy’21 due to an increase in license revenue of 446 million and a decrease in cost of license of 125 million which was driven by lower amortization expense royalty expense and compensation costs 

support and cloud services gross margin increased in fy’22 compared to fy’21 due to increases in support and cloud services revenue of 763 million partially offset by increases in cost of support and cloud services of 207 million which were driven by higher compensation maintenance and hosting costs 

professional services gross margin decreased in fy’22 compared to fy’21 due to increases in professional services costs of 67 million including 51 million of stockbased compensation expense recognized in fy22 related to the sale of a portion of our plm services business in q322 partially offset by a 53 million increase in revenue 

operating expenses 

 

 the strengthening of the us dollar compared to foreign currencies had a substantial reduction to our operating expense increase in fy22 on an actual currency basis fy22 operating expenses increased 45 million 4 compared to an increase of 67 million 6 on a constant currency basis 

total headcount decreased by 3 in fy22 to 6503 from 6709 at the end of fy21 

operating expenses in fy22 compared to fy21 increased primarily due to the following 

• a 34 million increase in restructuring charges primarily due to the restructuring plan initiated in q1’22 

• a 9 million increase in travel expenses 

• a 6 million increase in intangible amortization expense 

• a 6 million increase in software subscriptions and 

• a 5 million increase in internal hosting costs 

partially offset by 

• a 12 million decrease in compensation expense including benefit costs due to lower headcount caused by attrition and restructuring actions and 

• a 6 million decrease in stockbased compensation 

interest expense 

 

  

interest expense includes interest under our credit facility and senior notes interest expense was higher in fy22 than fy21 we had 1359 million of total debt at september 30 2022 compared to 1450 million at september 30 2021 we repaid 355 million of our revolving credit facility in fy22 offset by 264 million borrowed at the end of april to fund the acquisition of the codebeamer business loans under the credit facility bear interest at variable rates which reset every 30 to 180 days as of september 30 2022 the annual rate for borrowings under the credit facility was 41 which has subsequently increased to 57 for additional detail on the changes in our debt structure see note 9 debt  included in the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report 

the average interest rate on our total borrowings was 34 in fy22 and 33 in fy21 

other income expense 

 

  

interest income represents earnings on the investment of our available cash and marketable securities 

the decrease in other income net in fy’22 over fy’21 was driven by a fy21 credit of 69 million associated with unrealized gains related to an equity investment in a publiclytraded company in fy22 the value of that equity investment decreased resulting in a 35 million charge that fy22 charge was offset by a gain on the sale of a portion of our plm services business of 30 million and 6 million of gains on the sale of other assets and investments 

income taxes 

 

 in fy’22 and fy’21 our effective tax rate is impacted by our corporate structure in which our foreign taxes are at a net effective tax rate lower than the us rate a significant amount of our foreign earnings is generated by our subsidiaries organized in ireland and the cayman islands in fy’22 and fy’21 the foreign rate differential predominantly relates to those earnings in addition to the foreign rate differential our tax rate differed from the statutory federal income tax rate due to the net effects of the global intangible lowtaxed income gilti and foreign derived intangible income fdii regimes together referred to as us tax reform and the excess tax benefit related to stockbased compensation 

additionally in fy’22 our results include tax expense relating to the book over tax basis difference on goodwill disposed of as part of the sale of a portion of our plm service business as a result of the net effect of these items in 2022 our effective tax rate did not differ significantly from the us federal income tax rate 

in fy’21 our tax rate includes a benefit due to the release of the valuation allowance on the majority of our us net deferred tax assets 

our results for the twelve months ended september 30 2021 include a charge of 373 million related to the effects of a tax matter in the republic of korea south korea of 344 million and the resulting impact on us income taxes of 29 million the charge related to an assessment with respect to various tax issues primarily foreign withholding taxes in south korea we made additional payments of approximately 20 million to the tax authorities in south korea in fy’21 for the years 2016 to 2021 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

  

cash cash equivalents and restricted cash 

we invest our cash with highly rated financial institutions and in diversified domestic and international money market mutual funds cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at september 30 2022 cash and cash equivalents totaled 272 million compared to 327 million at september 30 2021 

a significant portion of our cash is generated and held outside the us as of september 30 2022 we had cash and cash equivalents of 11 million in the us 105 million in europe 128 million in asia pacific including india and 28 million in other nonus countries we have substantial cash requirements in the us but we believe that the combination of our existing us cash and cash equivalents marketable securities our ability to repatriate cash to the us future us operating cash flows and cash available under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our ongoing us operating expenses and known capital requirements 

cash provided by operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities was 435 million in fy22 compared to 369 million in fy21 the yearoveryear increase is primarily due to approximately 170 million of higher cash collections offset by 30 million more in salary and salaryrelated payments a 57 million increase in disbursements largely related to prepayments made in fy22 and a 12 million increase in taxrelated payments 

restructuring payments totaled 41 million in fy22 compared to 15 million in fy21 cash paid for income taxes was 55 million in fy22 compared to 58 million in fy21 

cash used in investing activities 

 

  

 

cash used in investing activities in fy22 reflects 278 million 264 million of which we borrowed under our credit facility used to acquire the codebeamer business in fy22 compared to 718 million used in fy’21 for the arena acquisition offset by fy22 proceeds from the sale of a portion of our plm services business of 33 million and proceeds from the sale of investments of 47 million for additional detail on our acquisitions see note 6 acquisitions and disposition of business of notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report 

cash used in provided by financing activities 

 

  

cash used in financing activities in fy’22 reflects borrowings of 264 million offset by repayments of 355 million under our credit facility repurchases of common stock of 125 million payments of withholding taxes related to stockbased awards of 69 million and proceeds from the issuance of common stock of 21 million in fy21 net borrowings of 600 million were offset by 168 million of repayments under our credit facility repurchases of common stock of 30 million and payments of withholding taxes related to stockbased awards of 53 million 

outstanding debt 

as of september 30 2022 we had 

 

  

as of september 30 2022 we were in compliance with all financial and operating covenants of the credit facility and the note indentures any failure to comply with such covenants under the credit facility would prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under the credit facility and as with any failure to comply with such covenants under the note indentures could constitute a default that could cause all amounts outstanding to become due and payable immediately loans under the credit facility bear interest at variable rates which reset every 30 to 180 days as of september 30 2022 the annual rate for borrowings outstanding was 41 which has subsequently increased to 57 

our credit facility and our senior notes are described in note 9 debt of notes to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report 

share repurchase authorization 

our articles of organization authorize us to issue up to 500 million shares of our common stock our board of directors has authorized us to repurchase up to 1 billion of our common stock through september 30 2023 we may use cash from operations and borrowings under our credit facility to make any such repurchases all shares of our common stock repurchased are automatically restored to the status of authorized and unissued 

in fy22 and in fy21 we repurchased 105 million shares for 125 million and approximately 023 million shares in the open market for 30 million respectively 

our longterm goal is to return approximately 50 of our free cash flow to shareholders via share repurchases while also taking into consideration the interest rate environment and strategic initiatives and acquisitions which could cause us to reduce suspend or cease repurchases 

expectations for fiscal 2023 

we believe that existing cash and cash equivalents together with cash generated from operations and amounts available under the credit facility and otherwise will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements which we expect to be approximately 20 million in fy’23 through at least the next twelve months and to meet our known longterm capital requirements 

our expected uses and sources of cash could change our cash position could be reduced and we could incur additional debt obligations if we engage in strategic transactions retire debt or repurchase shares any of which could be commenced suspended or completed at any time any share repurchases or debt retirement will depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors such debt retirement or issuance share repurchases or strategic transactions may be material we regularly borrow under our credit facility to make strategic acquisitions and expect to continue to do so and may substantially increase our indebtedness to pursue strategic acquisitions which would increase our debt repayment obligations including related interest obligations 

contractual obligations 

at september 30 2022 our future contractual obligations were related to debt leases pension liabilities unrecognized tax benefits and purchase obligations see note 9 debt note 19 leases note 14 pension plans and note 8 income taxes of notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report for information about those obligations which notes are incorporated by reference into this section our purchase obligations were approximately 1614 million with 642 million expected to be paid in fy23 and 972 million thereafter purchase obligations represent minimum commitments due to third parties including royalty contracts research and development contracts telecommunication contracts information technology maintenance contracts in support of internaluse software and hardware financing leases operating leases with original terms of less than 12 months and other marketing and consulting contracts contracts for which our commitment is variable based on volumes with no fixed minimum quantities and contracts that can be canceled without payment penalties are not included in the purchase obligation amounts above the purchase obligations included above are in addition to amounts included in current liabilities and prepaid expenses recorded on our september 30 2022 consolidated balance sheet 

as of september 30 2022 we had letters of credit and bank guarantees outstanding of approximately 15 million of which 05 million was collateralized 

operating measure 

arr 

arr annual run rate represents the annualized value of our portfolio of active subscription software cloud saas and support contracts as of the end of the reporting period 

we believe arr is a valuable operating metric to measure the health of a subscription business because it captures expected subscription and support cash generation from customers because this measure represents the annualized value of customer contracts as of a point in time it does not represent revenue for any particular period or remaining revenue that will be recognized in future periods 

nongaap financial measures 

the nongaap financial measures presented in the discussion of our results of operations and the respective most directly comparable gaap measures are 

• free cash flow—cash flow from operations 

• nongaap gross margin—gaap gross margin 

• nongaap operating income—gaap operating income 

• nongaap operating margin—gaap operating margin 

• nongaap net income—gaap net income 

• nongaap diluted earnings or loss per share—gaap diluted earnings or loss per share 

free cash flow is cash flow from operations net of capital expenditures which are expenditures for property and equipment and consist primarily of facility improvements office equipment computer equipment and software we believe that free cash flow in conjunction with cash from operations is a useful measure of liquidity since capital expenditures are a necessary component of ongoing operations 

the nongaap financial measures other than free cash flow exclude as applicable stockbased compensation expense amortization of acquired intangible assets acquisition and transactionrelated charges included in general and administrative expenses restructuring and other charges net nonoperating charges and income tax adjustments 

the items excluded from these nongaap financial measures are normally included in the comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with gaap our management excludes these items when evaluating our ongoing performance andor predicting our earnings trends and therefore excludes them when presenting nongaap financial measures management uses nongaap financial measures in conjunction with our gaap results as should investors 

stockbased compensation is a noncash expense relating to stockbased awards issued to executive officers employees and outside directors consisting of restricted stock units we exclude this expense as it is a noncash expense and we assess our internal operations excluding this expense and believe it facilitates comparisons to the performance of other companies in our industry 

amortization of acquired intangible assets is a noncash expense that is impacted by the timing and magnitude of our acquisitions we believe the assessment of our operations excluding these costs is relevant to our assessment of internal operations and comparisons to the performance of other companies in our industry 

acquisition and transactionrelated charges included in general and administrative expenses are direct costs of potential and completed acquisitions and expenses related to acquisition integration activities including transaction fees due diligence costs severance and professional fees subsequent adjustments to our initial estimated amount of contingent consideration associated with specific acquisitions are also included within acquisition and transactionrelated charges other transactional charges include thirdparty costs related to structuring unusual transactions we do not include these costs when reviewing our operating results internally the occurrence and amount of these costs will vary depending on the timing and size of acquisitions and transactions 

restructuring and other charges net includes excess facility restructuring charges credits impairment and accretion expense charges related to the lease assets of exited facilities sublease income from previously impaired facilities and severance costs resulting from reductions of personnel and thirdparty professional consulting fees related to modifications of our business strategy these costs may vary in size based on our restructuring plan 

nonoperating charges credits includes gains or losses associated with sales or changes in value of assets or liabilities which are generally investing or financing in nature and are inconsistent with our ordinary operating activities in fy22 we recorded gains associated with the sale of assets including the sale of a portion of our plm services business additionally in fy22 we recorded a loss associated with the reduction in value of an equity investment in a publiclytraded company in fy21 we recorded a gain related to the change in value of an equity investment in a publiclytraded company 

income tax adjustments include the tax impact of the items above and assumes that we are profitable on a nongaap basis in the us and one foreign jurisdiction it also eliminates the effect of the valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets in those jurisdictions additionally we exclude other material tax items that we do not include when reviewing our operating results internally 

we use these nongaap financial measures and we believe that they assist our investors to make periodtoperiod comparisons of our operational performance because they provide a view of our operating results without items that are not in our view indicative of our core operating results we believe that these nongaap financial measures help illustrate underlying trends in our business and we use the measures to establish budgets and operational goals communicated internally and externally for managing our business and evaluating our performance we believe that providing nongaap financial measures also affords investors a view of our operating results that may be more easily compared to the results of other companies in our industry that use similar financial measures to supplement their gaap results 

the items excluded from the nongaap financial measures often have a material impact on our financial results and such items often recur accordingly the nongaap financial measures included in this annual report should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for or superior to the comparable measures prepared in accordance with gaap the following tables reconcile each of these nongaap financial measures to its most closely comparable gaap measure on our financial statements 

 

  

1 nonoperating net credits for fy22 include a 298 million gain on the sale of a portion of our plm services business a 34 million gain on sale of an asset and a 30 million gain on sale of an investment offset by a 348 million expense recognized due to the reduction in value of an equity investment in a publiclytraded company nonoperating credits for fy21 include a 688 million gain associated with an increase in value of an equity investment in a publiclytraded company 

2 income tax adjustments reflect the tax effects of nongaap adjustments which are calculated by applying the applicable tax rate by jurisdiction to the nongaap adjustments listed above in fy22 adjustments include tax expense of 155 million related to the sale of a portion of our plm services business of which 81 million pertains to the basis difference in goodwill our fy21 gaap results included benefits of 1797 million related to the release of the valuation allowance on the majority of our us net deferred tax assets as we were profitable on a nongaap basis the fy21 tax provision was calculated assuming there was no valuation allowance additionally our nongaap results for fy21 excluded tax expenses of 348 million related to a nonus prior period tax exposure primarily related to foreign withholding taxes

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we have prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america in preparing our financial statements we make estimates assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our reported revenues results of operations and net income as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet these estimates assumptions and judgments are made based on our historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances these estimates may change as new events occur or additional information is obtained and we may periodically be faced with uncertainties the outcomes of which are not within our control and may not be known for a prolonged period of time 

the accounting policies methods and estimates used to prepare our financial statements are described generally in note 2 summary of significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report the most important accounting judgments and estimates that we made in preparing the financial statements involved 

• revenue recognition 

• accounting for income taxes and 

• valuation of assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations 

a critical accounting policy is one that is both material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires us to make subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies require us to make assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time of the estimate and different estimates that we could have used or changes in the estimates that are reasonably likely to occur may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process actual results could differ from those estimates 

accounting policies guidelines and interpretations related to our critical accounting policies and estimates are generally subject to numerous sources of authoritative guidance and are often reexamined by accounting standards rule makers and regulators these rule makers andor regulators may promulgate interpretations guidance or regulations that may result in changes to our accounting policies which could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 

revenue recognition 

we record revenues in accordance with the guidance provided by asc 606 revenue from contracts with customers  for a full description of our revenue accounting policy refer to note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  included in the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report 

our sources of revenue include 1 subscriptions 2 perpetual licenses 3 support for perpetual licenses and 4 professional services subscriptions include termbased onpremises licenses softwareasaservice saas and hosting services 

judgments and estimates 

determination of performance obligations our subscriptions are frequently sold as a bundle of products and services typically pairing onpremises term software licenses with support andor cloud services over the same term onpremises software is typically determined to be a distinct performance obligation and is thus recognized separately from the support andor cloud components onpremises license software revenue is generally recognized at the point in time that the software is made available to the customer while the support and cloud software revenue components are recognized over the term of the contract in cases where subscriptions include cloud functionality and onpremises software an assessment has been performed to determine whether the cloud services are distinct from the onpremises software in the substantial majority of instances cloud services provide incremental functionality to customers and have been considered distinct and recognized separately from the onpremises software this assessment could have a significant impact on the timing of revenue recognition and may change as our product offerings evolve 

allocation of transaction price we estimate the standalone selling price of each identified performance obligation and use that estimate to allocate the transaction price among said performance obligations the estimated standalone selling price is determined using all information reasonably available to us including market conditions and other observable inputs significant judgment is used in determining the standalone selling prices of the onpremises license support and cloud components of our subscription products these estimates are subject to change as our product offerings change and could have a significant impact due to the difference in the timing of revenue recognition for onpremises licenses and support andor cloud 

right to exchange our multiyear noncancellable onpremises subscription contracts provide customers with an annual right to exchange software within the original subscription with other software we account for this right as a liability for most contracts we use the expected value method to determine the liability associated with this right across a portfolio of contracts where contracts are outside of the standard portfolio of contracts due to contract size longer contract duration or other unique contractual terms we use the most likely amount method to determine the liability for each individual contract in both circumstances the transaction price is constrained based on our estimates which impacts the amount of revenue recognized changes in these estimates could significantly impact revenue for any given period 

accounting for income taxes 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to calculate our income tax expense based on taxable income by jurisdiction there are many transactions and calculations about which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain as a result our calculations involve estimates by management some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenuesharing costreimbursement and transfer pricing arrangements among related entities and the differing tax treatment of revenue and cost items across various jurisdictions if we were compelled to revise or to account differently for our arrangements that revision could affect our recorded tax liabilities 

the income tax accounting process also involves estimating our actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheets we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized we must establish a valuation allowance as a charge to income tax expense 

as of september 30 2022 we have a valuation allowance of 178 million against net deferred tax assets in the us and a valuation allowance of 45 million against net deferred tax assets in certain foreign jurisdictions we have concluded based on the weight of available evidence that a full valuation allowance is not required against our us net deferred tax assets as they are more likely than not to be realized in the future we will continue to reassess our valuation allowance requirements each financial reporting period 

the valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets of certain foreign jurisdictions is established primarily for our capital loss carryforwards the majority of which do not expire however there are limitations imposed on the utilization of such capital losses that could further restrict the recognition of any tax benefits 

prior to the passage of the us tax act the company asserted that substantially all of the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries were considered indefinitely invested and accordingly no deferred taxes were provided pursuant to the provisions of the us tax act these earnings were subjected to a onetime transition tax and there is therefore no longer a material cumulative basis difference associated with the undistributed earnings we maintain our assertion to permanently reinvest these earnings outside the us unless repatriation can be done substantially taxfree with the exception of a foreign holding company formed in 2018 and our taiwan subsidiary if we decide to repatriate any additional nonus earnings in the future we may be required to establish a deferred tax liability on such earnings the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability on the undistributed earnings would not be material 

in the normal course of business ptc and its subsidiaries are examined by various taxing authorities including the internal revenue service irs in the us we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate we are currently under audit by tax authorities in several jurisdictions audits by tax authorities typically involve examination of the deductibility of certain permanent items transfer pricing limitations on net operating losses and tax credits although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in material changes in our estimates 

valuation of assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations 

in accordance with business combination accounting we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values determining these fair values requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets 

our identifiable intangible assets acquired consist of developed technology core technology tradenames customer lists and contracts and software support agreements and related relationships developed technology consists of products that have reached technological feasibility core technology represents a combination of processes inventions and trade secrets related to the design and development of acquired products customer lists and contracts and software support agreements and related relationships represent the underlying relationships and agreements with customers of the acquired company’s installed base we have generally valued intangible assets using a discounted cash flow model critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to 

• future expected cash flows from software license sales customer support agreements customer contracts and related customer relationships and acquired developed technologies and trademarks and trade names and 

• discount rates used to determine the present value of estimated future cash flows 

in addition we estimate the useful lives of our intangible assets based upon the expected period over which we anticipate generating economic benefits from the related intangible asset 

net tangible assets consist of the fair values of tangible assets less the fair values of assumed liabilities and obligations except for deferred revenues net tangible assets were generally valued by us at the respective carrying amounts recorded by the acquired company if we believed that their carrying values approximated their fair values at the acquisition date for acquisitions completed prior to fy22 the values assigned to deferred revenue reflect an amount equivalent to the estimated cost plus an appropriate profit margin to perform the services related to the acquired company’s software support contracts during fy22 we adopted asu 202108 whereby deferred revenue for acquisitions completed in fy22 reflect the amounts that would have been deferred as of the acquisition date in accordance with asc 606 

in addition uncertain tax positions and taxrelated valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date and we reevaluate these items quarterly with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill provided that we are within the measurement period up to one year from the acquisition date and we continue to collect information in order to determine their estimated values subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the estimated value of uncertain tax positions or taxrelated valuation allowances whichever comes first changes to these uncertain tax positions and taxrelated valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of operations 

our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable at that time but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions estimates or actual results 

when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a finitelived intangible asset may not be recoverable we perform an assessment of the asset for potential impairment this assessment is based on projected undiscounted future cash flows over the asset’s remaining life if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its undiscounted cash flows we record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset determined using projected discounted future cash flows of the asset 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in accordance with recently issued accounting pronouncements we will be required to comply with certain changes in accounting rules and regulations none of which are expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements refer to note 2 summary of significant accounting policies of notes to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report for all recently issued accounting pronouncements which is incorporated herein by reference 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have not created and are not party to any specialpurpose or offbalance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital incurring debt or operating parts of our business that are not consolidated to the extent of our ownership interest therein into our financial statements we have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby we have subordinated retained interests derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks contingent liabilities or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing liquidity market risk or credit risk support to us 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we face exposure to financial market risks including adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 

foreign currency exchange risk 

our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to western european countries japan israel china and canada we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates that arise from receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies we do not enter into or hold foreign currency derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes nor do we enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge future cash flows or forecast transactions 

our nonus revenues generally are transacted through our nonus subsidiaries and typically are denominated in their local currency in addition expenses that are incurred by our nonus subsidiaries typically are denominated in their local currency approximately 55 of our revenue and 40 of our expenses were transacted in currencies other than the us dollar currency translation affects our reported results because we report our results of operations in us dollars historically our most significant currency risk has been changes in the euro and japanese yen relative to the us dollar based on current revenue and expense levels excluding restructuring charges and stockbased compensation a 010 change in the usd to eur exchange rate and a 10 yen change in the yen to usd exchange rate would impact operating income by approximately 32 million and 12 million respectively 

our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations arises in part from intercompany transactions with most intercompany transactions occurring between a us dollar functional currency entity and a foreign currency denominated entity intercompany transactions typically are denominated in the local currency of the nonus dollar functional currency subsidiary in order to centralize foreign currency risk also both ptc the parent company and our nonus subsidiaries may transact business with our customers and vendors in a currency other than their functional currency transaction risk in addition we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results and balances of our nonus subsidiaries are translated into us dollars translation risk if sales to customers outside the united states increase our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will increase 

our foreign currency risk management strategy is principally designed to mitigate the future potential financial impact of changes in the us dollar value of balances denominated in foreign currency resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates our foreign currency hedging program uses forward contracts to manage the foreign currency exposures that exist as part of our ongoing business operations the contracts are primarily denominated in japanese yen and european currencies and have maturities of less than four months 

the majority of our foreign currency forward contracts are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes and changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized immediately in earnings because we enter into forward contracts only as an economic hedge any gain or loss on the underlying foreigndenominated balance would be offset by the loss or gain on the forward contract gains and losses on forward contracts and foreign currency denominated receivables and payables are included in foreign currency net losses 

as of september 30 2022 and 2021 we had outstanding forward contracts for derivatives not designated as hedging instruments with notional amounts equivalent to the following 

 

  

debt 

in addition to the 1 billion due under our 2025 and 2028 senior notes as of september 30 2022 we had 359 million outstanding under our credit facility loans under the credit facility bear interest at variable rates which reset every 30 to 180 days depending on the rate and period selected by us these loans are subject to interest rate risk as interest rates will be adjusted at each rollover date to the extent such amounts are not repaid as of september 30 2022 the annual rate on the credit facility loans was 414 if there were a 100 basis point change in interest rates the annual net impact to earnings and cash flows would be 36 million this change in cash flows and earnings has been calculated based on the borrowings outstanding at september 30 2022 and a 100 basis point per annum change in interest rate applied over a oneyear period 

cash and cash equivalents 

as of september 30 2022 cash equivalents were invested in highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased we invest our cash with highly rated financial institutions in north america europe and asia pacific and in diversified domestic and international money market mutual funds at september 30 2022 we had cash and cash equivalents of 11 million in the united states 105 million in europe 128 million in asia pacific including india and 28 million in other nonus countries given the short maturities and investment grade quality of the portfolio holdings at september 30 2022 a hypothetical 10 change in interest rates would not materially affect the fair value of our cash and cash equivalents 

our invested cash is subject to interest rate fluctuations and for nonus operations foreign currency exchange rate risk in a declining interest rate environment we would experience a decrease in interest income the opposite holds true in a rising interest rate environment over the past several years the us federal reserve board european central bank and bank of england have changed certain benchmark interest rates which has led to declines and increases in market interest rates these changes in market interest rates have resulted in fluctuations in interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents interest income will continue to fluctuate based on changes in market interest rates and levels of cash available for investment changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar had an unfavorable impact of 242 million and 01 million on our consolidated cash balances in 2022 and 2021 respectively in particular due to changes in the euro and the japanese yen

our markets and how we address them

we compete in the cad plm iiot and ar markets the markets we serve present different growth opportunities for us we see greater opportunity for market growth for our iiot and ar solutions for the enterprise and our saas solutions followed by more moderate market growth for our onpremise cad and plm solutions both of which have been growing faster than their respective market growth rates

risk factors

tableend

the following are important factors we have identified that could affect our future results and your investment in our securities you should consider them carefully when evaluating an investment in ptc securities or any forwardlooking statements made by us including those contained in this annual report because these factors could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or the performance projected in forwardlooking statements the risks described below are not the only risks we face additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business financial condition andor operating results 

i risks related to our business operations and industry 

we face significant competition which may reduce our profitability and limit or reduce our market share

the markets for our products and solutions are rapidly changing and characterized by intense competition disruptive technology developments evolving distribution models and increasingly lower barriers to entry if we are unable to provide products and solutions that address customers’ needs as well as our competitors’ products and solutions do or to align our pricing licensing and delivery models with customer preferences we could lose customers andor fail to attract new customers which could cause us to lose revenue and market share

for example the covid19 pandemic has caused companies worldwide to close their offices and their employees to have to work remotely from their homes which has focused companies on the need for solutions that empower and support remote work by employees we believe customers and potential customers will increasingly seek software solutions that support remote work by employees although many of our solutions support remote work others are less efficient at doing so we have embarked on an effort to make our solutions available on a saas platform however this will require significant effort and investment and we cannot be sure that we will be able to make our solutions available as saas solutions as quickly as we expect or that customers will adopt them as we expect if we are unable to compete successfully with competitors offering saas solutions we could lose customers andor fail to attract new customers which could cause us to lose revenue and market share which would adversely affect our business and financial results

in addition competitive pressures could cause us to reduce our prices which could reduce our revenue and margins

finally our current and potential competitors range from large and wellestablished companies to emerging startups some of our competitors and potential competitors have greater name recognition in the markets we serve and greater financial technical sales and marketing and other resources which could limit our ability to gain customer recognition and confidence in our products and solutions and successfully sell our products and solutions which could adversely affect our ability to grow our business

a breach of security in our products or computer systems or those of our thirdparty service providers could compromise the integrity of our products cause loss of data harm our reputation create additional liability and adversely impact our financial results

we have implemented and continue to implement measures intended to maintain the security and integrity of our products source code and it systems the potential for a security breach or system disruption has significantly increased over time as the scope number intensity and sophistication of attempted cyberattacks and cyber intrusions have increased we face cyberattacks and intrusions designed to access and exfiltrate information and to disrupt and lockup access to systems for the purpose of demanding a ransom payment despite efforts to create security barriers to such threats it is impossible for us to eliminate the risk of a successful cyberattack or intrusion and in fact we deal with security issues on a regular basis and have experienced security incidents from time to time accordingly there is a risk that a cyberattack or intrusion will be successful and that such event will be material

in addition we offer cloud services to our customers and some of our products including our saas products are hosted by thirdparty service providers which expose us to additional risks as those repositories of our customers’ proprietary data may be targeted and a cyberattack or intrusion may be 

 

successful and material interception of data transmission misappropriation or modification of data corruption of data and attacks against our service providers may adversely affect our products or product and service delivery malicious code viruses or vulnerabilities that are undetected by our service providers may disrupt our business operations generally and may have a disproportionate effect on those of our products that are developed and delivered in the cloud environment 

while we devote resources to maintaining the security and integrity of our products and systems as well as performing due diligence of our thirdparty service providers a significant breach of the security andor integrity of our products or systems or those of our thirdparty service providers could prevent our products from functioning properly could enable access to sensitive proprietary or confidential information including that of our customers or could disrupt our business operations or those of our customers this could require us to incur significant costs of investigation remediation andor payment of a ransom harm our reputation cause customers to stop buying our products and cause us to face lawsuits and potential liability which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations

we increasingly rely on thirdparty providers of cloud infrastructure services to deliver our offerings to users on our platform and any disruption of or interference with our use of these services could adversely affect our business 

our continued growth depends in part on the ability of our existing and potential customers to use and access our cloud services or our website in order to download our software or encrypted access keys for our software within an acceptable amount of time we use a number of thirdparty service providers which we do not control for key components of our infrastructure particularly with respect to development and delivery of our cloudbased products the use of these service providers gives us greater flexibility in efficiently delivering a more tailored scalable customer experience but also exposes us to additional risks and vulnerabilities thirdparty service providers operate their own platforms that we access and we are therefore vulnerable to their service interruptions we may experience interruptions delays and outages in service and availability from time to time as a result of problems with our thirdparty service providers’ infrastructure lack of availability of this infrastructure could be due to a number of potential causes including technical failures natural disasters fraud or security attacks that we cannot predict or prevent such outages could lead to the triggering of our service level agreements and the issuance of credits to our cloudbased product customers which may impact our business and consolidated financial statements

if we are unable to renew our agreements with our cloud service providers on commercially reasonable terms or our agreement is prematurely terminated or we need to add new cloud services providers to increase capacity and uptime we could experience interruptions downtime delays and additional expenses related to transferring to and providing support for these new platforms any of the above circumstances or events may harm our reputation and brand reduce the availability or usage of our platforms and impair our ability to attract new users any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may be unable to hire or retain personnel with the necessary skills to operate and grow our business which could adversely affect our ability to compete

our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial sales and marketing technical financial and administrative personnel to operate and grow our business competition for such personnel in our industry is intense particularly in the boston massachusetts area where our global headquarters is located

the technical personnel required to develop our products and solutions are in high demand particularly technical personnel with augmented and virtual reality and analytics expertise as there are comparatively fewer persons with those skills if we are unable to attract and retain technical personnel with the requisite skills our product and solution development efforts could be delayed which could adversely affect our ability to compete and thereby adversely affect our revenues and profitability

 

the managerial sales and marketing financial and administrative personnel necessary to guide our operations market and sell our solutions and support our business operations are also in high demand due to the intense competition in our industry 

if we are unable to attract and retain the personnel we need to develop compelling products and solutions and guide operate and support our business we may be unable to successfully compete in the marketplace which would adversely affect our revenues and profitability

 

the extent to which the covid19 pandemic may impact our business is uncertain and it could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

the covid19 pandemic continues to impact global economic activity and create macroeconomic uncertainty public and private sector policies and initiatives to reduce the transmission of covid19 such as the imposition of travel restrictions temporary closures of businesses and the adoption of remote working have significantly changed the way we and our customers work the effects and duration of this disruption remain uncertain 

while ptc was able to transition to remote working without significant disruption to our daytoday operations disruption to our customers’ and our prospects’ operations and the way we work with them have adversely affected our business

demand for our solutions declined and could decline further due to challenges associated with conducting inperson sales meetings and project scoping and implementation activities while social distancing measures are in place which has deterred or prevented and could further deter or prevent customers from proceeding with new software purchases and deployments likewise temporary plant closures layoffs and furloughs at our customers and the challenges they face forecasting business needs in this time of global economic uncertainty have caused and could continue to cause our customers to delay or reduce new license purchases 

longer term plant closures and layoffs among our customer base could cause existing subscription customers to renew fewer existing licenses when their subscriptions come up for renewal and could cause existing support customers to discontinue support at the time of renewal if churn increases in the future our arr and financial results and condition could be negatively impacted 

reductions in new subscription sales andor renewals and in professional services delivered could reduce our arr growth or cause our arr to decline and would reduce our professional services revenue all of which would adversely affect our revenue earnings and cash flow further prolonged disruption could continue to negatively impact the businesses of our customers and prospective customers and therefore our business and financial condition

if our business declines due to the factors above we could be required to reduce our expenses which could result in material restructuring charges andor reduce or delay investments in our business including hiring reductions in our workforce andor investments in our business could hamper our ability to recover and compete successfully which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we depend on sales within the discrete manufacturing sector and our business could be adversely affected if manufacturing activity does not grow or if it contracts or if manufacturers are adversely affected by other economic factors

a large amount of our sales are to customers in the discrete manufacturing sector manufacturers worldwide are facing increasing uncertainty about the global economic climate due to among other factors the covid19 pandemic and the geopolitical environment in addition within the technology industry the us administration’s focus on technology transactions with nonus entities and potential expanded prohibitions has created additional uncertainty in light of these concerns customers may delay reduce or forego purchases of our solutions which would adversely affect our business and financial results

 

if we fail to successfully manage our transition to a saas company our business and financial results could be adversely affected 

becoming a saas company requires considerable additional investment in our organization whether our transition will be successful and will accomplish our business and financial objectives is subject to uncertainties including but not limited to customer demand attach and renewal rates channel adoption our ability to further develop and scale infrastructure our ability to include functionality and usability in such offerings that address customer requirements and our costs if we are unable to successfully establish these new offerings and navigate our business transition due to these risks and uncertainties our business and financial results could be adversely impacted

because our sales and operations are globally dispersed we face additional compliance risks and any compliance failure could adversely affect our business and financial results

we sell and deliver software and services and maintain support operations in many countries whose laws and practices differ from one another and are subject to unexpected changes managing these geographically dispersed operations requires significant attention and resources to ensure compliance with laws of those countries and those of the us governing our activities in nonus countries

those laws include but are not limited to anticorruption laws and regulations including the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and the uk bribery act 2010 data privacy laws and regulations including the european unions general data privacy regulation and trade and economic sanctions laws and regulations including laws administered by the us department of the treasury’s office of foreign assets control the us state department the us department of commerce the united nations security council and other relevant sanctions authorities our compliance risks are heightened due to the gotomarket approach for our business that relies heavily on a partner ecosystem the fact that we operate in and are expanding into countries with a higher incidence of corruption and fraudulent business practices than others the fact that we deal with governments and stateowned business enterprises and the fact that global enforcement of laws has significantly increased

accordingly while we strive to maintain a comprehensive compliance program we cannot guarantee that an employee agent or business partner will not act in violation of our policies or us or other applicable laws or that we may inadvertently violate such laws investigations of alleged violations of those laws can be expensive and disruptive violations of such laws can lead to civil andor criminal prosecutions substantial fines and other sanctions including the revocation of our rights to continue certain operations and also cause business and reputation loss which could adversely affect our financial results andor stock price

ii risks related to acquisitions and strategic relationships

businesses we acquire may not generate the revenue and earnings we anticipate and may otherwise adversely affect our business

we have acquired and intend to continue to acquire new businesses and technologies if we fail to successfully integrate and manage the businesses and technologies we acquire if an acquisition does not further our business strategy as we expect or if a business we acquire has unexpected legal or financial liabilities our operating results will be adversely affected

the types of issues that we may face in integrating and operating the acquired business include







 





further if we do not achieve the expected return on our investments it could impair the intangible assets and goodwill that we recorded as part of an acquisition which could require us to record a reduction to the value of those assets

we may incur significant debt or issue a material amount of debt or equity securities to finance an acquisition which could adversely affect our operating flexibility and financial statements

if we were to incur a significant amount of debt—whether by borrowing funds or issuing new debt securities—to finance an acquisition our interest expense debt service requirements and leverage would increase significantly the increases in these expenses and in our leverage could adversely impact our ability to operate the company as we might otherwise and to borrow additional amounts

if we were to issue a significant amount of equity securities in connection with an acquisition existing stockholders would be diluted and earnings per share could decrease

our inability to maintain or develop our strategic and technology relationships could adversely affect our business

we have many strategic and technology relationships with other companies with which we work to offer complementary solutions and services that market and sell our solutions and that provide technologies that we embed in our solutions we may not realize the expected benefits from these relationships and such relationships may be terminated by the other party if these companies fail to perform or if a company terminates or substantially alters the terms of the relationship we could suffer delays in product development reduced sales or other operational difficulties and our business results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected

iii risks related to our intellectual property

we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights which could adversely affect our business and our ability to compete effectively

our software products are proprietary we protect our intellectual property rights in these items by relying on copyrights trademarks patents and common law safeguards including trade secret protection as well as restrictions on disclosures and transferability contained in our agreements with other parties despite these measures the laws of all relevant jurisdictions may not afford adequate protection to our products and other intellectual property in addition we frequently encounter attempts by individuals and companies to pirate our software if our measures to protect our intellectual property rights fail others may be able to use those rights which could reduce our competitiveness and revenues

in addition any legal action to protect our intellectual property rights that we may bring or be engaged in could be costly may distract management from daytoday operations and may lead to additional claims against us and we may not succeed all of which would materially adversely affect our operating results

intellectual property infringement claims could be asserted against us which could be expensive to defend and could result in limitations on our use of the claimed intellectual property

the software industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding copyright patent and other intellectual property rights if a lawsuit of this type is filed it could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel we cannot be sure that we would prevail against any such asserted claims if we did not prevail we could be prevented from using the claimed intellectual property or be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements which might not be available on terms acceptable to us in addition to possible claims with respect to our proprietary products some of our products contain technology developed by and licensed from third parties and we may likewise be susceptible to infringement claims with respect to these thirdparty technologies

 

iv risks related to our indebtedness 

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations as well as our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt

we have a significant amount of indebtedness as of november 19 2021 our total debt outstanding was approximately 1450 billion 1 billion of which was associated with the 3625 senior notes and 4000 senior notes together “senior notes” issued february 2020 which mature in february 2025 and 2028 respectively and are unsecured and 450 million of which was borrowed under our credit facility which matures in february 2025 all amounts outstanding under the credit facility and the senior notes will be due and payable in full on their respective maturity dates as of november 19 2021 we had unused commitments under our credit facility of 550 million ptc inc and one of our foreign subsidiaries are eligible borrowers under the credit facility and certain other foreign subsidiaries may become borrowers under our credit facility in the future subject to certain conditions

specifically our level of debt could



















any of the abovelisted factors could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt agreements

despite our current level of indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur substantially more debt and other obligations this could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition described above

we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness and other obligations in the future including secured debt although the credit agreement governing our credit facility contains restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions the additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial in addition the credit agreement and the indenture governing the senior notes will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness if new debt is added to our current debt levels or we incur other obligations the related risks that we now face could intensify 

 

we may not be able to generate enough cash to service all our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness which may not be successful 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business legislative regulatory and other factors some of which are beyond our control we may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness we may not be able to effect any such alternative measures if necessary on commercially reasonable terms or at all and even if successful those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations our debt agreements restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due

our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all would materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations and our ability to satisfy our debt obligations

if we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt we will be in default and the lenders under our credit facility could terminate their commitments to loan money the lenders could foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings the holders of our senior notes could declare all outstanding principal premium if any and interest to be due and payable and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation these events could result in a loss of your investment

we are required to comply with certain financial and operating covenants under our debt agreements any failure to comply with those covenants could cause amounts borrowed to become immediately due and payable andor prevent us from borrowing under the credit facility

we are required to comply with specified financial and operating covenants under our debt agreements and to make payments under our debt which limit our ability to operate our business as we otherwise might operate it our failure to comply with any of these covenants or to meet any debt payment obligations could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived would result in any amounts outstanding including any accrued interest andor unpaid fees becoming immediately due and payable we might not have enough working capital or liquidity to satisfy any repayment obligations if those obligations were accelerated in addition if we are not in compliance with the financial and operating covenants under the credit facility when we wish to borrow funds we will be unable to borrow funds

in addition the financial and operating covenants under the credit facility may limit our ability to borrow funds including for strategic acquisitions and share repurchases

our credit facility has variable interest tied to libor and we could become subject to higher interest rates if the replacement rate we agree on with our banks is higher

borrowings under our revolving credit facility use the london interbank offering rate libor as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate on march 5 2021 the intercontinental exchange benchmark administration the uk financial conduct authority fca regulated and authorized administrator of libor announced and the fca confirmed that one week and twomonth usd libor settings will cease on december 31 2021 and that the usd libor panel for all other tenors will cease on june 30 2023 

the credit facility provides a mechanism pursuant to which we and the administrative agent may agree under certain circumstances to transition to an alternate base rate borrowing or amend the 

 

credit facility to establish an alternate interest rate to libor that includes consideration of the thenprevailing market convention for determining interest rates for syndicated loans in the united states at that time 

although we believe the alternative rates will not materially increase the rates on our credit facility the final agreed rate may increase the cost of our variable rate indebtedness

v risks related to our common stock and common stock of public companies we own

our operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter making future operating results difficult to predict failure to meet market expectations could cause the price of our securities to decline

our quarterly operating results historically have fluctuated and are likely to continue to fluctuate depending on many factors including















accordingly our quarterly results are difficult to predict prior to the end of the quarter and we may be unable to confirm or adjust expectations with respect to our operating results for a quarter until that quarter has closed any failure to meet our quarterly revenue or earnings expectations could adversely impact the market price of our securities

our stock price has been volatile which may make it harder to resell shares at a favorable time and price

market prices for securities of software companies are generally volatile and are subject to significant fluctuations that may be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies further our stock price has been more volatile than that of other software companies accordingly the trading prices and valuations of software companies’ stocks and of ours may not be predictable negative changes in the public’s perception of the prospects of software companies or of ptc or the markets we serve could depress our stock price regardless of our operating results

 

also a large percentage of our common stock is held by institutional investors and by rockwell automation purchases and sales of our common stock by these investors could have a significant impact on the market price of the stock for more information about those investors please see our proxy statement with respect to our most recent annual meeting of stockholders and schedules 13d and 13g filed with the sec with respect to our common stock 

from time to time we may acquire common stock in publicly traded companies as strategic investments owning such stock exposes us to the volatility liquidity and other risks inherent in holding that stock

from time to time we may own common stock of publicly traded companies we are required to present the value of such stock on our consolidated balance sheet at their fair value at the end of each reporting period the fair value of those shares may fluctuate due to the volatility of the stock market changes in general economic conditions and the performance of these publicly traded companies we recognize all changes in the fair value of the owned shares whether realized or unrealized as gains or losses in our consolidated statement of operations accordingly changes in the fair value of the owned shares can materially impact the earnings we report which introduces volatility in our earnings that is not associated with the results of our business operations in particular significant declines in the fair value of the owned shares would produce significant declines in our reported earnings

the reported value of the owned shares does not necessarily reflect their lowest current market price if we were forced to sell some or all of the owned shares in the market there can be no assurance that we would be able to sell them at prices equivalent to the value that we have reported on our consolidated balance sheet and we may be forced to sell them at significantly lower prices

vi risks related to our senior notes

our senior notes are unsecured and do not limit our ability to incur indebtedness which could reduce any payments to holders of the senior notes in connection with any insolvency liquidation reorganization dissolution or other winding up of ptc

unlike the credit facility which is secured the senior notes are not secured although the indenture governing the senior notes limits our ability to incur secured debt the covenant is subject to significant exceptions and we may incur additional secured debt in the future the effect of this subordination is that upon a default in payment on or the acceleration of any of our secured indebtedness or in the event of bankruptcy insolvency liquidation dissolution or reorganization of our company collectively “adverse events” the proceeds from the sale of assets securing our secured indebtedness will be available to pay obligations on the senior notes only after all indebtedness under the credit facility and any other secured debt has been paid in full as a result the holders of the senior notes may receive less ratably than the holders of secured debt if an adverse event occurs

in addition the indenture governing the senior notes does not limit our ability to incur unsecured indebtedness if we incur any additional indebtedness that ranks equally with the senior notes subject to collateral arrangements the holders of that debt will be entitled to share ratably with holders of the senior notes in any proceeds distributed in connection with any of the adverse events described above this may reduce the amount of proceeds to holders of the senior notes 

our senior notes are not guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries which could adversely affect our ability to pay interest on or redeem the senior notes when due

we conduct a substantial portion of our operations through our subsidiaries none of which currently guarantees the senior notes accordingly payment of interest on the senior notes and redemption of the senior notes is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend debt repayment or otherwise unless they become guarantors of the senior notes our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on the senior notes or to make funds available for that purpose our subsidiaries may not be able to or may not be permitted to make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of the senior notes each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances legal and contractual restrictions may limit our 

 

ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries if we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries we may be unable to make required payments of principal premium if any and interest on the senior notes  

our senior notes are not listed on any national securities exchange or included in any automated quotation system which could make it harder to resell the notes at a favorable time and price

our senior notes are not listed on any national securities exchange or included in any automated quotation system as a result an active market for the notes may not exist or be maintained which would adversely affect the market price and liquidity of the notes in that case holders may not be able to sell their notes when they want to or at a favorable price

the market for noninvestment grade debt historically has been subject to severe disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the notes the market if any for the notes may experience similar disruptions and any such disruptions may adversely affect the liquidity in that market or the prices at which the notes may be sold

vii general risk factors

our international businesses present economic and operating risks which could adversely affect our business and financial results

we expect that our international operations will continue to expand and to account for a significant portion of our total revenue because we transact business in various foreign currencies the volatility of foreign exchange rates has had and may in the future have a material adverse effect on our revenue expenses and operating results

other risks inherent in our international operations include but are not limited to the following











we may have exposure to additional tax liabilities and our effective tax rate may increase or fluctuate which could increase our income tax expense and reduce our net income

as a multinational organization we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes in the us and in various foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision and other tax liabilities in the ordinary course of a global business there are many intercompany transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain our tax returns are subject to review by various taxing authorities although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes could be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 

our effective tax rate can be adversely affected by several factors many of which are outside of our control including

executive overview

arr increased 16 actual and constant currency to 1475 million in fy’21 compared to the end of fy’20 excluding the impact of arena which was acquired in the second quarter of fy’21 our organic constant currency arr growth was 12 in fy’21 compared to fy’20 organic churn improved approximately 130 basis points year over year primarily driven by strong execution in cad plm fsg and modest continued improvement in iot and ar 

fy’21 revenue of 181 billion increased 24 over fy’20 20 in constant currency our fy’21 revenue was positively impacted by asc 606 as longer contract durations and support to subscription conversions increased the amount of upfront subscription license revenue recognized in the year fy’21 operating margin of 21 increased approximately 700 basis points over fy’20 due to strong revenue performance as strong product differentiation improved sales and renewals while maintaining good discipline on our operating expense structure fy’21 diluted eps more than doubled year over year to 403 due in part to a gain of 69 million related to common stock we own in a publiclytraded company the release of a 137 million valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets in the us and a noncash tax benefit of 42 million related to our arena acquisition 

fy’21 operating cash flow of 369 million grew 58 over fy’20 fy’21 free cash flow of 344 million grew 61 over fy’20 operating cash flow and free cash flow included an 18 million outflow related to a foreign tax dispute 15 million of acquisitionrelated costs and 15 million of restructuring payments we ended fy’21 with cash and cash equivalents of 327 million in addition we held a 78 million equity investment in matterport inc currently subject to trading restrictions we ended fy’21 with gross debt of 145 billion with an aggregate interest rate of 32

impact of foreign currency exchange on results of operations

approximately 60 of our revenue and 40 of our expenses are transacted in currencies other than the us dollar because we report our results of operations in us dollars currency translation particularly changes in the euro yen shekel and rupee relative to the us dollar affects our reported results our constant currency disclosures are calculated by multiplying the results in local currency for fy’21 and fy’20 by the exchange rates in effect on september 30 2020 excluding the effect of any hedging if fy21 reported results were converted into us dollars based on this methodology fy21 revenue would have been lower by 20 million and expenses would have been lower by 8 million the net impact on yearoveryear results would have been a decrease in operating income of 12 million in fy21 

the results of operations in the table above and revenue by line of business product group and geographic region in the tables that follow present both actual percentage changes year over year and percentage changes on a constant currency basis 

revenue

our revenue results period to period are impacted by contract terms including the duration and start dates of our subscription contracts due to upfront recognition of subscription license revenue we are expanding our saas offerings and are releasing additional cloud functionality into our products as a 

 

result our revenue will be impacted over time as a higher portion of our sales will be from cloud services which are recognized ratably 

revenue by line of business

 



 





 

software revenue increased in fy’21 compared to fy’20 due to subscription revenue growth of 42 38 constant currency offset by an 18 decline in perpetual support revenue 21 constant currency due to conversions of perpetual support contracts to subscriptions arena acquired in the second quarter contributed approximately 29 million in fy’21 in fy’21 license revenue growth was primarily driven by contracts with longer durations 

professional services engagements typically result from sales of new licenses and software upgrades revenue is recognized over the term of the engagement our expectation is that professional services revenue will trend flattodown over time due to our strategy to expand margins by migrating more services engagements to our partners and delivering products that require less consulting and training services 

professional services revenue grew in fy’21 by 10 5 constant currency where fy’20 revenue was negatively impacted by the covid19 pandemic fy’21 benefited from increased delivery activity associated with plm deployments

revenue and arr by product group

 



core product software revenue growth in fy’21 compared to fy’20 was driven by subscription revenue growth of 39 34 constant currency offset by expected declines in perpetual support revenue of 20 23 constant currency due in part to ongoing perpetual support contract conversions to subscription 

arr increased 11 12 constant currency for fy’21 compared to fy’20 reflecting solid arr growth for both plm 13 actual14 constant currency and cad 10 actual and constant currency as customers pursue their digital transformation initiatives

growth product software revenue growth in fy’21 was driven by subscription revenue growth of 67 63 constant currency compared to the yearago period driven primarily by iot and contribution from arena 

growth product arr increased 50 actual and constant currency for fy’21 compared to fy’20 due in part to a 59 million contribution from arena excluding arena organic arr growth was 17 18 

 

constant currency reflecting 1 5  1 6  constant currency growth in iot and 16   actual and constant currency growth in ar 

fsg product software revenue growth in fy’21 compared to fy’20 was primarily driven by subscription revenue growth of 34 31 constant currency offset by a decline in perpetual support revenue of 15 17 constant currency due to conversions of perpetual support contracts to subscriptions 

fsg product arr increased 6 actual and constant currency for fy’21 compared to fy’20 

software revenue  arr by geographic region

a significant portion of our software revenue is generated outside the us in both fy’21 and fy’20 approximately 40 to 45 of software revenue was generated in the americas 35 to 40 in europe and 20 in asia pacific

 



 

americas software revenue growth in fy’21 was driven by growth in subscription revenue of 34 actual and constant currency as compared to fy’20  partially offset by a decline of 26 actual and constant currency in perpetual support revenue due to conversions of perpetual support contracts to subscriptions resulting in recurring revenue growth of 21 actual and constant currency 

americas arr was up 19 led by doubledigit growth in core products and arena 

europe software revenue growth in fy’21 was driven by growth in subscription revenue of 5 6 46 constant currency as compared to fy’20 partially offset by a decline of 16 21 constant currency in perpetual support revenue resulting in recurring revenue growth of 35 26 constant currency

arr in asia pacific was up 17 constant currency led by midteens growth in core products and low30s growth in growth products 

 

gross margin 

 



 



license gross margin increased in fy’21 compared to fy’20 due to subscription license revenue increasing significantly as a result of longer subscription term durations offset by increased royalty expense due to the mix of products sold and higher intangible amortization due to the arena acquisition 

support and cloud services gross margin percentage is flat in fy’21 compared to fy’20 while gross margin contribution increased from fy’20 to fy’21 reflecting an increase in subscription support and cloud revenue offset by a decrease in perpetual support revenue higher compensation costs and an increase in costs associated with our cloud services business due to greater demand for those services 

professional services gross margin increased in fy’21 compared to fy’20 primarily due to the impact of the covid19 pandemic on fy’20 resulting in a yearoveryear increase in revenue and lower travel costs in fy’21 partially offset by higher compensation and outside services costs 

 

operating expenses

 



 

total headcount increased by 75 in fy’21 to 6709 from 6243 at the end of fy’20 headcount at the end of fy’21 includes approximately 180 people from arena and other smaller acquisitions 

operating expenses in fy21 compared to fy20 increased primarily due to the following



 



 









 









partially offset by



stockbased compensation was higher in fy’21 compared to fy’20 primarily due to higher estimated attainment under performancebased incentive compensation and more timebased awards outstanding in fy’21 cash bonus expense was also higher in fy’21 compared to fy’20 due to higher attainment under the fy’21 bonus plan

interest expense

 



 

interest expense includes interest under our credit facility and senior notes interest expense was lower in fy’21 as fy’20 included 15 million of expense related to penalties for the early redemption of the 6000 senior notes due 2024 with higher balances in fy’21 partially offset by lower rates we had 1450 million of total debt at september 30 2021 compared to 1018 million at september 30 2020 for additional detail on the changes in our debt structure see note 9 debt  included in the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report

the average interest rate on our total borrowings was 33 in fy21 and 43 in fy20

other income expense

 



 

interest income represents earnings on the investment of our available cash and marketable securities

other expense net includes foreign currency gains and losses and other nonoperating gains and losses in fy’21 we recorded a 69 million nonoperating gain related to an equity investment in matterport inc which will continue to fluctuate foreign currency gains and losses include costs of hedging contracts certain realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains or losses and foreign exchange gains or losses resulting from the required periodend currency remeasurement of the assets and liabilities of our subsidiaries that use the us dollar as their functional currency 

 

income taxes 

 



 

  in fy’21 and fy’20 our tax rate differed from the us statutory federal income tax rate due to our corporate structure in which our foreign taxes are at a net effective tax rate lower than the us rate a significant amount of our foreign earnings is generated by our subsidiaries organized in ireland and the cayman islands in fy’21 and fy’20 the foreign rate differential predominantly relates to those earnings 

in fy’21 in addition to the foreign rate differential our tax rate differed from the statutory federal income tax rate due to the release of the valuation allowance on the majority of our us net deferred tax assets the net effects of the global intangible lowtaxed income gilti and foreign derived intangible income fdii regimes together referred to as us tax reform and the excess tax benefit related to stockbased compensation 

in fy’20 in addition to the foreign rate differential our tax rate differed from the statutory federal income tax rate due to us tax reform the excess tax benefit related to stockbased compensation and the indirect effects of the adoption of asc 606 additionally we recorded benefits for the reduction of the us valuation allowance as a result of the onshape acquisition a further reduction to the valuation allowance was also recorded to reflect the impact from the scheduling of the reversal of existing temporary differences resulting in deferred tax liabilities that cannot be offset against deferred tax assets 

our results for the twelve months ended september 30 2021 include a charge of 373 million related to the effects of a tax matter in the republic of korea south korea of 344 million and the resulting impact on us income taxes of 29 million the charge relates to an assessment with respect to various tax issues primarily foreign withholding taxes that was under appeal in south korea we received an assessment of approximately 12 million from the tax authorities in south korea in the fourth quarter of 2016 for the years 2011 to 2015 and paid the assessment in the first quarter of 2017 we appealed that assessment to an intermediate appellate court in december 2020 our appeal to that court  the seoul high court  was rejected we appealed this decision to the supreme court of the republic of korea in may 2021 the supreme court denied our request for a review of the case therefore the decision of the seoul high court was deemed final we made additional payments of approximately 20 million to the tax authorities in south korea in fy’21 for the years 2016 to 2021 in settlement of the amounts previously accrued

operating measure

arr

arr annual run rate represents the annualized value of our portfolio of active subscription software cloud saas and support contracts as of the end of the reporting period arr includes orders placed under our strategic alliance agreement with rockwell automation including orders placed to satisfy contractual minimum commitments

we believe arr is a valuable operating metric to measure the health of a subscription business because it captures expected subscription and support cash generation from customers because this measure represents the annualized value of customer contracts as of a point in time it does not represent revenue for any particular period or remaining revenue that will be recognized in future periods 

nongaap financial measures

the nongaap financial measures presented in the discussion of our results of operations and the respective most directly comparable gaap measures are



 











free cash flow is cash flow from operations net of capital expenditures which are expenditures for property and equipment and consist primarily of facility improvements office equipment computer equipment and software we believe that free cash flow in conjunction with cash from operations is a useful measure of liquidity since capital expenditures are a necessary component of ongoing operations

the nongaap financial measures other than free cash flow exclude as applicable stockbased compensation expense amortization of acquired intangible assets acquisitionrelated and other transactional charges included in general and administrative expenses restructuring and other charges net nonoperating charges and income tax adjustments

the items excluded from these nongaap financial measures are normally included in the comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with gaap our management excludes these items when evaluating our ongoing performance andor predicting our earnings trends and therefore excludes them when presenting nongaap financial measures management uses nongaap financial measures in conjunction with our gaap results as should investors

stockbased compensation is a noncash expense relating to stockbased awards issued to executive officers employees and outside directors consisting of restricted stock units we exclude this expense as it is a noncash expense and we assess our internal operations excluding this expense and believe it facilitates comparisons to the performance of other companies in our industry 

amortization of acquired intangible assets is a noncash expense that is impacted by the timing and magnitude of our acquisitions we believe the assessment of our operations excluding these costs is relevant to our assessment of internal operations and comparisons to the performance of other companies in our industry 

acquisitionrelated and other transactional charges included in general and administrative expenses are direct costs of potential and completed acquisitions and expenses related to acquisition integration activities including transaction fees due diligence costs severance and professional fees subsequent adjustments to our initial estimated amount of contingent consideration associated with specific acquisitions are also included within acquisitionrelated charges other transactional charges include thirdparty costs related to structuring unusual transactions we do not include these costs when reviewing our operating results internally the occurrence and amount of these costs will vary depending on the timing and size of acquisitions 

restructuring and other charges net includes excess facility restructuring charges credits impairment and accretion expense charges related to the lease assets of exited facilities sublease income from previously impaired facilities and severance costs resulting from reductions of personnel and thirdparty professional consulting fees related to modifications of our business strategy these costs may vary in size based on our restructuring plan 

nonoperating charges credits in q4’21 we recorded a 69 million gain related to our equity investment in matterport inc which will continue to fluctuate based on the market value of the investment in fy’20 we incurred an early redemption interest penalty and wrote off debt issuance costs both of which were related to the settlement of the 6000 senior notes due 2024 these items are excluded from our nongaap financial measures as they are nonordinary course in nature and not included in management’s review of our results 

 

income tax adjustments include the tax impact of the items above and assumes that we are profitable on a nongaap basis in the us and one foreign jurisdiction it also eliminates the effect of the valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets in those jurisdictions additionally we exclude other material tax items that we do not include when reviewing our operating results internally 

we use these nongaap financial measures and we believe that they assist our investors to make periodtoperiod comparisons of our operational performance because they provide a view of our operating results without items that are not in our view indicative of our core operating results we believe that these nongaap financial measures help illustrate underlying trends in our business and we use the measures to establish budgets and operational goals communicated internally and externally for managing our business and evaluating our performance we believe that providing nongaap financial measures also affords investors a view of our operating results that may be more easily compared to the results of other companies in our industry that use similar financial measures to supplement their gaap results

the items excluded from the nongaap financial measures often have a material impact on our financial results and such items often recur accordingly the nongaap financial measures included in this annual report should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for or superior to the comparable measures prepared in accordance with gaap the following tables reconcile each of these nongaap financial measures to its most closely comparable gaap measure on our financial statements

critical accounting policies and estimates

we have prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america in preparing our financial statements we make estimates assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our reported revenues results of operations and net income as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet these estimates assumptions and judgments are made based on our historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances these estimates may change as new events occur or additional information is obtained and we may periodically be faced with uncertainties the outcomes of which are not within our control and may not be known for a prolonged period of time

the accounting policies methods and estimates used to prepare our financial statements are described generally in note 2 summary of significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report the most important accounting judgments and estimates that we made in preparing the financial statements involved







a critical accounting policy is one that is both material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires us to make subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies require us to make assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time of the estimate and different estimates that we could have used or changes in the estimates that are reasonably likely to occur may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process actual results could differ from those estimates

accounting policies guidelines and interpretations related to our critical accounting policies and estimates are generally subject to numerous sources of authoritative guidance and are often reexamined by accounting standards rule makers and regulators these rule makers andor regulators may promulgate interpretations guidance or regulations that may result in changes to our accounting policies which could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations

 

revenue recognition 

we record revenues in accordance with the guidance provided by asc 606 revenue from contracts with customers  for a full description of our revenue accounting policy refer to note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  included in the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report

our sources of revenue include 1 subscriptions 2 perpetual licenses 3 support for perpetual licenses and 4 professional services subscriptions include termbased onpremises licenses softwareasaservice saas and hosting services 

judgments and estimates

determination of performance obligations our subscriptions are frequently sold as a bundle of products and services typically pairing onpremises term software licenses with support andor cloud services over the same term onpremises software is typically determined to be a distinct performance obligation and is thus recognized separately from the support andor cloud components onpremises license software revenue is generally recognized at the point in time that the software is made available to the customer while the support and cloud software revenue components are recognized over the term of the contract in cases where subscriptions include cloud functionality and onpremises software an assessment has been performed to determine whether the cloud services are distinct from the onpremises software in the substantial majority of instances cloud services provide incremental functionality to customers and have been considered distinct and recognized separately from the onpremises software this assessment could have a significant impact on the timing of revenue recognition and may change as our product offerings evolve 

allocation of transaction price we estimate the standalone selling price of each identified performance obligation and use that estimate to allocate the transaction price among said performance obligations the estimated standalone selling price is determined using all information reasonably available to us including market conditions and other observable inputs significant judgment is used in determining the standalone selling prices of the onpremises license support and cloud components of our subscription products these estimates are subject to change as our product offerings change and could have a significant impact due to the difference in the timing of revenue recognition for onpremises licenses and support andor cloud 

right to exchange our multiyear noncancellable onpremises subscription contracts provide customers with an annual right to exchange software within the original subscription with other software we account for this right as a refund liability for most contracts we use the expected value method to determine the refund liability associated with this right across a portfolio of contracts where contracts are outside of the standard portfolio of contracts due to contract size longer contract duration or other unique contractual terms we use the most likely amount method to determine the refund liability for each individual contract in both circumstances the transaction price is constrained based on our estimates which impacts the amount of revenue recognized changes in these estimates could significantly impact revenue for any given period 

accounting for income taxes

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to calculate our income tax expense based on taxable income by jurisdiction there are many transactions and calculations about which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain as a result our calculations involve estimates by management some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenuesharing costreimbursement and transfer pricing arrangements among related entities and the differing tax treatment of revenue and cost items across various jurisdictions if we were compelled to revise or to account differently for our arrangements that revision could affect our recorded tax liabilities

the income tax accounting process also involves estimating our actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheets we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be 

 

recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized we must establish a valuation allowance as a charge to income tax expense 

as of september 30 2021 we have a valuation allowance of 177 million against net deferred tax assets in the us and a valuation allowance of 344 million against net deferred tax assets in certain foreign jurisdictions we have concluded based on the weight of available evidence that a full valuation allowance is no longer required against our us net deferred tax assets as they are more likely than not to be realized in the future we will continue to reassess our valuation allowance requirements each financial reporting period

the valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets of certain foreign jurisdictions is established primarily for our capital loss carryforwards the majority of which do not expire however there are limitations imposed on the utilization of such capital losses that could further restrict the recognition of any tax benefits

prior to the passage of the us tax act the company asserted that substantially all of the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries were considered indefinitely invested and accordingly no deferred taxes were provided pursuant to the provisions of the us tax act these earnings were subjected to a onetime transition tax and there is therefore no longer a material cumulative basis difference associated with the undistributed earnings we maintain our assertion to permanently reinvest these earnings outside the us unless repatriation can be done substantially taxfree with the exception of a foreign holding company formed in 2018 and our taiwan subsidiary if we decide to repatriate any additional nonus earnings in the future we may be required to establish a deferred tax liability on such earnings the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability on the undistributed earnings would not be material

in the normal course of business ptc and its subsidiaries are examined by various taxing authorities including the internal revenue service irs in the us we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate we are currently under audit by tax authorities in several jurisdictions audits by tax authorities typically involve examination of the deductibility of certain permanent items transfer pricing limitations on net operating losses and tax credits although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in material changes in our estimates

valuation of assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations

in accordance with business combination accounting we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values determining these fair values requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets

our identifiable intangible assets acquired consist of developed technology core technology tradenames customer lists and contracts and software support agreements and related relationships developed technology consists of products that have reached technological feasibility core technology represents a combination of processes inventions and trade secrets related to the design and development of acquired products customer lists and contracts and software support agreements and related relationships represent the underlying relationships and agreements with customers of the acquired company’s installed base we have generally valued intangible assets using a discounted cash flow model critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to





in addition we estimate the useful lives of our intangible assets based upon the expected period over which we anticipate generating economic benefits from the related intangible asset

 

net tangible assets consist of the fair values of tangible assets less the fair values of assumed liabilities and obligations except for deferred revenues net tangible assets were generally valued by us at the respective carrying amounts recorded by the acquired company if we believed that their carrying values approximated their fair values at the acquisition date the values assigned to deferred revenue reflect an amount equivalent to the estimated cost plus an appropriate profit margin to perform the services related to the acquired company’s software support contracts 

in addition uncertain tax positions and taxrelated valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date and we reevaluate these items quarterly with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill provided that we are within the measurement period up to one year from the acquisition date and we continue to collect information in order to determine their estimated values subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the estimated value of uncertain tax positions or taxrelated valuation allowances whichever comes first changes to these uncertain tax positions and taxrelated valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of operations

our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable at that time but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions estimates or actual results

when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a finitelived intangible asset may not be recoverable we perform an assessment of the asset for potential impairment this assessment is based on projected undiscounted future cash flows over the asset’s remaining life if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its undiscounted cash flows we record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset determined using projected discounted future cash flows of the asset

liquidity and capital resources

 



 

cash cash equivalents and restricted cash

we invest our cash with highly rated financial institutions and in diversified domestic and international money market mutual funds cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at september 30 2021 cash and cash equivalents totaled 327 million compared to 275 million at september 30 2020

a significant portion of our cash is generated and held outside the us as of september 30 2021 we had cash and cash equivalents of 37 million in the us 111 million in europe 145 million in asia pacific including india and 34 million in other nonus countries all our marketable securities are held in the us we have substantial cash requirements in the us but we believe that the combination of our existing us cash and cash equivalents marketable securities our ability to repatriate cash to the us more cost effectively future us operating cash flows and cash available under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our ongoing us operating expenses and known capital requirements

cash provided by operating activities

cash provided by operating activities was 369 million in fy21 compared to 234 million in fy20 the yearoveryear increase is primarily due to approximately 190 million of higher cash collections and 20 

 

million in contribution from arena offset by 80 million more in salary and salaryrelated payment and an 18 million foreign tax payment  

restructuring payments totaled 14 million in fy’21 compared to 42 million in fy’20 cash paid for income taxes was 58 million in fy’21 compared to 53 million in fy’20

cash used in investing activities

 



 

cash used in investing activities reflects 718 million used for acquisitions in fy’21 primarily related to arena compared to 483 million in fy’20 469 million of which related to onshape for additional detail on our acquisitions see note 6 acquisitions  included in the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report our expenditures for property and equipment consist primarily of facility improvements office equipment computer equipment and software

cash provided by financing activities

 



 

fy’21 net borrowings of 432 million were primarily used to fund the arena acquisition fy’20 net borrowings were primarily related to the acquisition of onshape fy’20 net borrowings reflect the issuance of 1 billion in new notes in february 2020 and the repayment of 500 million of earlier issued notes in may 2020 as well as net repayments of 155 million under our revolving credit facility 

outstanding debt

as of september 30 2021 we had

 



 

as of september 30 2021 we were in compliance with all financial and operating covenants of the credit facility and the note indentures any failure to comply with such covenants under the credit facility would prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under the credit facility and as with any 

 

failure to comply with such covenants under the note indentures could constitute a default that could cause all amounts outstanding to become due and payable immediately 

our credit facility and our senior notes are described in note 9 debt to the condensed consolidated financial statements in this form 10k

share repurchase authorization

our articles of organization authorize us to issue up to 500 million shares of our common stock our board of directors has authorized us to repurchase up to 1 billion of our common stock through september 30 2023 we may use cash from operations and borrowings under our credit facility to make any such repurchases all shares of our common stock repurchased are automatically restored to the status of authorized and unissued

in fy’21 we repurchased approximately 226 thousand shares in the open market for 30 million we did not repurchase any shares in fy’20

expectations for fiscal 2022

we believe that existing cash and cash equivalents together with cash generated from operations and amounts available under the credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements which we expect to be approximately 30 million in fy’22 through at least the next twelve months and to meet our known longterm capital requirements in fy’22 we expect to pay approximately 50 million to 55 million in restructuring cash payments related to our recently announced restructuring charge as well as previous restructuring charges in fy’22 we expect to return approximately 25 of our estimated free cash flow excluding restructuring payments which is expected to be approximately 450 million to our shareholders through stock repurchases of our common stock

our expected uses and sources of cash could change our cash position could be reduced and we could incur additional debt obligations if we decide to retire debt engage in strategic transactions or repurchase shares any of which could be commenced suspended or completed at any time any such repurchases or retirement of debt will depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors the amounts involved in any debt retirement or issuance share repurchases or strategic transactions may be material

contractual obligations

at september 30 2021 our future contractual obligations were related to debt leases pension liabilities unrecognized tax benefits and purchase obligations see note 9 debt note 19 leases note 14 pension plans and note 8 income taxes of notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report for information about those obligations which notes are incorporated by reference into this section our purchase obligations were approximately 904 million with 437 million expected to be paid in fy’22 and 468 million thereafter purchase obligations represent minimum commitments due to third parties including royalty contracts research and development contracts telecommunication contracts information technology maintenance contracts in support of internaluse software and hardware financing leases operating leases with original terms of less than 12 months and other marketing and consulting contracts contracts for which our commitment is variable based on volumes with no fixed minimum quantities and contracts that can be canceled without payment penalties are not included in the purchase obligation amounts above the purchase obligations included above are in addition to amounts included in current liabilities and prepaid expenses recorded on our september 30 2021 consolidated balance sheet

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

tableend

we face exposure to financial market risks including adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results

foreign currency exchange risk

our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to western european countries japan israel china and canada we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates that arise from receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies we do not enter into or hold foreign currency derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes nor do we enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge future cash flows or forecast transactions

our nonus revenues generally are transacted through our nonus subsidiaries and typically are denominated in their local currency in addition expenses that are incurred by our nonus subsidiaries typically are denominated in their local currency approximately 60 of our revenue and 40 of our expenses were transacted in currencies other than the us dollar currency translation affects our reported results because we report our results of operations in us dollars historically our most significant currency risk has been changes in the euro and japanese yen relative to the us dollar based on current revenue and expense levels excluding restructuring charges and stockbased compensation a 010 change in the usd to eur exchange rate and a 10 yen change in the yen to usd exchange rate would impact operating income by approximately 28 million and 10 million respectively

our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations arises in part from intercompany transactions with most intercompany transactions occurring between a us dollar functional currency entity and a foreign currency denominated entity intercompany transactions typically are denominated in the local currency of the nonus dollar functional currency subsidiary in order to centralize foreign currency risk also both ptc the parent company and our nonus subsidiaries may transact business with our customers and vendors in a currency other than their functional currency transaction risk in addition we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results and balances of our nonus subsidiaries are translated into us dollars translation risk if sales to customers outside of the united states increase our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will increase

our foreign currency risk management strategy is principally designed to mitigate the future potential financial impact of changes in the us dollar value of balances denominated in foreign currency resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates our foreign currency hedging program uses forward contracts to manage the foreign currency exposures that exist as part of our ongoing business operations the contracts are primarily denominated in japanese yen and european currencies and have maturities of less than three months

generally we do not designate foreign currency forward contracts as hedges for accounting purposes and changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized immediately in earnings 

 

because we enter into forward contracts only as an economic hedge any gain or loss on the underlying foreigndenominated balance would be offset by the loss or gain on the forward contract gains and losses on forward contracts and foreign currency denominated receivables and payables are included in foreign currency net losses 

as of september 30 2021 and 2020 we had outstanding forward contracts for derivatives not designated as hedging instruments with notional amounts equivalent to the following 

 



 

debt

in addition to the 1 billion due under our 2025 and 2028 senior notes as of september 30 2021 we had 450 million outstanding under our credit facility loans under the credit facility bear interest at variable rates which reset every 30 to 180 days depending on the rate and period selected by us these loans are subject to interest rate risk as interest rates will be adjusted at each rollover date to the extent such amounts are not repaid as of september 30 2021 the annual rate on the credit facility loans was 169 if there were a hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates the annual net impact to earnings and cash flows would be 45 million this hypothetical change in cash flows and earnings has been calculated based on the borrowings outstanding at september 30 2021 and a 100 basis point per annum change in interest rate applied over a oneyear period

cash and cash equivalents

as of september 30 2021 cash equivalents were invested in highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased we invest our cash with highly rated financial institutions in north america europe and asia pacific and in diversified domestic and international money market mutual funds at september 30 2021 we had cash and cash equivalents of 37 million in the united states 111 million in europe 145 million in asia pacific including india and 34 million in other nonus countries given the short maturities and investment grade quality of the portfolio holdings at september 30 2021 a hypothetical 10 change in interest rates would not materially affect the fair value of our cash and cash equivalents

our invested cash is subject to interest rate fluctuations and for nonus operations foreign currency risk in a declining interest rate environment we would experience a decrease in interest income the opposite holds true in a rising interest rate environment over the past several years the us federal reserve board european central bank and bank of england have changed certain benchmark interest rates which has led to declines and increases in market interest rates these changes in market interest rates have resulted in fluctuations in interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents interest income will continue to fluctuate based on changes in market interest rates and levels of cash available for investment changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar had an unfavorable impact of 01 million and 26 million on our consolidated cash balances in 2021 and 2019 respectively in particular due to changes in the euro and the japanese yen and an immaterial impact in 2020

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures

our management maintains disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the exchange act is processed recorded summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer our principal executive officer and principal financial officer respectively as appropriate to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure

as required by sec rule 15d15b we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of management including our principal executive and principal financial officers of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this annual report based on this evaluation we concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of september 30 2021

management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate

our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of september 30 2021 using the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal controlintegrated framework 2013  based on this assessment 

 

and those criteria our management concluded that as of september 30 2021  our internal control over financial reporting was effective 

management excluded arena from our assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of september 30 2021 because the company acquired it in a business combination in 2021 arena’s total assets and total revenues represent approximately 1 and 2 respectively of the company’s total assets and total revenues as of and for the year ended september 30 2021

our markets and how we address them

we compete in the iiot ar cad and plm markets the markets we serve present different growth opportunities for us we see greater opportunity for market growth for our iiot and ar solutions for the enterprise followed by more moderate market growth for our cad and plm solutions

we derive most of our sales from products and services sold directly by our sales force to enduser customers approximately 30 to 35 of our sales of products and services are through thirdparty resellers our sales force focuses on large accounts while our reseller channel provides a costeffective means of covering the small and mediumsize business market our strategic services partners provide service offerings to help customers implement our product offerings as we grow our iiot business we expect that our gotomarket strategy will rely more on selling through partners including the types of strategic partners described above and marketing directly to end users and developers

 item 1a 

risk factors

tableend

the following are important factors we have identified that could affect our future results and your investment in our securities you should consider them carefully when evaluating an investment in ptc securities or any forwardlooking statements made by us including those contained in this annual report because these factors could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or the performance projected in forwardlooking statements the risks described below are not the only risks we face additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business financial condition andor operating results 

i risks related to our business operations and industry 

we face significant competition which may reduce our profitability and limit or reduce our market share

the markets for our products and solutions are rapidly changing and characterized by intense competition disruptive technology developments evolving distribution models and increasingly lower barriers to entry if we are unable to provide products and solutions that address customers’ needs as well as our competitors’ products and solutions do or to align our pricing licensing and delivery models with customer preferences we could lose customers andor fail to attract new customers which could cause us to lose revenue and market share

for example the covid19 pandemic has caused companies worldwide to close their offices and their employees to have to work remotely from their homes which has focused companies on the need for solutions that empower and support remote work by employees we believe customers and potential customers will increasingly seek software solutions that support remote work by employees although many of our solutions support remote work others are less efficient at doing so we have embarked on an effort to make our solutions available on a saas platform however this will require significant effort and investment and we cannot be sure that we will be able to make our solutions available as saas solutions as quickly as we expect if we are unable to compete successfully with competitors offering saas solutions we could lose customers andor fail to attract new customers which could cause us to lose revenue and market share which would adversely affect our business and financial results

in addition competitive pressures could cause us to reduce our prices which could reduce our revenue and margins

finally our current and potential competitors range from large and wellestablished companies to emerging startups some of our competitors and potential competitors have greater name recognition in the markets we serve and greater financial technical sales and marketing and other resources which could limit our ability to gain customer recognition and confidence in our products and solutions and successfully sell our products and solutions which could adversely affect our ability to grow our business

a breach of security in our products or computer systems or those of our thirdparty service providers could compromise the integrity of our products cause loss of data harm our reputation create additional liability and adversely impact our financial results

we have implemented and continue to implement measures intended to maintain the security and integrity of our products source code and computer systems the potential for a security breach or system disruption has significantly increased over time as the scope number intensity and sophistication of attempted cyberattacks and cyberintrusions have increased we face cyberattacks and intrusions designed to access and exfiltrate information and to disrupt and lockup access to systems for the purpose of demanding a ransom payment despite efforts to create security barriers to such threats it is impossible for us to eliminate the risk of a successful cyberattack or intrusion and in fact we deal with security issues on a regular basis and have experienced security incidents from time to time accordingly there is a risk that a cyberattack or intrusion will be successful and that such event will be material

in addition we offer cloud services to our customers and some of our products are hosted by thirdparty service providers which expose us to additional risks as those repositories of our customers’ proprietary data may be targeted and a cyberattack or intrusion may be successful and material

 

a significant breach of the security andor integrity of our products or systems or those of our thirdparty service providers could prevent our products from functioning properly could enable access to sensitive proprietary or confidential information including that of our customers or could disrupt our business operations or those of our customers this could require us to incur significant costs of investigation remediation andor payment of a ransom harm our reputation  cause customers to stop buying our products  and cause us to face lawsuits and potential liability which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

we may be unable to hire or retain personnel with the necessary skills to operate and grow our business which could adversely affect our ability to compete

our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial sales and marketing technical financial and administrative personnel to operate and grow our business competition for such personnel in our industry is intense particularly in the boston massachusetts area where our global headquarters is located

the technical personnel required to develop our products and solutions are in high demand particularly technical personnel with augmented and virtual reality and analytics expertise as there are comparatively fewer persons with those skills if we are unable to attract and retain technical personnel with the requisite skills our product and solution development efforts could be delayed which could adversely affect our ability to compete and thereby adversely affect our revenues and profitability

the managerial sales and marketing financial and administrative personnel necessary to guide our operations market and sell our solutions and support our business operations are also in high demand due to the intense competition in our industry

if we are unable to attract and retain the personnel we need to develop compelling products and solutions and guide operate and support our business we may be unable to successfully compete in the marketplace which would adversely affect our revenues and profitability

the extent to which the novel coronavirus covid19 may impact our business is uncertain and it could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

the covid19 pandemic has significantly impacted global economic activity and has created macroeconomic uncertainty public and private sector policies and initiatives to reduce the transmission of covid19 such as the imposition of travel restrictions temporary closures of businesses and the adoption of remote working have significantly changed the way we and our customers work the effects and duration of this disruption remain uncertain 

while ptc was able to transition to remote working without significant disruption to our daytoday operations disruption to our customers’ and our prospects’ operations and the way we work with them have adversely affected our business

demand for our solutions has declined and could decline further due to challenges associated with conducting inperson sales meetings and project scoping and implementation activities while social distancing measures are in place which has deterred or prevented and could further deter or prevent customers from proceeding with new software purchases and deployments likewise temporary plant closures layoffs and furloughs at our customers and the challenges they face forecasting business needs in this time of global economic uncertainty have caused and could continue to cause our customers to delay or reduce new license purchases 

longer term plant closures and layoffs among our customer base could cause existing subscription customers to renew fewer existing licenses when their subscriptions come up for renewal and could cause existing support customers to discontinue support at the time of renewal we experienced an increase in churn in fy’20 to 86 versus a churn rate of 74 for fy’19 if churn increases in the future our arr and financial results and condition could be negatively impacted 

reductions in new license sales andor renewals and in professional services delivered could reduce our arr growth or cause our arr to decline and would reduce our professional services revenue all of 

 

which would adversely affect our revenue earnings and cash flow further prolonged disruption could continue to negatively impact the businesses of our customers and prospective customers and therefore our business and financial condition 

the economic uncertainty caused by the covid19 pandemic has also caused our customers to focus on their liquidity this focus on liquidity or our customers’ lack of liquidity could adversely affect our cash flows if we make concessions in the amount or timing of payments due from customers or if our customers do not pay when or as expected moreover some of our resellers may face liquidity challenges which could adversely affect our cash flows if they do not pay us when or as expected 

if our business declines due to the above we could be required to reduce our expenses which could result in material restructuring charges andor reduce or delay investments in our business including hiring reductions in our workforce andor investments in our business could hamper our ability to recover and compete successfully which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

finally while we expect to have sufficient liquidity with cash on hand cash generated from operations and amounts available under our credit facility to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements through at least the next twelve months and our known longterm capital requirements declines in cash flows could adversely affect our liquidity and we may be unable to draw on our credit facility as we expect due to covenants under the credit facility if our liquidity is significantly impaired it would significantly adversely affect our business due to our inability to pay our suppliers and our employees further a significant liquidity impairment could cause us to be unable to make the required periodic interest payments due on our outstanding senior notes due 2028 and 2025 which would constitute an event of default under the applicable notes and cause the aggregate principal amount of those notes on which we defaulted to become due and payable

we depend on sales within the discrete manufacturing sector and our business could be adversely affected if manufacturing activity does not grow or if it contracts or if manufacturers are adversely affected by other economic factors

a large amount of our sales are to customers in the discrete manufacturing sector the global manufacturing purchasing managers index pmi declined significantly in the second and third quarters of 2020 due to the impact of covid19 and though it has recovered somewhat remained approximately at the 50 level in september 2020 although the volatility in manufacturing pmi did not have a significant adverse effect on our business in fy’20 if the manufacturing sector does not improve or continues to decline our customers in this sector may as they have in the past reduce or defer purchases of our products and services which could adversely affect our financial results

in addition manufacturers worldwide are facing increasing uncertainty about the global economic climate due to among other factors the covid19 pandemic the geopolitical environment and ongoing trade tensions and tariffs in addition within the technology industry the us administration’s focus on technology transactions with nonus entities and potential expanded prohibitions has created additional uncertainty in light of these concerns and challenges including the potential enactment or expansion of laws that restrict our ability to sell our solutions to customers customers may delay reduce or forego purchases of our solutions which would adversely affect our business and financial results

if we fail to successfully manage our transition to a subscriptionbased licensing company our business and financial results could be adversely affected

we completed our transition from offering perpetual licenses for our products to offering only subscriptionbased licenses worldwide in january 2019 excluding kepware while we expect our subscription base recurring revenue and cash flow to increase over time as a result of this licensing model transition our ability to achieve these financial objectives is subject to risks and uncertainties becoming a subscriptionbased licensing company requires a considerable investment of technical financial legal and sales resources and a scalable organization whether our transition will be successful and will accomplish our business and financial objectives is subject to uncertainties including but not limited to customer demand attach and renewal rates channel acceptance our ability to further develop and scale infrastructure our ability to include functionality and usability in such offerings that address customer 

 

requirements and our costs if we are unable to successfully establish these new offerings and navigate our business transition due to the foregoing risks and uncertainties our business and financial results could be adversely impacted 

because our sales and operations are globally dispersed we face additional compliance risks and any compliance risk could adversely affect our business and financial results

we sell and deliver software and services and maintain support operations in many countries whose laws and practices differ from one another and are subject to unexpected changes managing these geographically dispersed operations requires significant attention and resources to ensure compliance with laws of those countries and those of the us governing our activities in nonus countries

those laws include but are not limited to anticorruption laws and regulations including the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and the uk bribery act 2010 data privacy laws and regulations including the european unions general data privacy regulation and trade and economic sanctions laws and regulations including laws administered by the us department of the treasury’s office of foreign assets control the us state department the us department of commerce the united nations security council and other relevant sanctions authorities our compliance risks are heightened due to the gotomarket approach for our business that relies heavily on a partner ecosystem the fact that we operate in and are expanding into countries with a higher incidence of corruption and fraudulent business practices than others the fact that we deal with governments and stateowned business enterprises and the fact that global enforcement of laws has significantly increased

accordingly while we strive to maintain a comprehensive compliance program we cannot guarantee that an employee agent or business partner will not act in violation of our policies or us or other applicable laws or that we may inadvertently violate such laws investigations of alleged violations of those laws can be expensive and disruptive violations of such laws can lead to civil andor criminal prosecutions substantial fines and other sanctions including the revocation of our rights to continue certain operations and also cause business and reputation loss which could adversely affect our financial results andor stock price

ii risks related to acquisitions and strategic relationships

businesses we acquire may not generate the revenue and earnings we anticipate and may otherwise adversely affect our business

we have acquired and intend to continue to acquire new businesses and technologies if we fail to successfully integrate and manage the businesses and technologies we acquire if an acquisition does not further our business strategy as we expect or if a business we acquire has unexpected legal or financial liabilities our operating results will be adversely affected

the types of issues that we may face in integrating and operating the acquired business include









 



further if we do not achieve the expected return on our investments it could impair the intangible assets and goodwill that we recorded as part of an acquisition which could require us to record a reduction to the value of those assets

we may incur significant debt or issue a material amount of debt or equity securities to finance an acquisition which could adversely affect our operating flexibility and financial statements

if we were to incur a significant amount of debt—whether by borrowing funds or issuing new debt securities—to finance an acquisition our interest expense debt service requirements and leverage would increase significantly the increases in these expenses and in our leverage could adversely impact our ability to operate the company as we might otherwise and to borrow additional amounts

if we were to issue a significant amount of equity securities in connection with an acquisition existing stockholders would be diluted and earnings per share could decrease

our inability to maintain or develop our strategic and technology relationships could adversely affect our business

we have many strategic and technology relationships with other companies with which we work to offer complementary solutions and services that market and sell our solutions and that provide technologies that we embed in our solutions we may not realize the expected benefits from these relationships and such relationships may be terminated by the other party if these companies fail to perform or if a company terminates or substantially alters the terms of the relationship we could suffer delays in product development reduced sales or other operational difficulties and our business results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected

iii risks related to our intellectual property

we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights which could adversely affect our business and our ability to compete effectively

our software products are proprietary we protect our intellectual property rights in these items by relying on copyrights trademarks patents and common law safeguards including trade secret protection as well as restrictions on disclosures and transferability contained in our agreements with other parties despite these measures the laws of all relevant jurisdictions may not afford adequate protection to our products and other intellectual property in addition we frequently encounter attempts by individuals and companies to pirate our software if our measures to protect our intellectual property rights fail others may be able to use those rights which could reduce our competitiveness and revenues

in addition any legal action to protect our intellectual property rights that we may bring or be engaged in could be costly may distract management from daytoday operations and may lead to additional claims against us and we may not succeed all of which would materially adversely affect our operating results

intellectual property infringement claims could be asserted against us which could be expensive to defend and could result in limitations on our use of the claimed intellectual property

the software industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding copyright patent and other intellectual property rights if a lawsuit of this type is filed it could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel we cannot be sure that we would prevail against any such asserted claims if we did not prevail we could be prevented from using the claimed intellectual property or be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements which might not be available on terms acceptable to us in addition to possible claims with respect to our proprietary products some of our products contain technology developed by and licensed from third parties and we may likewise be susceptible to infringement claims with respect to these thirdparty technologies

 

iv risks related to our indebtedness 

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations as well as our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt

we have a significant amount of indebtedness as of november 20 2020 our total debt outstanding was approximately 10 billion all of which was associated with the 3625 senior notes and 4000 senior notes together “senior notes” issued february 2020 which mature in february 2025 and 2028 respectively and are unsecured all amounts outstanding under the credit facility and the senior notes will be due and payable in full on their respective maturity dates as of november 20 2020 we had unused commitments under our credit facility of 10 billion ptc inc and one of our foreign subsidiaries are eligible borrowers under the credit facility and certain other foreign subsidiaries may become borrowers under our credit facility in the future subject to certain conditions

specifically our level of debt could



















any of the abovelisted factors could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt agreements

despite our current level of indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur substantially more debt and other obligations this could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition described above

we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness and other obligations in the future including secured debt although the credit agreement governing our credit facility contains restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions the additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial in addition the credit agreement and the indenture governing the senior notes will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness if new debt is added to our current debt levels or we incur other obligations the related risks that we now face could intensify 

 

we may not be able to generate enough cash to service all our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness which may not be successful 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business legislative regulatory and other factors some of which are beyond our control we may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness we may not be able to effect any such alternative measures if necessary on commercially reasonable terms or at all and even if successful those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations our debt agreements restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due

our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all would materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations and our ability to satisfy our debt obligations

if we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt we will be in default and the lenders under our credit facility could terminate their commitments to loan money the lenders could foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings the holders of our senior notes could declare all outstanding principal premium if any and interest to be due and payable and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation these events could result in a loss of your investment

we are required to comply with certain financial and operating covenants under our debt agreements any failure to comply with those covenants could cause amounts borrowed to become immediately due and payable andor prevent us from borrowing under the credit facility

we are required to comply with specified financial and operating covenants under our debt agreements and to make payments under our debt which limit our ability to operate our business as we otherwise might operate it our failure to comply with any of these covenants or to meet any debt payment obligations could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived would result in any amounts outstanding including any accrued interest andor unpaid fees becoming immediately due and payable we might not have enough working capital or liquidity to satisfy any repayment obligations if those obligations were accelerated in addition if we are not in compliance with the financial and operating covenants under the credit facility when we wish to borrow funds we will be unable to borrow funds

in addition the financial and operating covenants under the credit facility may limit our ability to borrow funds including for strategic acquisitions and share repurchases

 

our credit facility has variable interest tied to libor and we could become subject to higher interest rates if the replacement rate we agree on with our banks is higher 

borrowings under our revolving credit facility use the london interbank offering rate libor as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate libor is the subject of recent national international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform these reforms and other pressures may cause libor to disappear entirely or to perform differently than in the past although we believe the recent discussions about alternative rates will not materially increase the interest rates on our credit facility the final agreed rate may increase the cost of our variable rate indebtedness

v risks related to our common stock

our operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter making future operating results difficult to predict failure to meet market expectations could cause the price of our securities to decline

our quarterly operating results historically have fluctuated and are likely to continue to fluctuate depending on many factors including















accordingly our quarterly results are difficult to predict prior to the end of the quarter and we may be unable to confirm or adjust expectations with respect to our operating results for a quarter until that quarter has closed any failure to meet our quarterly revenue or earnings expectations could adversely impact the market price of our securities

our stock price has been volatile which may make it harder to resell shares at a favorable time and price

market prices for securities of software companies are generally volatile and are subject to significant fluctuations that may be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies further our stock price has been more volatile than that of other software companies accordingly the trading prices and valuations of software companies’ stocks and of ours may not be predictable negative changes in the public’s perception of the prospects of software companies or of ptc or the markets we serve could depress our stock price regardless of our operating results

 

also a large percentage of our common stock is held by institutional investors and by rockwell automation purchases and sales of our common stock by these investors could have a significant impact on the market price of the stock for more information about those investors please see our proxy statement with respect to our most recent annual meeting of stockholders and schedules 13d and 13g filed with the sec with respect to our common stock 

vi risks related to our senior notes

our senior notes are unsecured and do not limit our ability to incur indebtedness which could reduce any payments to holders of the senior notes in connection with any insolvency liquidation reorganization dissolution or other winding up of ptc

unlike the credit facility which is secured the senior notes are not secured although the indenture governing the senior notes limits our ability to incur secured debt the covenant is subject to significant exceptions and we may incur additional secured debt in the future the effect of this subordination is that upon a default in payment on or the acceleration of any of our secured indebtedness or in the event of bankruptcy insolvency liquidation dissolution or reorganization of our company collectively “adverse events” the proceeds from the sale of assets securing our secured indebtedness will be available to pay obligations on the senior notes only after all indebtedness under the credit facility and any other secured debt has been paid in full as a result the holders of the senior notes may receive less ratably than the holders of secured debt if an adverse event occurs

in addition the indenture governing the senior notes does not limit our ability to incur unsecured indebtedness if we incur any additional indebtedness that ranks equally with the senior notes subject to collateral arrangements the holders of that debt will be entitled to share ratably with holders of the senior notes in any proceeds distributed in connection with any of the adverse events described above this may reduce the amount of proceeds to holders of the senior notes 

our senior notes are not guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries which could adversely affect our ability to pay interest on or redeem the senior notes when due

we conduct a substantial portion of our operations through our subsidiaries none of which currently guarantees the senior notes accordingly payment of interest on the senior notes and redemption of the senior notes is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend debt repayment or otherwise unless they become guarantors of the senior notes our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on the senior notes or to make funds available for that purpose our subsidiaries may not be able to or may not be permitted to make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of the senior notes each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries if we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries we may be unable to make required payments of principal premium if any and interest on the senior notes

our senior notes are not listed on any national securities exchange or included in any automated quotation system which could make it harder to resell the notes at a favorable time and price

our senior notes are not listed on any national securities exchange or included in any automated quotation system as a result an active market for the notes may not exist or be maintained which would adversely affect the market price and liquidity of the notes in that case holders may not be able to sell their notes when they want to or at a favorable price

the market for noninvestment grade debt historically has been subject to severe disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the notes the market if any for the notes may experience similar disruptions and any such disruptions may adversely affect the liquidity in that market or the prices at which the notes may be sold

 

vii general risk factors 

our international businesses present economic and operating risks which could adversely affect our business and financial results

we expect that our international operations will continue to expand and to account for a significant portion of our total revenue because we transact business in various foreign currencies the volatility of foreign exchange rates has had and may in the future have a material adverse effect on our revenue expenses and operating results

other risks inherent in our international operations include but are not limited to the following











we may have exposure to additional tax liabilities and our effective tax rate may increase or fluctuate which could increase our income tax expense and reduce our net income

as a multinational organization we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes in the us and in various foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision and other tax liabilities in the ordinary course of a global business there are many intercompany transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain our tax returns are subject to review by various taxing authorities although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes could be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals for example we have an open tax dispute in south korea with respect to which we paid 12 million in 2017 to accommodate the potential tax liability through 2015 which we are disputing if we do not prevail in that challenge we could be subject to additional liabilities for periods after 2015 which we estimate could be 17 million

our effective tax rate can be adversely affected by several factors many of which are outside of our control including

executive overview

arr increased 14 to 1270 million 11 and 1236 million constant currency compared to the end of fy’19 arr growth was strong in our much larger core business and accelerated in our growth business but declined modestly in our focused solutions group fsg business churn of 86 was slightly higher than expected 

fy’20 revenue of 146 billion increased 16 year over year driven by 26 recurring revenue growth due in part to the adoption of asc 606 and related business policy changes in q4’20 contract durations were slightly longer than forecasted and we had a higher than anticipated number of conversions both of which positively impacted the amount of upfront subscription revenue recognized in the quarter fy’20 operating margin of 14 increased approximately 900 basis points and eps increased significantly year over year due to the increase in revenue and a decrease in the effective tax rate primarily due to a reduction of the us valuation allowance

we generated 234 million of cash from operations in fy20 compared to 285 million in fy19 primarily due to higher interest and restructuring payments in the year we ended fy’20 with 335 million of cash and marketable securities and 10 billion of debt outstanding including 1 billion of senior notes with a weighted average cost of debt of 38 and 18 million outstanding under our credit facility which was paid down subsequent to year end

impact of foreign currency exchange on results of operations

approximately 60 of our revenue and 40 of our expenses are transacted in currencies other than the us dollar because we report our results of operations in us dollars currency translation particularly changes in the euro yen shekel and rupee relative to the us dollar affects our reported results starting in q1’20 our constant currency disclosures are calculated by multiplying the results in local currency for fy’20 and fy’19 by the exchange rates in effect on september 30 2019 excluding the effect of any hedging if fy20 reported results were converted into us dollars based on this methodology fy20 revenue would have been lower by 12 million and expenses would have been lower by 4 million the net impact on yearoveryear results would have been a decrease in operating income of 8 million in fy20 

the results of operations in the table above and revenue by line of business product group and geographic region in the tables that follow present both actual percentage changes year over year and percentage changes on a constant currency basis 

revenue

our revenue results period to period are impacted by contract terms including the duration and start dates of our subscription contracts early in q4’19 we discontinued offering cancellation rights for multiyear subscription contracts which results in the recognition of the license portion of revenue for all years of the contract at the beginning of the multiyear contract period for our onpremises subscription licenses the discontinuation of the cancellation clause is expected to have less of an impact in fy’21 we are expanding our saas offerings and are releasing additional cloud functionality into our products as a result our revenue will be impacted as a higher portion of it will be recognized ratably

 

revenue by line of business 

 



 

software revenue increased in fy’20 compared to fy’19 due to subscription revenue growth offset by declines in perpetual license and perpetual support revenue due to conversions of support contracts to subscriptions in fy’20 subscription license revenue increased 88 89 constant currency compared to the yearago period due in part to the discontinuation of the annual cancellation right in new multiyear contracts and in part to new conversions in fy’20 

professional services engagements typically result from sales of new licenses revenue is recognized over the term of the engagement our expectation is that professional services revenue will trend flattodown over time due to our strategy to expand margins by migrating more services engagements to our partners and delivering products that require less consulting and training services and in the nearterm will trend down due to the effects of the covid19 pandemic 

professional services revenue declined in fy’20 due to challenges with project scoping and implementation activities and performance due to social distancing measures and facility closures implemented to address the covid19 pandemic additionally there was an increase in the estimated costs to complete a large fixed price professional services contract which led to a corresponding decrease in the estimated percent complete and a related reversal of revenue

revenue by product group

 



 



core product software revenue growth in fy’20 compared to fy’19 was driven by subscription revenue growth of 68 69 constant currency offset by expected declines in perpetual license and perpetual support revenue due to the end of sales of perpetual licenses at the end of q1’19 and conversions of support contracts to subscriptions total revenue growth was lower than software revenue growth due to a decline in professional services revenue in fy’20 professional services revenue declined 26 actual and constant currency compared to the yearago period due in part to the impact of the covid19 pandemic and the impact of the professional services contract described above arr increased 14 11 constant currency for fy’20 compared to fy’19 reflecting solid arr growth for both plm and cad 

 

growth p roduct s oftware revenue growth in fy’20 was driven by subscription revenue growth of 49   50  constant currency compared to the yearago period  offset by an expected decline in perpetual license revenue due to the end of sales of perpetual licenses at the end of q1’19  the revenue growth rate has been impacted by a decrease in the proportion of license revenue recognized upfront as we have released additional cloud functionality for which revenue is recognized ratably into our iot products growth product arr increased 34  32 constant currency for fy’20 compared to fy’19 including growth from sales of our products through our strategic alliance with rockwell automation and reflecting strong growth in all three product lines  

fsg product software revenue declined in fy’20 compared to fy’19 primarily driven by a 13 actual and constant currency decrease in perpetual support revenue due to conversions of support contracts to subscriptions this decline was partially offset by a 12 13 constant currency increase in subscription revenue in fy’20 compared to the yearago period the total revenue decrease in fy’20 was higher than the decline in software revenue due to a decrease in professional services revenue which declined 21 20 constant currency in fy’20 compared to fy’19 due in part to the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our ability to execute professional services projects fsg product arr decreased 2 4 constant currency for fy’20 compared to fy’19 largely due to the impact of covid19 on fsg markets primarily due to the nonrenewal of a government contract which did not receive renewed funding 

software revenue by geographic region

a significant portion of our software revenue is generated outside the us in both fy19 and fy20 approximately 45 of software revenue was generated in the americas 35 in europe and 20 in asia pacific

 



 

americas software revenue growth in fy’20 was driven by growth in subscription revenue of 44 actual and constant currency as compared to fy’19  partially offset by a decline of 16 15 constant currency in perpetual support revenue resulting in recurring revenue growth of 24 25 constant currency 

europe software revenue growth in fy’20 was driven by growth in subscription revenue of 67 69 constant currency as compared to fy’19 partially offset by a decline in perpetual support revenue resulting in recurring revenue growth of 28 30 constant currency 

asia pacific software revenue growth in fy’20 was driven by growth in subscription revenue of 70 actual and constant currency as compared to fy’19 partially offset by declines of 86 actual and constant currency and 20 actual and constant currency in perpetual license and support revenue respectively recurring revenue growth was 26 actual and constant currency 

 

gross margin 

 



 



license gross margin increased in fy’20 compared to fy’19 due to revenue increasing significantly as a result of asc 606 and the discontinuation of the cancellation clause while cost of license expenses increased only slightly license revenue growth was driven by an 88 89 constant currency increase in subscription license revenue year over year partially offset by a 54 53 constant currency decrease in perpetual license revenue

support and cloud services gross margin decreased in fy’20 compared to fy’19 due to a decrease in perpetual support revenue and increases in costs associated with our cloud services business due to increased demand for those services royalty expenses and outside service costs this was partially offset by increases in subscription support and cloud services revenue

professional services gross margin decreased in fy’20 compared to fy’19 primarily due to a decrease in revenue driven by the impact of the covid19 pandemic and a revenue reversal on a fixed price professional services contract due to a change in the estimated cost to complete partially offset by decreases in outside services and travel costs 

operating expenses

 



 

total headcount increased by 3 in fy’20 to 6243 from 6055 at the end of fy’19 headcount at the end of fy’20 includes approximately 130 people from onshape and other smaller acquisitions 

operating expenses in fy20 compared to fy19 increased primarily due to the following



 







partially offset by





restructuring and other charges in fy’20 primarily related to an employee restructuring plan in the first half of the fiscal year to shift resources to support our saas initiatives restructuring and other charges in fy’19 largely related to the exit of our needham headquarters facility 

interest expense

 



 

interest expense includes interest under our credit facility and senior notes interest expense was higher in fy’20 as compared to fy’19 primarily due to increased debt to complete the onshape acquisition we had 1018 million of total debt at september 30 2020 compared to 673 million at september 30 2019 additionally we recognized 15 million of expense in fy’20 related to penalties for the early redemption of the 6000 senior notes due 2024 for additional detail on the changes in our debt structure see note 9 debt  included in the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report

the average interest rate on our total borrowings was 43 in fy20 and 54 in fy19 our average interest rate on the 10 billion in senior notes will be 38 in fy’21

other income expense

 



 

interest income represents earnings on the investment of our available cash and marketable securities

other expense net includes foreign currency gains and losses and other nonoperating gains and losses foreign currency gains and losses include costs of hedging contracts certain realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains or losses and foreign exchange gains or losses resulting from the required periodend currency remeasurement of the assets and liabilities of our subsidiaries that use the us dollar as their functional currency 

 

income taxes 

 



 

in fy’20 and fy’19 our tax rate differed from the us statutory federal income tax rate due to our corporate structure in which our foreign taxes are at a net effective tax rate lower than the us rate a significant amount of our foreign earnings is generated by our subsidiaries organized in ireland in fy’20 and fy’19 the foreign rate differential predominantly relates to these irish earnings  

in fy’20 in addition to the foreign rate differential our tax rate differed from the statutory federal income tax rate due to us tax reform the excess tax benefit related to stockbased compensation and the indirect effects of the adoption of asc 606 additionally we recorded benefits for the reduction of the us valuation allowance as a result of the onshape acquisition a further reduction to the valuation allowance was also recorded to reflect the impact from the scheduling of the reversal of existing temporary differences resulting in deferred tax liabilities that cannot be offset against deferred tax assets 

on march 27 2020 the us federal government enacted the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act the “cares act” the cares act is an emergency economic stimulus package in response to the covid19 pandemic which among other things contains numerous income tax provisions we have determined that the impact of the cares act was not material to our consolidated financial statements

in fy’19 our effective tax rate was higher than the statutory federal income tax rate due in large part to the scheduling of the reversal of existing temporary differences resulting in deferred tax liabilities that cannot be offset against deferred tax assets requiring an increase to the us valuation allowance us tax reform and foreign withholding taxes an obligation of the us parent this is offset by foreign rate differences the excess tax benefit related to stockbased compensation and the indirect effects of the adoption of asc 606 

in q4’16 we received an assessment of approximately 12 million from the tax authorities in south korea the assessment relates to various tax issues primarily foreign withholding taxes we have appealed and intend to vigorously defend our positions we believe that upon completion of a multilevel appeal process it is more likely than not that our positions will be sustained accordingly we have not recorded a tax reserve for this matter we paid this assessment in q1’17 and have recorded the amount in other assets pending resolution of the appeal process if the south korean tax authorities were to prevail then in addition to the 12 million already assessed the potential additional exposure through fy’20 would be approximately 17 million we are continuing to work with our advisors during the court process and still believe our position is sustainable

in april 2020 we became aware of a potential new interpretation of a withholding tax law in a nonus jurisdiction and its application to certain transactions that was not previously reasonably knowable by us we have evaluated this new interpretation and made an estimate of the potential tax liability a reserve for which was recorded in q3’20 and had an immaterial impact to our consolidated financial statements

operating measure

arr

arr annual run rate represents the annual value of our portfolio of active renewable customer contracts as of the end of the reporting period including subscription software cloud and support contracts arr includes iot and ar orders placed under our strategic alliance agreement with rockwell automation and includes orders placed to satisfy contractual quarterly minimum commitments

 

we believe arr is a valuable operating metric to measure the health of a subscription business because it captures expected subscription and support cash generation from new customers existing customer renewals and expansions and includes the impact of churn which reflects gross churn offset by the impact of any pricing increases 

because this measure represents the annual value of renewable customer contracts as of the end of a reporting period arr does not represent revenue for any particular period or remaining revenue that will be recognized in future periods

nongaap financial measures

the nongaap financial measures presented in the discussion of our results of operations and the respective most directly comparable gaap measures are















free cash flow is cash flow from operations net of capital expenditures which are expenditures for property and equipment and consist primarily of facility improvements including our construction expenses for our new seaport headquarters in fy’19 office equipment computer equipment and software we believe that free cash flow in conjunction with cash from operations is a useful measure of liquidity since capital expenditures are a necessary component of ongoing operations

the nongaap financial measures other than free cash flow exclude as applicable fair value adjustments related to acquired deferred revenue and deferred costs stockbased compensation expense amortization of acquired intangible assets acquisitionrelated and other transactional charges included in general and administrative expenses restructuring and other charges net nonoperating charges and income tax adjustments 

the items excluded from these nongaap financial measures are normally included in the comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with gaap our management excludes these items when evaluating our ongoing performance andor predicting our earnings trends and therefore excludes them when presenting nongaap financial measures management uses nongaap financial measures in conjunction with our gaap results as should investors

fair value adjustment of acquired deferred revenue is a purchase accounting adjustment recorded to reduce acquired deferred revenue to the fair value of the remaining obligation so our gaap revenue after an acquisition does not reflect the full amount of revenue that would have been reported if the acquired deferred revenue was not written down to fair value we believe excluding these adjustments to revenue from these contracts and associated costs in fair value adjustment of acquired deferred costs  is useful to investors as an additional means to assess revenue trends of our business 

stockbased compensation is a noncash expense relating to stockbased awards issued to executive officers employees and outside directors consisting of restricted stock units we exclude this expense as it is a noncash expense and we assess our internal operations excluding this expense and believe it facilitates comparisons to the performance of other companies in our industry 

 

amortization of acquired intangible assets is a noncash expense that is impacted by the timing and magnitude of our acquisitions we believe the assessment of our operations excluding these costs is relevant to our assessment of internal operations and comparisons to the performance of other companies in our industry 

acquisitionrelated and other transactional charges included in general and administrative expenses are direct costs of potential and completed acquisitions and expenses related to acquisition integration activities including transaction fees due diligence costs severance and professional fees subsequent adjustments to our initial estimated amount of contingent consideration associated with specific acquisitions are also included within acquisitionrelated charges other transactional charges include thirdparty costs related to structuring unusual transactions we do not include these costs when reviewing our operating results internally the occurrence and amount of these costs will vary depending on the timing and size of acquisitions 

restructuring and other charges net includes excess facility restructuring charges credits headquarters relocation charges impairment and accretion expense charges related to the lease assets of exited facilities sublease income from previously impaired facilities and severance costs resulting from reductions of personnel driven by modifications to our business strategy headquarters relocation charges are noncash accelerated depreciation expense recorded in advance of exiting our prior headquarters facility due to changes in the estimated useful lives of fixed assets and overlapping rental expense for the needham and seaport facilities we do not include these costs when reviewing our operating results internally these costs may vary in size based on our restructuring plan 

nonoperating charges in q2’20 we incurred an early redemption interest penalty and in q3’20 we wrote off debt issuance costs both of which were related to the settlement of the 6000 senior notes due 2024 and which are also excluded from our nongaap financial measures as they are nonordinary course in nature and not included in management’s review of our results 

income tax adjustments include the tax impact of the items above and assumes that we are profitable on a nongaap basis in the us and one foreign jurisdiction it also eliminates the effect of the valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets in those jurisdictions additionally we exclude other material tax items that we do not include when reviewing our operating results internally 

we use these nongaap financial measures and we believe that they assist our investors to make periodtoperiod comparisons of our operational performance because they provide a view of our operating results without items that are not in our view indicative of our core operating results we believe that these nongaap financial measures help illustrate underlying trends in our business and we use the measures to establish budgets and operational goals communicated internally and externally for managing our business and evaluating our performance we believe that providing nongaap financial measures also affords investors a view of our operating results that may be more easily compared to the results of other companies in our industry that use similar financial measures to supplement their gaap results

 

the items excluded from the nongaap financial measures often have a material impact on our financial results and such items often recur accordingly the nongaap financial measures included in this annual report should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for or superior to the comparable measures prepared in accordance with gaap the following tables reconcile each of these nongaap financial measures to its most closely comparable gaap measure on our financial statements

critical accounting policies and estimates

we have prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america in preparing our financial statements we make estimates assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our reported revenues results of operations and net income as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet these estimates assumptions and judgments are made based on our historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances these estimates may change as new events occur or additional information is obtained and we may periodically be faced with uncertainties the outcomes of which are not within our control and may not be known for a prolonged period of time

the accounting policies methods and estimates used to prepare our financial statements are described generally in note 2 summary of significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report the most important accounting judgments and estimates that we made in preparing the financial statements involved







a critical accounting policy is one that is both material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires us to make subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies require us to make assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time of the estimate and different estimates that we could have used or changes in the estimates that are reasonably likely to occur may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process actual results could differ from those estimates

accounting policies guidelines and interpretations related to our critical accounting policies and estimates are generally subject to numerous sources of authoritative guidance and are often reexamined by accounting standards rule makers and regulators these rule makers andor regulators may promulgate interpretations guidance or regulations that may result in changes to our accounting policies which could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations

 

revenue recognition 

effective october 1 2018 we record revenues in accordance with the guidance provided by asc 606 revenue from contracts with customers  for a full description of our revenue accounting policy please refer to note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  included in the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report

our sources of revenue include 1 subscription 2 perpetual license 3 support for perpetual licenses and 4 professional services subscriptions include termbased onpremises licenses softwareasaservice saas and hosting services revenue is derived from the licensing of computer software products and from related support andor professional services contracts 

judgments and estimates

determination of performance obligations our subscriptions are frequently sold as a bundle of products and services typically pairing onpremises term software licenses with support andor cloud services over the same term onpremises software is typically determined to be a distinct performance obligation and is thus recognized separately from the support andor cloud components onpremises software revenue is generally recognized at the point in time that the software is made available to the customer while the support and cloud revenue components are recognized over the term of the contract in cases where subscriptions include cloud functionality and onpremises software an assessment has been performed to determine whether the cloud services are distinct from the onpremises software in the substantial majority of instances cloud services provide incremental functionality to customers and have been considered distinct and recognized separately from the onpremises software this assessment could have a significant impact on the timing of revenue recognition and may change as our product offerings evolve 

allocation of transaction price we estimate the standalone selling price of each identified performance obligation and use that estimate to allocate the transaction price among said performance obligations the estimated standalone selling price is determined using all information reasonably available to us including market conditions and other observable inputs significant judgment is used in determining the standalone selling prices of the onpremises license support and cloud components of our subscription products these estimates are subject to change as our product offerings change and could have a significant impact due to the difference in the timing of revenue recognition for onpremises licenses and support andor cloud 

right to exchange our multiyear noncancellable onpremises subscription contracts provide customers with an annual right to exchange software within the original subscription with other software we account for this right as a refund liability for most contracts we use the expected value method to determine the refund liability associated with this right across a portfolio of contracts where contracts are outside of the standard portfolio of contracts due to contract size longer contract duration or other unique contractual terms we use the most likely amount method to determine the refund liability for each individual contract in both circumstances the transaction price is constrained based on our estimates which impacts the amount of revenue recognized changes in these estimates could significantly impact revenue for any given period 

accounting for income taxes

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to calculate our income tax expense based on taxable income by jurisdiction there are many transactions and calculations about which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain as a result our calculations involve estimates by management some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenuesharing costreimbursement and transfer pricing arrangements among related entities and the differing tax treatment of revenue and cost items across various jurisdictions if we were compelled to revise or to account differently for our arrangements that revision could affect our recorded tax liabilities

the income tax accounting process also involves estimating our actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our 

 

consolidated balance sheets we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized we must establish a valuation allowance as a charge to income tax expense 

as of september 30 2020 we have a valuation allowance of 1713 million against net deferred tax assets in the us and a valuation allowance of 341 million against net deferred tax assets in certain foreign jurisdictions we have concluded based on the weight of available evidence that a full valuation allowance continues to be required against our us net deferred tax assets as they are not more likely than not to be realized in the future we will continue to reassess our valuation allowance requirements each financial reporting period

the valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets of certain foreign jurisdictions is established primarily for our capital loss carryforwards the majority of which do not expire however there are limitations imposed on the utilization of such capital losses that could further restrict the recognition of any tax benefits

prior to the passage of the us tax act the company asserted that substantially all of the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries were considered indefinitely invested and accordingly no deferred taxes were provided pursuant to the provisions of the us tax act these earnings were subjected to a onetime transition tax and there is therefore no longer a material cumulative basis difference associated with the undistributed earnings we maintain our assertion to permanently reinvest these earnings outside the us unless repatriation can be done substantially taxfree with the exception of a foreign holding company formed in 2018 and our taiwan subsidiary if we decide to repatriate any additional nonus earnings in the future we may be required to establish a deferred tax liability on such earnings the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability on the undistributed earnings would not be material

in the normal course of business ptc and its subsidiaries are examined by various taxing authorities including the internal revenue service irs in the us we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate we are currently under audit by tax authorities in several jurisdictions audits by tax authorities typically involve examination of the deductibility of certain permanent items transfer pricing limitations on net operating losses and tax credits although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in material changes in our estimates

valuation of assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations

in accordance with business combination accounting we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values determining these fair values requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets

our identifiable intangible assets acquired consist of developed technology core technology tradenames customer lists and contracts and software support agreements and related relationships developed technology consists of products that have reached technological feasibility core technology represents a combination of processes inventions and trade secrets related to the design and development of acquired products customer lists and contracts and software support agreements and related relationships represent the underlying relationships and agreements with customers of the acquired company’s installed base we have generally valued intangible assets using a discounted cash flow model critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to





 

in addition we estimate the useful lives of our intangible assets based upon the expected period over which we anticipate generating economic benefits from the related intangible asset 

net tangible assets consist of the fair values of tangible assets less the fair values of assumed liabilities and obligations except for deferred revenues net tangible assets were generally valued by us at the respective carrying amounts recorded by the acquired company if we believed that their carrying values approximated their fair values at the acquisition date the values assigned to deferred revenue reflect an amount equivalent to the estimated cost plus an appropriate profit margin to perform the services related to the acquired company’s software support contracts

in addition uncertain tax positions and taxrelated valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date and we reevaluate these items quarterly with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill provided that we are within the measurement period up to one year from the acquisition date and we continue to collect information in order to determine their estimated values subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the estimated value of uncertain tax positions or taxrelated valuation allowances whichever comes first changes to these uncertain tax positions and taxrelated valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of operations

our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable at that time but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions estimates or actual results

when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a finitelived intangible asset may not be recoverable we perform an assessment of the asset for potential impairment this assessment is based on projected undiscounted future cash flows over the asset’s remaining life if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its undiscounted cash flows we record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset determined using projected discounted future cash flows of the asset

liquidity and capital resources

 



 

cash cash equivalents and restricted cash

we invest our cash with highly rated financial institutions and in diversified domestic and international money market mutual funds cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less in addition we hold investments in marketable securities totaling approximately 59 million with an average maturity of 12 months at september 30 2020 cash and cash equivalents totaled 275 million compared to 270 million at september 30 2019

a significant portion of our cash is generated and held outside the us as of september 30 2020 we had cash and cash equivalents of 39 million in the us 108 million in europe 99 million in asia pacific including india and 29 million in other nonus countries all our marketable securities are held in the us we have substantial cash requirements in the us but we believe that the combination of our existing us cash and cash equivalents marketable securities our ability to repatriate cash to the us more cost effectively with the recent us tax law changes future us operating cash flows and cash available under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our ongoing us operating expenses and known capital requirements

 

cash provided by operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities was 234 million in fy20 compared to 285 million in fy19 the yearoveryear decrease is primarily due to a 20 million increase in interest payments a 17 million increase in restructuring payments an 12 million decrease in tenant improvement reimbursements related to our seaport facility and an increase in tax payments offset by higher cash collections of accounts receivable

restructuring payments totaled 42 million in fy’20 compared to 25 million in fy’19 cash paid for income taxes was 53 million in fy’20 compared to 39 million in fy’19

cash used in investing activities

our net borrowings in fy’20 of 345 million were primarily used to fund the onshape acquisition these net borrowings reflect the issuance of 1 billion in new notes in february 2020 and the repayment of 500 million of earlier issued notes in may 2020 as well as net repayments of 155 million under our revolving credit facility in fy’19 net borrowings under the credit facility were 25 million used to fund working capital requirements and the frustum acquisition 

 

outstanding debt 

as of september 30 2020 we had

 



 

as of september 30 2020 we were in compliance with all financial and operating covenants of the credit facility and the note indentures any failure to comply with such covenants under the credit facility would prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under the credit facility and as with any failure to comply with such covenants under the note indentures could constitute a default that could cause all amounts outstanding to become due and payable immediately

our credit facility and our senior notes are described in note 9 debt to the condensed consolidated financial statements in this form 10k

share repurchase authorization

our articles of organization authorize us to issue up to 500 million shares of our common stock we used cash from operations and borrowings under our credit facility to make such repurchases in fy’19 all shares of our common stock repurchased are automatically restored to the status of authorized and unissued

on november 13 2020 the board of directors authorized us to repurchase 1 billion of our common stock through september 30 2023 we may use cash from operations and borrowings under our credit facility to make any such repurchases

expectations for fiscal 2021

we believe that existing cash and cash equivalents together with cash generated from operations and amounts available under the credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements which we expect to be approximately 25 million in fy’21 through at least the next twelve months and to meet our known longterm capital requirements 

our expected uses and sources of cash could change payments due to us may be delayed due to the covid19 pandemic our cash position could be reduced and we could incur additional debt obligations if we decide to retire debt engage in strategic transactions or repurchase shares any of which could be commenced suspended or completed at any time any such repurchases or retirement of debt will depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors the amounts involved in any debt retirement or issuance share repurchases or strategic transactions may be material

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

tableend

we face exposure to financial market risks including adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results

foreign currency exchange risk

our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to western european countries japan israel china and canada we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates that arise from receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies we do not enter into or hold foreign currency derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes nor do we enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge future cash flows or forecast transactions

our nonus revenues generally are transacted through our nonus subsidiaries and typically are denominated in their local currency in addition expenses that are incurred by our nonus subsidiaries typically are denominated in their local currency approximately 60 of our revenue and 40 of our expenses were transacted in currencies other than the us dollar currency translation affects our reported results because we report our results of operations in us dollars historically our most significant currency risk has been changes in the euro and japanese yen relative to the us dollar based on current revenue and expense levels excluding restructuring charges and stockbased compensation a 010 change in the usd to eur and a 10 yen change in the yen to usd exchange rate would impact operating income by approximately 19 million and 9 million respectively

our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations arises in part from intercompany transactions with most intercompany transactions occurring between a us dollar functional currency entity and a foreign currency denominated entity intercompany transactions typically are denominated in the local currency of the nonus dollar functional currency subsidiary in order to centralize foreign currency risk also both ptc the parent company and our nonus subsidiaries may transact business with our customers and vendors in a currency other than their functional currency transaction risk in addition we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results and balances of our nonus subsidiaries are translated into us dollars translation risk if sales to customers outside of the united states increase our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will increase

our foreign currency risk management strategy is principally designed to mitigate the future potential financial impact of changes in the us dollar value of balances denominated in foreign currency resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates our foreign currency hedging program uses forward contracts to manage the foreign currency exposures that exist as part of our ongoing business operations the contracts are primarily denominated in japanese yen and european currencies and have maturities of less than three months

generally we do not designate foreign currency forward contracts as hedges for accounting purposes and changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized immediately in earnings because we enter into forward contracts only as an economic hedge any gain or loss on the underlying foreigndenominated balance would be offset by the loss or gain on the forward contract gains and losses on forward contracts and foreign currency denominated receivables and payables are included in foreign currency net losses

 

as of september 30 2020 and 2019  we had outstanding forward contracts for derivatives not designated as hedging instruments with notional amounts equivalent to the following 

 



 

debt

in addition to the 1 billion due under our 2025 and 2028 senior notes as of september 30 2020 we had 18 million outstanding under our credit facility loans under the credit facility bear interest at variable rates which reset every 30 to 180 days depending on the rate and period selected by us these loans are subject to interest rate risk as interest rates will be adjusted at each rollover date to the extent such amounts are not repaid as of september 30 2020 the annual rate on the credit facility loans was 181 if there was a hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates the annual net impact to earnings and cash flows would be immaterial this hypothetical change in cash flows and earnings has been calculated based on the borrowings outstanding at september 30 2020 and a 100 basis point per annum change in interest rate applied over a oneyear period

cash and cash equivalents

as of september 30 2020 cash equivalents were invested in highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased we invest our cash with highly rated financial institutions in north america europe and asia pacific and in diversified domestic and international money market mutual funds at september 30 2020 we had cash and cash equivalents of 39 million in the united states 108 million in europe 99 million in asia pacific including india and 29 million in other nonus countries given the short maturities and investment grade quality of the portfolio holdings at september 30 2020 a hypothetical 10 change in interest rates would not materially affect the fair value of our cash and cash equivalents

our invested cash is subject to interest rate fluctuations and for nonus operations foreign currency risk in a declining interest rate environment we would experience a decrease in interest income the opposite holds true in a rising interest rate environment over the past several years the us federal reserve board european central bank and bank of england have changed certain benchmark interest rates which has led to declines and increases in market interest rates these changes in market interest rates have resulted in fluctuations in interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents interest income will continue to fluctuate based on changes in market interest rates and levels of cash available for investment changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar had an immaterial impact on our consolidated cash balances in 2020 and an unfavorable impact of 26 million and 78 million in 2019 and 2018 respectively in particular due to changes in the euro and the japanese yen

we derive most of our sales from products and services sold directly by our sales force to enduser customers approximately 20 to 30 of our sales of products and services are through thirdparty resellers and other strategic partners our sales force focuses on large accounts while our reseller channel provides a costeffective means of covering the small and mediumsize business market our strategic services partners provide service offerings to help customers implement our product offerings as we grow our iiot business we expect our gotomarket strategy will rely more on partners including the types of strategic partners described above and marketing directly to end users and developers

we compete with a number of companies that offer solutions that address one or more specific functional areas covered by our solutions in our iiot business we compete with large established companies like amazon ibm oracle sap siemens ag and ge there are also a number of small companies that compete in the market for iot products we believe our thingworx iot platform and solutions are complementary to the offerings of many of our competitors and we have partnered with many of the named competitors for enterprise cad and plm solutions and for discrete desktop cad products we compete with companies including autodesk dassault systèmes sa and siemens ag for plm solutions we also compete with oracle and sap but we believe our products are more specifically targeted toward the business process challenges of manufacturing companies and offer broader and deeper functionality for those processes than erpbased solutions

 item 1a   risk factors 

the following are important factors we have identified that could affect our future results and your investment in our securities you should consider them carefully when evaluating an investment in ptc securities or any forwardlooking statements made by us including those contained in this annual report because these factors could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or the performance projected in forward looking statements the risks described below are not the only risks we face additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business financial condition andor operating results holders of the 600 senior notes due 2024 the “2024 6 notes” that we issued in may 2016 should also consider the risk factors related to those notes described in the prospectus supplement we filed with the securities and exchange commission on may 5 2016 which are incorporated herein by reference 

i risks related to our business operations and industry 

we face significant competition which may reduce our profitability and limit or reduce our market share 

the markets for our products and solutions are rapidly changing and characterized by intense competition disruptive technology developments evolving distribution models and increasingly lower barriers to entry if we are unable to provide products and solutions that address customers’ needs as well as our competitors’ products and solutions do or to align our pricing licensing and delivery models with customer preferences we could lose customers andor fail to attract new customers which could cause us to lose revenue and market share competitive pressures could also cause us to reduce our prices which could reduce our revenue and margins 

our current and potential competitors range from large and wellestablished companies to emerging startups some of our competitors and potential competitors have greater name recognition in the markets we serve and greater financial technical sales and marketing and other resources which could limit our ability to gain customer recognition and confidence in our products and solutions and successfully sell our products and solutions which could adversely affect our ability to grow our business 

a breach of security in our products or computer systems or those of our thirdparty service providers could compromise the integrity of our products cause loss of data harm our reputation create additional liability and adversely impact our financial results 

we have implemented and continue to implement measures intended to maintain the security and integrity of our products source code and computer systems the potential consequences of a security breach or system disruption particularly through cyberattack or cyberintrusion including by computer hackers foreign governments and cyber terrorists have increased in scope as the number intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased despite efforts to create security barriers to such threats it is impossible for us to eliminate this risk and in fact we deal with security issues on a regular basis and have experienced security incidents from time to time accordingly there is a risk that we might encounter a material event or issue and that such an event or issue may occur 

in addition we offer cloud services to our customers and some of our products are hosted by thirdparty service providers which expose us to additional risks as those repositories of our customers’ proprietary data may be targeted by hackers 

a significant breach of the security and or integrity of our products or systems or those of our thirdparty service providers could prevent our products from functioning properly could enable access to sensitive proprietary or confidential information including that of our customers or could disrupt our business operations or those of our customers this could require us to incur significant costs of investigation remediation and further protection harm our reputation cause customers to stop buying our products and cause us to face lawsuits and potential liability which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

we may be unable to hire or retain personnel with the necessary skills to operate and grow our business which could adversely affect our ability to compete 

our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial sales and marketing technical financial and administrative personnel to operate and grow our business competition for such personnel in our industry is intense particularly in the boston massachusetts area where our global headquarters is located 

the technical personnel required to develop our products and solutions are in high demand particularly technical personnel with augmented and virtual reality and analytics expertise as there are comparatively fewer persons with those skills if we are unable to attract and retain technical personnel with the requisite skills our product and solution development efforts could be delayed which could adversely affect our ability to compete and thereby adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

the managerial sales and marketing financial and administrative personnel necessary to guide our operations market and sell our solutions and support our business operations are also in high demand due to the intense competition in our industry 

if we are unable to attract and retain the personnel we need to develop compelling products and solutions and guide operate and support our business we may be unable to successfully compete in the marketplace which would adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

we depend on sales within the discrete manufacturing sector and our business could be adversely affected if manufacturing activity does not grow or if it contracts or if manufacturers are adversely affected by other economic factors 

a large amount of our sales are to customers in the discrete manufacturing sector the global manufacturing purchasing managers index pmi has declined significantly over the past year and remained below the 50 level in september 2019 with a particularly large recent decline in europe although the decline in manufacturing pmi did not have a significant adverse affect on our business in 2019 if the manufacturing sector does not improve or continues to decline our customers in this sector may as they have in the past reduce or defer purchases of our products and services which could adversely affect our financial results 

in addition manufacturers worldwide are facing increasing uncertainty about the global economic climate due to among other factors the geopolitical environment and ongoing trade tensions and tariffs in addition within the technology industry the us administration’s focus on technology transactions with nonus entities and potential expanded prohibitions has created additional uncertainty in light of these concerns and challenges including the potential enactment or expansion of laws that restrict our ability to sell our solutions to customers customers may delay reduce or forego purchases of our solutions which would adversely affect our business and financial results 

if we fail to successfully manage our transition to a subscriptionbased licensing company our business and financial results could be adversely affected 

we completed our transition from offering perpetual licenses for our products to offering only subscriptionbased licenses worldwide in january 2019 excluding kepware while we expect our subscription base recurring revenue and cash flow to increase over time as a result of this licensing model transition our ability to achieve these financial objectives is subject to risks and uncertainties becoming a subscriptionbased licensing company requires a considerable investment of technical financial legal and sales resources and a scalable organization whether our transition will be successful and will accomplish our business and financial objectives is subject to uncertainties including but not limited to customer demand attach and renewal rates channel acceptance our ability to further develop and scale infrastructure our ability to include functionality and usability in such offerings that address customer requirements and our costs if we are unable to successfully establish these new offerings and navigate our business transition due to the foregoing risks and uncertainties our business and financial results could be adversely impacted 

because our sales and operations are globally dispersed we face additional compliance risks and any compliance risk could adversely affect our business and financial results 

we sell and deliver software and services and maintain support operations in a large number of countries whose laws and practices differ from one another and are subject to unexpected changes managing these geographically dispersed operations requires significant attention and resources to 

ensure compliance with laws of those countries and those of the us governing our activities in nonus countries 

those laws include but are not limited to anticorruption laws and regulations including the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and the uk bribery act 2010 data privacy laws and regulations including the european unions general data privacy regulation and trade and economic sanctions laws and regulations including laws administered by the us department of the treasury’s office of foreign assets control the us state department the us department of commerce the united nations security council and other relevant sanctions authorities our compliance risks are heightened due to the gotomarket approach for our businesses that relies heavily on a partner ecosystem the fact that we operate in and are expanding into countries with a higher incidence of corruption and fraudulent business practices than others the fact that we deal with governments and stateowned business enterprises the fact that cyber attacks and intrusions that could expose sensitive information have increased and the fact that global enforcement of laws has significantly increased 

accordingly while we strive to maintain a comprehensive compliance program we cannot guarantee that an employee agent or business partner will not act in violation of our policies or us or other applicable laws that a cyber attack or intrusion would not be successful or that we may inadvertently violate such laws investigations of alleged violations of those laws and cyber intrusions can be expensive and disruptive violations of such laws can lead to civil andor criminal prosecutions substantial fines and other sanctions including the revocation of our rights to continue certain operations and also cause business and reputation loss which could adversely affect our financial results andor stock price 

our international businesses present economic and operating risks which could adversely affect our business and financial results 

we expect that our international operations will continue to expand and to account for a significant portion of our total revenue because we transact business in various foreign currencies the volatility of foreign exchange rates has had and may in the future have a material adverse effect on our revenue expenses and operating results 

other risks inherent in our international operations include but are not limited to the following 

 we may have exposure to additional tax liabilities and our effective tax rate may increase or fluctuate which could increase our income tax expense and reduce our net income 

as a multinational organization we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes in the us and in various foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision and other tax liabilities in the ordinary course of a global business there are many intercompany transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain our tax returns are subject to review by various taxing authorities although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes could be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals for example we have an open tax dispute in south korea with respect to which we paid 12 million in 2017 to accommodate the potential tax liability through 2015 which we are disputing if we do not prevail in that challenge we could be subject to additional liabilities for periods after 2015 which we estimate could be 13 million 

our effective tax rate can be adversely affected by several factors many of which are outside of our control including 



 ii risks related to acquisitions and strategic relationships 

businesses we acquire may not generate the revenue and earnings we anticipate and may otherwise adversely affect our business 

we have acquired and intend to continue to acquire new businesses and technologies if we fail to successfully integrate and manage the businesses and technologies we acquire or if an acquisition does not further our business strategy as we expect our operating results will be adversely affected 

moreover business combinations involve risks and uncertainties that can adversely affect our operations and operating results including 

 our inability to maintain or develop our strategic and technology relationships could adversely affect our business 

we have many strategic and technology relationships with other companies with which we work to offer complementary solutions and services that market and sell our solutions and that provide technologies that we embed in our solutions we may not realize the expected benefits from these relationships and such relationships may be terminated by the other party if these companies fail to perform or if a company terminates or substantially alters the terms of the relationship we could suffer delays in product development reduced sales or other operational difficulties and our business results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

iii risks related to our intellectual property 

we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights which could adversely affect our business and our ability to compete effectively 

our software products are proprietary we protect our intellectual property rights in these items by relying on copyrights trademarks patents and common law safeguards including trade secret protection as well as restrictions on disclosures and transferability contained in our agreements with other parties despite these measures the laws of all relevant jurisdictions may not afford adequate protection to our products and other intellectual property in addition we frequently encounter attempts by individuals and companies to pirate our software if our measures to protect our intellectual property rights fail others may be able to use those rights which could reduce our competitiveness and revenues 

in addition any legal action to protect our intellectual property rights that we may bring or be engaged in could be costly may distract management from daytoday operations and may lead to additional claims against us and we may not succeed all of which would materially adversely affect our operating results 

intellectual property infringement claims could be asserted against us which could be expensive to defend and could result in limitations on our use of the claimed intellectual property 

the software industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding copyright patent and other intellectual property rights if a lawsuit of this type is filed it could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel we cannot be sure that we would prevail against any such asserted claims if we did not prevail we could be prevented from using the claimed intellectual property or be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements which might not be available on terms acceptable to us in addition to possible claims with respect to our proprietary products some of our products contain technology developed by and licensed from third parties and we may likewise be susceptible to infringement claims with respect to these thirdparty technologies 

iv risks related to our indebtedness 

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations as well as our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt 

we have a significant amount of indebtedness as of november 15 2019 our total debt outstanding was approximately 11 billion approximately 628 million of which was under our 1 billion secured credit facility which matures in september 2023 and 500 million of which was associated with the 6 senior notes issued may 2016 which mature in may 2024 and are unsecured of the 628 million outstanding under our secured credit facility 455 million was borrowed on november 1 2019 to finance our acquisition of onshape in november 2019 we also amended the credit facility to increase the revolving loan commitment from 700 million to 1 billion see liquidity and capital resourcesoutstanding notes in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this annual report all amounts outstanding under the credit facility and the notes will be due and payable in full on their respective maturity dates as of november 15 2019 we had unused commitments under our credit facility of approximately 357 million ptc inc and one of our foreign subsidiaries are eligible borrowers under the credit facility and certain other foreign subsidiaries may become borrowers under our credit facility in the future subject to certain conditions 

notwithstanding the limits contained in the credit agreement governing our credit facility and the indenture governing our 2024 6 notes we may be able to incur substantial additional debt from time to time to finance working capital capital expenditures investments or acquisitions or for other purposes if we do so the risks related to our level of debt could intensify specifically our level of debt could 

 any of the abovelisted factors could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt agreements 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness which may not be successful 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business legislative regulatory and other factors some 

of which are beyond our control we may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness 

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness we may not be able to effect any such alternative measures if necessary on commercially reasonable terms or at all and even if successful those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations our debt agreements restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due 

our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all would materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations and our ability to satisfy our debt obligations 

if we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt we will be in default and the lenders under our credit facility could terminate their commitments to loan money the lenders could foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings the holders of our 2024 6 notes could declare all outstanding principal premium if any and interest to be due and payable and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation all of these events could result in a loss of your investment 

we are required to comply with certain financial and operating covenants under our debt agreements any failure to comply with those covenants could cause amounts borrowed to become immediately due and payable andor prevent us from borrowing under the credit facility 

we are required to comply with specified financial and operating covenants under our debt agreements and to make payments under our debt which limit our ability to operate our business as we otherwise might operate it our failure to comply with any of these covenants or to meet any debt payment obligations could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived would result in any amounts outstanding including any accrued interest andor unpaid fees becoming immediately due and payable we might not have sufficient working capital or liquidity to satisfy any repayment obligations in the event of an acceleration of those obligations in addition if we are not in compliance with the financial and operating covenants under the credit facility when we wish to borrow funds we will be unable to borrow funds 

in addition the financial and operating covenants under the credit facility may limit our ability to borrow funds including for strategic acquisitions and share repurchases 

our credit facility has variable interest tied to libor and we could become subject to higher interest rates if the replacement rate we agree on with our banks is higher 

borrowings under our revolving credit facility use the london interbank offering rate libor as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate libor is the subject of recent national international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform these reforms and other pressures may cause libor to disappear entirely or to perform differently than in the past although we believe the recent discussions about alternative rates will not materially increase the interest rates on our credit facility the final agreed rate may increase the cost of our variable rate indebtedness 

v risks related to our common stock and debt securities 

our operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter making future operating results difficult to predict failure to meet market expectations could cause the price of our securities to decline 

our quarterly operating results historically have fluctuated and are likely to continue to fluctuate depending on many factors including 



 accordingly our quarterly results are difficult to predict prior to the end of the quarter and we may be unable to confirm or adjust expectations with respect to our operating results for a quarter until that quarter has closed any failure to meet our quarterly revenue or earnings targets could adversely impact the market price of our securities 

our longrange financial targets are predicated on expanding our portfolio of recurring revenue contracts arr growth operating margin improvements and cash flow growth that we may fail to achieve which could reduce our expected earnings and cause us to fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors and cause the price of our securities to decline 

we are projecting longterm arr operating margin and cash flow growth our projections are based on the expected growth potential in the iot and ar markets as well as more modest growth in our core cad and plm markets we may not achieve the expected arr growth if the markets we serve do not grow at expected rates if customers do not purchase renew or expand subscriptions as we expect if we are not able to deliver solutions desired by customers and potential customers andor if acquired businesses do not generate the revenue growth that we expect 

over time we expect our operating margin to improve which improvements are predicated on operating leverage and on improved operating efficiencies particularly within our sales organization and on service margin improvements if we are unable to reduce our sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue through productivity initiatives or to reduce the amount of services we provide andor to improve our services margins we may not achieve our operating margin targets 

if we fail to achieve our longrange financial targets or if analysts and investors expect that we will not achieve our longrange financial targets the price of our securities could decline 

our stock price has been volatile which may make it harder to resell shares at a favorable time and price 

market prices for securities of software companies are generally volatile and are subject to significant fluctuations that may be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies the trading prices and valuations of these stocks and of ours may not be predictable negative changes in the public’s perception of the prospects of software companies or of ptc or the markets we serve could depress our stock price regardless of our operating results 

also a large percentage of our common stock is held by institutional investors and by rockwell automation purchases and sales of our common stock by these investors could have a significant impact on the market price of the stock for more information about those investors please see our proxy statement with respect to our most recent annual meeting of stockholders and schedules 13d and 13g filed with the sec with respect to our common stock 

our 2024 6 notes are not listed on any national securities exchange or included in any automated quotation system which could make it harder to resell the notes at a favorable time and price 

our 2024 6 notes are not listed on any national securities exchange or included in any automated quotation system as a result an active market for the notes may not exist or be maintained which would adversely affect the market price and liquidity of the notes in that case holders may not be able to sell their notes when they want to or at a favorable price 

the market for noninvestment grade debt historically has been subject to severe disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the notes the market if any for 

the notes may experience similar disruptions and any such disruptions may adversely affect the liquidity in that market or the prices at which the notes may be sold

operating and nongaap financial measures 

our discussion of results includes discussion of our operating measures including arr “license and subscription bookings” and other subscriptionrelated measures and nongaap financial measures our operating measures and nongaap financial measures including the reasons we use those measures are described below in results of operations  operating measures and results of operations  nongaap financial measures respectively you should read those sections to understand our operating and nongaap financial measures 

revenue sources and recognition 

we sell software subscription and perpetual licenses support for perpetual licenses cloud services and professional services 

subscription revenue is comprised of timebased licenses whereby customers use our software and receive related support for a specified term results for reporting periods beginning on or after october 1 2018 are presented under the accounting standards update no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 asc 606 while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with the guidance provided by asc 985605 softwarerevenue recognition and revenues for nonsoftware deliverables in accordance with asc 60525 revenue recognition multipleelement arrangements asc 605 through 2018 revenue for our subscription contracts was recognized ratably over the term of the contract under asc 605 this differs from how revenue for such contracts is recognized under asc 606 our contracts with customers may include multiple goods and services under asc 606 revenue is recognized for each performance obligation that can be separately identified under the contract accordingly our onpremise subscription contracts are unbundled into multiple performance obligations ie license cloud and support determining whether the software licenses and the cloud services are distinct from each other and therefore performance obligations to be accounted for separately or not distinct from each other and therefore part of a single performance obligation may require significant judgment to date for the majority of our products we have concluded that the onpremise software licenses and cloud services provided in our subscription offerings are distinct from each other such that revenue from each performance obligation within the offering should be recognized separately we will continue to review this conclusion as the cloud services that we deliver in combination with our onpremise subscriptions continue to evolve which could result in changes to how we recognize revenue for such products the license portion of our onpremise subscription contracts approximately 50 to 55 is recognized upfront and the cloud and support portions approximately 45 to 50 are recognized ratably over the term software as a service saas and cloud services for which revenue is generally recognized ratably over the term of the contract are included in subscription revenue and have been immaterial to date 

perpetual licenses are a perpetual right to use the software for which revenue is generally recognized up front upon shipment to the customer support revenue is comprised of contracts to maintain new andor previously purchased licenses for which revenue is recognized ratably over the 

term of the contract professional services engagements typically result from sales of new licenses and for which revenue is recognized as the services are performed 

our revenue recognition practices and the effects of our adoption of asc 606 including adjustments to accumulated deficit related to billed and unbilled deferred revenue are described in revenue recognition and recently adopted accounting pronouncements in note 2 summary of significant accounting policies and in note 3 revenue from contracts with customers in the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report 

our adoption of asc 606 has increased the volatility of our revenue results as a significant portion of subscription revenue is recognized at the time of delivery rather than being recognized ratably over the contract period 

executive overview 

arr increased 10 to 1116 million 1134 million and 12 at the guidance rate as of the end of 2019 reflecting solid growth for this metric across all our businesses particularly in our iot and ar businesses 

operating cash flow was 285 million up 15 in 2019 compared to 2018 we made 22 million more in restructuring payments in 2019 compared to 2018 related to our workforce realignment and headquarters relocation 

our 2019 results reflect continued demand for our plm and cad products as well as growing demand for our iot and augmented reality ar products license and subscription bookings in the fourth quarter of 2019 were 150 million higher than anticipated driven by strong bookings in iot and ar including a mega deal bookings greater than 5 million with our strategic alliance partner rockwell automation license and subscription bookings were 472 million up 1 4 constant currency in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily driven by strong iot and ar bookings growth offset by declines in plm and cad bookings 

under asc 605 total revenue software revenue and subscription revenue grew in 2019 compared to 2018 despite an 800 basis point increase in subscription mix in 2019 under asc 605 recurring software revenue was 1079 million an increase of 10 13 constant currency in 2019 compared to 2018 under asc 605 recurring revenue as a percentage of software revenue was 94 in 2019 compared to 90 in 2018 under asc 605 perpetual license and support revenue decreased year over year because we discontinued offering perpetual licenses for most of our solutions effective january 1 2019 operating margin under asc 605 increased 200 basis points in 2019 resulting from the compounding effect of subscription licenses and lower operating expenses due to effective cost discipline eps declined under asc 605 in 2019 primarily due to a higher tax provision 

summary revenue and earnings results 

  



2 under asc 605 we have classified all subscription revenue as subscription license revenue 



1 nongaap financial measures are reconciled to gaap results under results of operations  nongaap measures below 

we ended 2019 with cash cash equivalents and marketable securities of 327 million up from 316 million at the end of 2018 we generated 285 million of cash from operations in 2019 compared to 248 million in 2018 cash from operations in 2019 includes 25 million of restructuring payments compared to 3 million in the yearago period in 2019 we also used cash from operations to repurchase 115 million of common stock as of september 30 2019 the balance outstanding under our credit facility was 173 million and total debt outstanding was 673 million 

operating measures 

we provide these measures to help investors understand the progress of our subscription transition these measures are not necessarily indicative of revenue for the period or any future period 

arr 

arr at the end of 2019 grew 10 12 constant currency compared to the end of 2018 reflecting the strength of our products and solutions and the value we provide to our customers our cad and plm businesses saw combined arr growth of 8 10 constant currency our iot and ar businesses delivered 26 arr growth 28 constant currency with the combination of iot and ar exiting fiscal 2019 at greater than 12 of total arr and onethird of total bookings these businesses represent a growing portion of the ptc business our focused solutions group closed the year stronger than expected delivering 8 10 constant currency arr growth for the year 

license and subscription bookings 

license and subscription bookings for 2019 were 472 million up 1 over 2018 4 on a constant currency basis in the fourth quarter of 2019 we had a mega deal bookings greater than 5 million with rockwell automation the mega deal from rockwell automation was issued to satisfy a portion of 

expected 2020 demand and will be credited against committed acv minimums due in 2020 under the parties’ strategic alliance agreement as amended 

subscription acv 

new s ubscription acv increased 13 over 2018 to 199 million due to continued adoption of our subscription offerings around the globe 

deferred revenue and backlog unbilled deferred revenue 

deferred revenue primarily relates to software agreements invoiced to customers for which the revenue has not yet been recognized unbilled deferred revenue backlog is the aggregate of booked orders for license support and subscription including multiyear subscription contracts with start dates after october 1 2018 through the third quarter of 2019 that were subject to a limited annual cancellation right of which approximately 158 million was cancellable at september 30 2019 for which the associated revenue has not been recognized and the customer has not yet been invoiced early in the fourth quarter of 2019 we discontinued the cancellation right for substantially all new contracts we do not record unbilled deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheets such amounts are recorded as deferred revenue when we invoice the customer we provide this view of deferred revenue and backlog to enable investors to understand the significant contractual commitments we have to customers and to provide a view of future revenue that we expect will be recognized even if those commitments are not reflected on our balance sheet 



1 upon adoption of asc 606 approximately 367 million of total deferred revenue was recorded as a decrease to accumulated deficit with an offsetting 219 million increase to unbilled accounts receivable a 143 million decrease to deferred revenue and a 5 million increase in other assets net of liabilities primarily as a result of the acceleration of subscription license revenue under asc 606 

of the unbilled deferred revenue balance at september 30 2019 we expect to invoice customers approximately 504 million within the next twelve months unbilled deferred revenue decreased by 3 year over year due to initial multiyear contracts renewing for shorter periods 

we expect that the amount of deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue will fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to the specific timing duration and size of customer subscription and support agreements varying billing cycles of such agreements the specific timing of customer renewals which are typically for one year foreign currency fluctuations the timing of when deferred revenue is recognized as revenue and the timing of our fiscal quarter ends the average contract duration was approximately 2 years for new subscription contracts in 2019 2018 and 2017 

the effects of our adoption of asc 606 including the adjustments to accumulated deficit related to billed and unbilled deferred revenue are described in note 3 revenue from contracts with customers in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

subsequent events 

on november 1 2019 ptc acquired onshape creators of the first software as a service saas product development platform that unites robust cad with powerful data management and collaboration tools for approximately 470 million net of cash acquired the acquisition is expected to accelerate ptcs ability to attract new customers with a saasbased product offering and position the company to capitalize on the inevitable industry transition to saas in connection with the acquisition ptc borrowed 455 million under its existing credit facility 

on november 13 2019 we increased the revolving loan commitment under the credit facility to 1 billion and made other administrative amendments to the credit facility 

future expectations strategies and risks 

our transition to a subscription model has been a headwind for revenue and earnings in 2019 with an increase in our subscription bookings mix of 800 basis points as compared to 2018 we expect the effect of the transition to moderate in fiscal 2020 we expect to grow revenue and expand our margins in fiscal 2020 we anticipate that iot and ar adoption rates will continue to expand and will be the most significant driver to growth in addition we believe the recent acquisition of onshape will provide us an opportunity to participate in the higher growth cad and plm markets serving small and medium businesses where we traditionally have not had a presence 

ptc remains committed to longterm development of creo and windchill we want to be bestinclass with both the onpremise and saas deployment models in the cad market we will continue our pursuits of realtime simulation generative design additive manufacturing and embedded iot and ar capabilities 

with the growth opportunity in the saasbased cad market and other strategic initiatives we have undertaken as well as our continued commitment to operating margin improvement we are realigning our workforce in 2020 to shift investment to support these strategic high growth opportunities we expect this realignment will result in a restructuring charge of up to 25 million in 2020 the effect of the realignment is reflected in our 2020 guidance 

as we move into 2020 our three overriding goals are 



results of operations 

the following table shows the financial measures that we consider the most significant indicators of the performance of our business in addition to providing measures calculated under generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” we also provide nongaap financial measures for the reported periods investors should use these nongaap financial measures only in conjunction with our gaap results 

for discussion of 2018 results and comparison with 2017 results refer to managements discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations in our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended september 30 2018  



  

1 see nongaap financial measures below for a reconciliation of our gaap results to our nongaap measures 

2 we have a full valuation allowance against our us net deferred tax assets and a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets in certain foreign jurisdictions as we are profitable on a nongaap basis the 2019  2017 nongaap tax provisions are calculated assuming there is no valuation allowance income tax adjustments reflect the tax effects of nongaap adjustments which are calculated by applying the applicable tax rate by jurisdiction to the nongaap adjustments listed above we recorded the impact of the tax cuts and jobs act in our 2018 gaap earnings resulting in a noncash benefit of approximately 12 million we have excluded this benefit from our nongaap results 

3 cash flow from operations for 2019 includes 25 million of restructuring payments cash flow from operations for 2018 includes 3 million of restructuring payments cash flow from operations for 2017 includes 37 million of restructuring payments a 12 million payment related to a korea tax audit and 3 million of legal settlement payments 

impact of foreign currency exchange on results of operations 

approximately 60 of our revenue and 40 of our expenses are transacted in currencies other than the us dollar currency translation affects our reported results which are in us dollars if 2019 reported results were converted into us dollars based on the corresponding prior year’s foreign currency exchange rates 2019 revenue would have been higher by 34 million and expenses would have been higher by 22 million the net impact on yearoveryear results would have been an increase in operating income of 12 million in 2019 the results of operations revenue by line of business and revenue by geographic region in the tables that follow present both actual percentage changes year over year and percentage changes on a constant currency basis 

revenue 

we discuss our revenue results by line of business by product group and by geographic region below our discussion is focused on our results under asc 605 for purposes of comparability in 2019 our asc 606 software revenue results were lower than under asc 605 primarily as a result of the acceleration of our onpremise subscription revenue associated with the retained earnings adoption adjustment recorded in the first quarter offset by revenue recognized in 2019 which would otherwise have been recognized ratably over future years under asc 605 professional services revenue under asc 606 was higher than under asc 605 due to the requirement to separately identify certain performance obligations which would have otherwise been combined and recognized ratably under asc 605 but instead were recognized in 2019 

revenue by line of business 

software 

software revenue consists of subscription support and perpetual license revenue under asc 605 recurring software revenue consists of subscription and support revenue and was 82 of total revenue and 94 of software revenue for 2019 our subscription revenue includes an immaterial amount of software as a service saas and cloud services revenue 

as our mix of subscription sales relative to perpetual license sales has increased perpetual license revenue and support revenue have declined and are expected to continue to decline as customers purchase our solutions as subscriptions and convert existing perpetual licenses with support contracts to 

subscriptions effective january 1 2019 new software licenses for our core solutions and thingworx solutions became available only by subscription worldwide 

our results have been impacted and we expect will continue to be impacted by our ability to close large transactions the amount of bookings and revenue particularly license and subscriptions attributable to large transactions and the number of such transactions may vary significantly from quarter to quarter based on customer purchasing decisions and macroeconomic conditions such transactions may have long lead times as they often follow a lengthy product selection and evaluation process and for existing customers are influenced by contract expiration cycles this may cause volatility in our results 

professional services 

professional services engagements typically result from sales of new licenses revenue is recognized over the term of the engagement under asc 605 professional services revenue was up 5 9 constant currency in 2019 compared to 2018 professional services revenue in 2018 includes a 145 million writedown related to a settlement of a customer dispute concerning a receivable excluding the impact of this writedown professional services revenue in 2019 would have declined 4 year over year we expect that professional services revenue will trend flattodown over time due to our strategy to expand margins by migrating services engagements to our partners and delivering products that require less consulting and training services 

revenue by product group 



solutions group 

under asc 605 solutions group software revenue grew in 2019 compared to 2018 driven by growth in subscription revenue which was up 41 44 on a constant currency basis year over year this growth was offset in part by the 49 46 on a constant currency basis decline in perpetual license revenue in 2019 due to the end of life of perpetual licenses 

solutions professional services revenue in 2018 reflects the 145 million writedown described above excluding the impact of this writedown solutions professional services revenue would have declined 11 year over year solutions professional services revenue for 2019 declined compared to 2018 due to our strategy to limit the amount of professional services we provide 

iot group 

under asc 605 iot recurring software revenue grew by 25 27 on a constant currency basis in 2019 reflecting the strong bookings growth over the past several years and the compounding benefit of our maturing subscription model iot software revenue in 2018 reflects 52 million of new subscription revenue related to the customer dispute settlement described above which settlement included the purchase of new subscription licenses 

iot professional services revenue increased in 2019 due to implementation and adoption services we sell in connection with new software licenses as part of our efforts to help customers iot initiatives succeed 

revenue by geographic region 



americas 

the growth in asc 605 software revenue in 2019 was due to growth of subscription revenue which was up 37 over 2018 this growth was offset in part by a decline of 9 8 on a constant currency basis in perpetual license revenue in 2019 due to the end of life of perpetual licenses in the americas as of january 1 2018 

professional services revenue in 2018 reflects the 145 million writedown related to the customer dispute settlement described above excluding the impact of this writedown professional services revenue in the americas would have declined 8 year over year 

europe 

under asc 605 software revenue in 2019 grew over 2018 driven by the growth in subscription revenue which was up 37 44 on a constant currency basis year over year this growth was offset in part by the decline of 51 47 on a constant currency basis in perpetual license revenue in 2019 due to the end of life of perpetual licenses in europe as of january 1 2018 

yearoveryear declines in foreign currency exchange rates particularly the euro impacted european revenue unfavorably in 2019 by 26 million 

asia pacific 

under asc 605 software revenue in 2019 grew slightly over 2018 driven by growth in subscription revenue of 49 51 on a constant currency basis year over year this growth was offset in part by the decline of 38 36 on a constant currency basis in perpetual license revenue in 2019 due to the end of life of perpetual licenses in asia pacific as of january 1 2019 

yearoveryear changes in foreign currency exchange rates unfavorably impacted asia pacific revenue by 6 million in 2019 

gross margin 



under asc 605 the increase in total gross margin in 2019 compared to 2018 reflects higher software revenue driven by the increase in recurring subscription revenue margins for license and subscription are beginning to expand as the subscription model matures and revenue that has been deferred begins to contribute to each quarterly period under asc 605 support gross margins are down in 2019 compared 2018 due to the decrease in perpetual support revenue due to conversions of support to subscription and the end of life of perpetual licenses 

professional services revenue in 2018 reflects the 145 million revenue writedown associated with the customer dispute described above without the revenue writedown professional services gross margin would have been 17 in 2018

2019 compared to 2018 

asc 605 costs and expenses in 2019 compared to 2018 increased primarily due to the following 

 the increases above were partially offset by 

 costs and expenses for 2019 compared to 2018 include a 222 million decrease due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

cost of license revenue 



our cost of license revenue consists of fixed and variable costs associated with reproducing and distributing software and documentation as well as royalties paid to third parties for technology embedded in or licensed with our software products amortization of intangible assets associated with acquired products and cost of subscription licensing costs associated with providing postcontract support such as providing software updates and technical support for both our subscription offerings and our perpetual licenses are included in cost of support and cloud service revenue cost of license revenue as a percentage of license revenue can vary depending on the subscription mix percentage the product mix sold the effect of fixed and variable royalties headcount and the level of amortization of acquired software intangible assets 

cost of license revenue in 2019 under asc 606 is higher than under asc 605 due to the timing of revenue recognition under asc 606 resulting in earlier recognition of the associated royalty costs under asc 605 the support component of subscription revenue is included in license revenue which reduces cost of license as a percentage of total license revenue 

cost of license revenue in 2019 compared to 2018 increased primarily due to a 32 million increase in royalty expense offset by 28 million lower compensation costs 

cost of license revenue as a percentage of license revenue under asc 605 decreased in 2019 compared to 2018 due to higher revenue as recurring subscription revenue increased 

cost of support and cloud services revenue 



our cost of support and cloud services revenue includes costs associated with providing postcontract support such as providing software updates and technical support for both our subscription offerings and our perpetual licenses cost of cloud services including third party hosting costs and cost of software as a service revenue cost of support and cloud services revenue consists of costs such as salaries benefits and computer equipment and facilities associated with customer support and cloud services and the release of support updates including related royalty costs 

under asc 605 the support component of subscription revenue is included in license revenue which increases the cost of support and cloud services as a percentage of total support and cloud services revenue 

in 2019 compared to 2018 cloud services hosting costs increased 32 45 million offset by a decrease in total support and cloud services compensation benefit costs and travel expenses of 1 12 million and in thirdparty consulting costs of 23 15 million 

cost of professional services revenue 



our cost of professional services revenue includes costs such as salaries benefits information technology costs and facilities expenses for our training and consulting personnel and thirdparty subcontractor fees 

cost of professional services revenue is higher in 2019 under asc 606 than under asc 605 due to the timing of professional services revenue recognition and associated professional service costs 

in 2019 compared to 2018 total professional services compensation benefit costs and travel expenses decreased by 11 116 million partially offset by higher thirdparty subcontractor fees which increased by 20 53 million 

sales and marketing 

our sales and marketing expenses primarily include salaries and benefits sales commissions advertising and marketing programs travel and facility costs 

sales and marketing costs are lower under asc 606 than under asc 605 due to the deferral of ongoing commission expenses offset by the amortization of commission costs capitalized upon adoption of asc 606 

in 2019 compared to 2018 total sales and marketing compensation benefit costs and travel expenses under asc 605 increased 6 198 million due to an increase in headcount and marketing expenses increased by 7 21 million 

research and development 

our research and development expenses consist principally of salaries and benefits costs of computer equipment and facility expenses major research and development activities include developing new products and releases and updates of our software that enhance functionality and add features 

in 2019 compared to 2018 total research and development compensation benefit costs and travel expenses decreased 1 29 million primarily due to decreases in headcount and thirdparty consulting services decreased by 33 25 million offsetting these lower costs is a 62 25 million increase in cloud services hosting costs 

general and administrative 



our general and administrative expenses include the costs of our corporate finance information technology human resources legal and administrative functions as well as acquisitionrelated charges bad debt expense and outside professional services including accounting and legal fees 

in 2019 compared to 2018 total general and administrative compensation benefit costs and travel expenses decreased by 14 163 million primarily due to a decrease in performancebased 

compensation and thirdparty consulting services declined by 56 26 million offsetting these lower costs is a 11 14 million increase in hosted subscription costs 

amortization of acquired intangible assets 



amortization of acquired intangible assets reflects the amortization of acquired nonproduct related intangible assets primarily customer and trademarkrelated intangible assets recorded in connection with completed acquisitions the decrease in amortization of acquired intangible assets in 2019 compared to 2018 is due to some assets being fully amortized as well as the impact of foreign currency exchange rates 

restructuring and other charges net 



in january 2019 we relocated to our new worldwide headquarters in the boston seaport district our prior headquarters lease expires in november 2022 as a result we have overlapping rent obligations for those premises and in 2019 we recorded a restructuring charge of 327 million associated with the restructuring of that lease the facility restructuring charge is based on the net present value of remaining lease commitments net of estimated sublease income of 76 million of which 39 million is committed as of the end of fiscal 2019 we continue to seek additional subtenants for the space restructuring charges and estimated cash outflows could increase if we are unable to sublease our prior headquarters as we expect 

the headquarters relocation charges include accelerated depreciation expense and duplicate rent for january associated with exiting our prior headquarters facility 

in the first quarter of 2019 we initiated a restructuring plan to realign our workforce to shift investment to support industrial internet of things and augmented reality strategic opportunities as this was a realignment of resources rather than a costsavings initiative it did not result in significant cost savings the restructuring plan was completed in the first quarter of 2019 in 2019 we recorded restructuring charges of 157 million related to this restructuring plan 

in 2019 we made cash payments related to restructuring charges of 247 million at september 30 2019 accrued restructuring totaled 311 million of which we expect to pay 12 million within the next twelve months 

interest expense 

interest expense includes interest under our credit facility and senior notes we had 673 million of total debt at september 30 2019 compared to 648 million at september 30 2018 

the average interest rate on our total borrowings was 54 in 2019 52 in 2018 and 49 in 2017 

other income expense net 



foreign currency net losses include costs of hedging contracts certain realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains or losses and foreign exchange gains or losses resulting from the required periodend currency remeasurement of the assets and liabilities of our subsidiaries that use the us dollar as their functional currency because a large portion of our revenue and expenses is transacted in foreign currencies we engage in hedging transactions involving the use of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates changes in the balance year over year are due to required periodend currency remeasurement of the assets and liabilities of our subsidiaries that use the us dollar as their functional currency hedging costs decreased 40 million in 2019 compared to 2018 due to implementation of favorable net investment hedges of foreign currency exposure 

interest income represents earnings on the investment of our available cash balances 

other nonoperating income expense net is primarily made up of other nonoperating gains and losses 

income taxes 

tax provision and effective income tax rate 



in 2019 our tax rate is higher than the statutory federal income tax rate of 21 due in large part to the scheduling of the reversal of existing temporary differences resulting in deferred tax liabilities that 

cannot be offset against deferred tax assets requiring an increase to the us valuation allowance us tax reform as described below and foreign withholding taxes an obligation of the us parent this is offset by our corporate structure in which our foreign taxes are at a net effective tax rate lower than the us rate the excess tax benefit related to stockbased compensation and the indirect effects of the adoption of asc 606 a significant amount of our foreign earnings is generated by our subsidiaries organized in ireland in 2019 the foreign rate differential predominantly relates to these irish earnings 

on december 22 2017 the united states enacted tax reform legislation through the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act which significantly changed existing us tax laws by a reduction of the corporate tax rate the implementation of a new system of taxation for nonus earnings the imposition of a onetime tax on the deemed repatriation of undistributed earnings of nonus subsidiaries and the expansion of the limitations on the deductibility of executive compensation and interest expense as we have a september 30 fiscal yearend a blended us statutory federal rate of approximately 245 applies for our fiscal year ended september 30 2018 and 21 for subsequent fiscal years the tax act also provides that net operating losses generated in years ending after december 31 2017 our fiscal 2018 will be carried forward indefinitely and can no longer be carried back and that net operating losses generated in years beginning after december 31 2017 can only reduce taxable income by up to 80 when utilized in a future period the tax act includes a provision to tax global intangible lowtax income gilti of foreign subsidiaries a deduction for foreignderived intangible income fdii and the base erosion antiabuse tax beat measure that taxes certain payments between a us corporation and its foreign subsidiaries the gilti fdii and beat provisions were effective for us beginning october 1 2018 our accounting policy is to treat tax on gilti as a current period cost included in tax expense in the year incurred 

in 2018 we provided no federal income taxes payable as a result of the deemed repatriation of undistributed earnings as the tax was offset by a combination of current year losses and existing attributes which had a full valuation allowance recorded against the related deferred tax assets in 2018 we recorded a state income taxes payable on the deemed repatriation of 17 million we also recorded a deferred tax benefit of 141 million for the impact of the tax act on our net us deferred income tax balances this was primarily attributable to the reduction of the federal tax rate on the net deferred tax liability in the us and the ability to realize net operating losses from the reversal of existing deferred tax assets which can now be carried forward indefinitely and can therefore be netted against deferred tax liabilities for indefinite lived intangible assets 

the us securities and exchange commission issued rules that allow for a period of up to one year after the enactment date of the tax act to finalize the recording of the related tax impacts we finalized recording the impacts of the tax act in the quarter ended december 29 2018 and did not record any significant adjustments 

in october 2016 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu 201616 income taxes topic 740 intraentity transfers of assets other than inventory the purpose of asu 201616 is to simplify the income tax accounting of an intraentity transfer of an asset other than inventory and to record its effect when the transfer occurs we adopted this amendment beginning in the first quarter of 2019 using the modified retrospective method with a cumulate effect adjustment to accumulated deficit of 723 million with a corresponding increase of 753 million to deferred tax assets a 60 million decrease to income tax assets and a 30 million decrease to income tax liabilities the adjustment primarily relates to deductible amortization of intangible assets in ireland post adoption our effective tax rate no longer includes the benefit of this amortization 

valuation allowance 

we have concluded based on the weight of available evidence that a full valuation allowance continues to be required against our us net deferred tax assets as they are not more likely than not to be realized in the future we will continue to reassess our valuation allowance requirements each financial reporting period however we believe that there is a reasonable possibility that within the next 12 months sufficient positive evidence may become available to allow us to reach a conclusion that a significant portion of the valuation allowance will no longer be needed release of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a decrease to income tax expense for the period the release is recorded however the exact timing and amount of the valuation allowance release are subject to change on the basis of the level of profitability that we are able to actually achieve 

tax audits and examinations 

in the normal course of business ptc and its subsidiaries are examined by various taxing authorities including the internal revenue service irs in the u s we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate we are currently under audit by tax authorities in several jurisdictions audits by tax authorities typically involve examination of the deductibility of certain permanent items transfer pricing limitations on net operating losses and tax credits although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in material changes in our estimates 

in the fourth quarter of 2016 we received an assessment of approximately 12 million from the tax authorities in south korea the assessment relates to various tax issues primarily foreign withholding taxes we have appealed and intend to vigorously defend our positions we believe that upon completion of a multilevel appeal process it is more likely than not that our positions will be sustained accordingly we have not recorded a tax reserve for this matter we paid this assessment in the first quarter of 2017 pending resolution of the appeal process if the south korean tax authorities were to prevail the potential additional exposure through 2019 would be approximately 13 million  

our future effective income tax rate 

our future effective income tax rate may be materially impacted by the amount of income taxes associated with our foreign earnings which are taxed at rates different from the us federal statutory income tax rate as well as the timing and extent of the realization of deferred tax assets and changes in the tax law further our tax rate may fluctuate within a fiscal year including from quarter to quarter due to items arising from discrete events including settlements of tax audits and assessments the resolution or identification of tax position uncertainties and acquisitions of other companies 

in july 2015 the us tax court issued an opinion in altera corp v commissioner related to the treatment of stockbased compensation expense in an intercompany costsharing arrangement the opinion invalidated part of a treasury regulation requiring stockbased compensation to be included in any qualified intercompany costsharing arrangement the company previously recorded a tax benefit based on the opinion in the case which was offset by a corresponding increase in the valuation allowance against us deferred tax assets on june 7 2019 the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit reversed the us tax court’s decision on july 22 2019 altera corp filed a petition for an en banc rehearing before the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit which was denied on november 12 2019 altera corp has 90 days from this date to petition the us supreme court for review of the decision due to the fact that the altera decision is not yet final as well as uncertainty surrounding the status of the current regulations and questions related to jurisdiction given the company does not reside in the ninth circuit we have determined no adjustment is required to the consolidated financial statements as a result of this ruling the company will continue to monitor ongoing developments and potential impacts to its consolidated financial statements 

operating measures 

arr 

to help investors understand and assess the success of our subscription transition we provide an arr operating measure on september 5 2019 we revised the arr definition arr represents the annualized value of our portfolio of recurring customer arrangements as of the end of the reporting period including subscription software cloud and support contracts this is a change from our prior definition where arr for a quarter was calculated by dividing the portion of nongaap software revenue attributable to subscription and support under asc 605 for the quarter by the number of days in the quarter and multiplying by 365 the definition change did not materially change the amount of arr reported under asc 605 for the period 

we believe arr is a valuable operating metric to measure the health of a subscription business because it captures expected subscription and support cash generation from new customers existing customer expansions and includes the impact of total churn which reflects churn offset by the impact of any pricing increases 

because this measure represents the annualized value of recurring customer contracts as of the end of a reporting period arr does not represent revenue for any particular period or remaining revenue that will be recognized in future periods 

subscription bookings and subscription acv 

on september 5 2019 we announced a revision to our reporting measures effective in 2020 we will no longer provide bookings but instead we will provide arr which we believe provides a more comprehensive view of a subscription business 

given the difference in revenue recognition between the sale of a perpetual software license and a subscription during our transition to a subscription business model we used bookings for internal planning forecasting and reporting of new license and cloud services transactions as subscription bookings includes cloud services bookings 

in order to normalize between perpetual and subscription licenses we define subscription bookings as the subscription annualized contract value subscription acv of new subscription contracts multiplied by a conversion factor of 2 we arrived at the conversion factor of 2 by considering a number of variables including pricing support length of term and renewal rates in 2019 2018 and 2017 the average subscription contract term was approximately two years 

we define subscription acv as the total value of a new subscription contract which may include annual values that increase over time and without regard to contractual termination options divided by the term of the contract in days multiplied by 365 if the term of the subscription contract is less than a year and is not associated with an existing contract the booking is equal to the total contract value beginning in the third quarter of 2018 minimum acv commitments under our strategic alliance agreement with rockwell automation are included in subscription acv if the periodtodate minimum acv commitment exceeds actual acv sold under the agreement 

we define license and subscription bookings as subscription bookings plus perpetual license bookings 

because subscription bookings is a metric we use to approximate the value of subscription sales if sold as perpetual licenses it does not represent the actual revenue that will be recognized with respect to subscription sales or that would be recognized if the sales were perpetual licenses nor does the annualized value of monthly software rental bookings represent the value of any such booking 

nongaap financial measures 

the nongaap financial measures presented in the discussion of our results of operations and the respective most directly comparable gaap measures are 

 the nongaap financial measures exclude fair value adjustments related to acquired deferred revenue and deferred costs stockbased compensation expense amortization of acquired intangible assets expense acquisitionrelated charges pension plan terminationrelated costs a legal accrual restructuring charges nonoperating credit facility refinancing costs identified discrete charges included in nonoperating other expense net and the related tax effects of the preceding items and any other identified tax items 

these items are normally included in the comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with gaap our management excludes these items when evaluating our ongoing performance andor predicting our earnings trends and therefore excludes them when presenting nongaap financial measures management uses nongaap financial measures in conjunction with our gaap results as should investors 

settlement revenue exclusions in q418 we settled a previously disclosed dispute with respect to a customer receivable the settlement included partial payment of the receivable and new software purchases the net revenue writedown recorded in q418 was 93 million comprised of a 145 million professional services revenue writedown partially offset by new subscription revenue of 52 million we excluded the professional services revenue writedown because the writedown related to revenue that was recorded in periods prior to fiscal 2017 and is not reflective of current operating performance and 

excluded the new subscription revenue because it mitigated the impact of the professional services revenue writedown 

fair value of acquired deferred revenue is a purchase accounting adjustment recorded to reduce acquired deferred revenue to the fair value of the remaining obligation so our gaap revenue after an acquisition does not reflect the full amount of revenue that would have been reported if the acquired deferred revenue was not written down to fair value we believe excluding these adjustments to revenue from these contracts and associated costs in fair value adjustment to deferred services cost  is useful to investors as an additional means to assess revenue trends of our business 

stockbased compensation is a noncash expense relating to stockbased awards issued to executive officers employees and outside directors consisting of restricted stock stock options and restricted stock units we exclude this expense as it is a noncash expense and we assess our internal operations excluding this expense and believe it facilitates comparisons to the performance of other companies in our industry 

amortization of acquired intangible assets is a noncash expense that is impacted by the timing and magnitude of our acquisitions we believe the assessment of our operations excluding these costs is relevant to our assessment of internal operations and comparisons to the performance of other companies in our industry 

acquisitionrelated and other transactional charges included in general and administrative costs are direct costs of potential and completed acquisitions and expenses related to acquisition integration activities including transaction fees due diligence costs severance and professional fees subsequent adjustments to our initial estimated amount of contingent consideration associated with specific acquisitions are also included within acquisitionrelated charges other transactional charges include thirdparty costs related to structuring unusual transactions we do not include these costs when reviewing our operating results internally the occurrence and amount of these costs will vary depending on the timing and size of acquisitions 

us pension plan terminationrelated costs include charges related to our plan that we began terminating in the second quarter of 2014 costs associated with termination of the plan are not considered part of our regular operations 

restructuring and other charges net include excess facility restructuring charges headquarters relocation charges and severance costs resulting from reductions of personnel driven by modifications to our business strategy headquarters relocation charges are noncash accelerated depreciation expense recorded in anticipation of exiting our prior headquarters facility due to changes in the estimated useful lives of fixed assets we do not include these costs when reviewing our operating results internally these costs may vary in size based on our restructuring plan 

nonoperating credit facility refinancing costs are nonoperating charges we record as a result of the refinancing of our credit facility we assess our internal operations excluding these costs and believe it facilitates comparisons to the performance of other companies in our industry 

income tax adjustments include the tax impact of the items above and assumes that we are profitable on a nongaap basis in the us and one foreign jurisdiction it also eliminates the effect of the valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets in those jurisdictions additionally we exclude other material tax items that we do not include when reviewing our operating results internally 

we use these nongaap financial measures and we believe that they assist our investors to make periodtoperiod comparisons of our operational performance because they provide a view of our operating results without items that are not in our view indicative of our core operating results we believe that these nongaap financial measures help illustrate underlying trends in our business and we use the measures to establish budgets and operational goals communicated internally and externally for managing our business and evaluating our performance we believe that providing nongaap financial measures also affords investors a view of our operating results that may be more easily compared to the results of other companies in our industry that use similar financial measures to supplement their gaap results 

the items excluded from the nongaap financial measures often have a material impact on our financial results and such items often recur accordingly the nongaap financial measures included in this annual report should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for or superior to the 

comparable measures prepared in accordance with gaap the following tables reconcile each of these nongaap financial measures to its most closely comparable gaap measure on our financial statements 





 

 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we have prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america in preparing our financial statements we make estimates assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our reported revenues results of operations and net income as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet these estimates assumptions and judgments are made based on our historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances these estimates may change as new events occur or additional information is obtained and we may periodically be faced with uncertainties the outcomes of which are not within our control and may not be known for a prolonged period of time 

the accounting policies methods and estimates used to prepare our financial statements are described generally in note 2 summary of significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report the most important accounting judgments and estimates that we made in preparing the financial statements involved 



a critical accounting policy is one that is both material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires us to make subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies require us to make assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time of the estimate and different estimates that we could have used or changes in the estimates that are reasonably likely to occur may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process actual results could differ from those estimates 

accounting policies guidelines and interpretations related to our critical accounting policies and estimates are generally subject to numerous sources of authoritative guidance and are often reexamined by accounting standards rule makers and regulators these rule makers andor regulators may promulgate interpretations guidance or regulations that may result in changes to our accounting policies which could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 

revenue recognition 

nature of products and services 

our sources of revenue include 1 subscription 2 perpetual license 3 support for perpetual licenses and 4 professional services revenue is derived from the licensing of computer software products and from related support andor professional services contracts effective october 1 2018 we record revenues in accordance with the guidance provided by asc 606 revenue from contracts with customer in accordance with asc 606 revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised products or services the amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration that we expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for these products or services to achieve the core principle of this standard we apply the following five steps 

1 identify the contract with the customer 

2 identify the performance obligations in the contract 

3 determine the transaction price 

4 allocation the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract 

5 recognize revenue when or as we satisfy a performance obligation 

we enter into contracts that include combinations of products support and professional services which are accounted for as separate performance obligations with differing revenue recognition patterns referenced below 



through 2018 we recorded revenues for software related deliverables in accordance with the guidance provided by asc 985605 softwarerevenue recognition and revenues for nonsoftware deliverables in accordance with asc 60525  revenue recognition multipleelement arrangements under those standards revenue is recorded when the following criteria are met 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 2 delivery has occurred generally fob shipping point or electronic distribution 3 the fee is fixed or determinable and 4 collection is probable we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with determining the amounts of software license and services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period 

judgments and estimates 

our contracts with customers for subscriptions typically include commitments to transfer termbased onpremise software licenses bundled with support andor cloud services onpremise software is determined to be a distinct performance obligation from support which is sold for the same term of the subscription for subscription arrangements which include cloud services we assess whether the cloud 

component is highly interrelated with onpremise term software licenses other than a limited population of subscriptions the cloud component is not currently deemed to be interrelated with the onpremise term software and as a result cloud services are accounted for as a distinct performance obligation from the software and support components of the subscription 

judgment is required to allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation we use the estimated standalone selling price method to allocate the transaction price for items that are not sold separately the estimated standalone selling price is determined using all information reasonably available to us including market conditions and other observable inputs the corresponding revenues are recognized as the related performance obligations are satisfied we determined that 50 to 55 of the estimated standalone selling price for subscriptions that contain distinct license and support performance obligations are attributable to software licenses and 45 to 50  depending upon the product offering is attributable to support for those licenses 

our multiyear noncancellable onpremise subscription contracts provide customers with an annual right to exchange software within the original subscription with other software although the exchange right is limited to software products within a similar product grouping the exchange right is not limited to products with substantially similar features and functionality as those originally delivered we determined that this right to exchange previously delivered software for different software represents variable consideration to be accounted for as a liability we have identified a standard portfolio of contracts with common characteristics and applied the expected value method of determining variable consideration associated with this right additionally where there are isolated situations that are outside of the standard portfolio of contracts due to contract size longer contract duration or other unique contractual terms we use the most likely amount method to determine the amount of variable consideration in both circumstances the variable consideration included in the transaction price is constrained to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved 

accounting for income taxes 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to calculate our income tax expense based on taxable income by jurisdiction there are many transactions and calculations about which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain as a result our calculations involve estimates by management some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenuesharing costreimbursement and transfer pricing arrangements among related entities and the differing tax treatment of revenue and cost items across various jurisdictions if we were compelled to revise or to account differently for our arrangements that revision could affect our tax liability 

the income tax accounting process also involves estimating our actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheets we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized we must establish a valuation allowance as a charge to income tax expense 

as of september 30 2019 we have a valuation allowance of 1461 million against net deferred tax assets in the us and a valuation allowance of 316 million against net deferred tax assets in certain foreign jurisdictions we have concluded based on the weight of available evidence that a full valuation allowance continues to be required against our us net deferred tax assets as they are not more likely than not to be realized in the future we will continue to reassess our valuation allowance requirements each financial reporting period 

the valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets of certain foreign jurisdictions is established primarily for our net operating loss carryforwards the majority of which do not expire there are limitations imposed on the utilization of such net operating losses that could further restrict the recognition of any tax benefits 

prior to the passage of the us tax act the company asserted that substantially all of the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries were considered indefinitely invested and accordingly no deferred taxes were provided pursuant to the provisions of the us tax act these earnings were subjected to a onetime transition tax we maintain our assertion to permanently reinvest these earnings outside the us unless repatriation can be done with no significant tax cost with the exception of a 

foreign holding company formed in 2018 and our taiwan subsidiary if we decide to repatriate any additional nonus earnings in the future we may be required to establish a deferred tax liability on such earnings the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability on the undistributed earnings would not be material 

in the normal course of business ptc and its subsidiaries are examined by various taxing authorities including the internal revenue service irs in the us we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate we are currently under audit by tax authorities in several jurisdictions audits by tax authorities typically involve examination of the deductibility of certain permanent items transfer pricing limitations on net operating losses and tax credits although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in material changes in our estimates 

valuation of assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations 

in accordance with business combination accounting we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values determining these fair values requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets 

our identifiable intangible assets acquired consist of developed technology core technology tradenames customer lists and contracts and software support agreements and related relationships developed technology consists of products that have reached technological feasibility core technology represents a combination of processes inventions and trade secrets related to the design and development of acquired products customer lists and contracts and software support agreements and related relationships represent the underlying relationships and agreements with customers of the acquired company’s installed base we have generally valued intangible assets using a discounted cash flow model critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to 

 in addition we estimate the useful lives of our intangible assets based upon the expected period over which we anticipate generating economic benefits from the related intangible asset 

net tangible assets consist of the fair values of tangible assets less the fair values of assumed liabilities and obligations except for deferred revenues net tangible assets were generally valued by us at the respective carrying amounts recorded by the acquired company if we believed that their carrying values approximated their fair values at the acquisition date the values assigned to deferred revenue reflect an amount equivalent to the estimated cost plus an appropriate profit margin to perform the services related to the acquired company’s software support contracts 

in addition uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date and we reevaluate these items quarterly with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill provided that we are within the measurement period up to one year from the acquisition date and we continue to collect information in order to determine their estimated values subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the estimated value of uncertain tax positions or tax related valuation allowances whichever comes first changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of operations 

our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable at that time but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions estimates or actual results 

when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a finitelived intangible asset may not be recoverable we perform an assessment of the asset for potential impairment this assessment is based on projected undiscounted future cash flows over the asset’s remaining life if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its undiscounted cash flows we record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset determined using projected discounted future cash flows of the asset 

liquidity and capital resources 

  

cash and cash equivalents 

we invest our cash with highly rated financial institutions and in diversified domestic and international money market mutual funds cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less in addition we hold investments in marketable securities totaling approximately 57 million with an average maturity of 12 months at september 30 2019  cash and cash equivalents totaled 270 million  compared to 260 million at september 30 2018  reflecting 285 million in operating cash flow 25 million of net borrowings under our credit facility 13 million in proceeds from issuance of common stock and 10 million from settlements of net investment hedges offset by 115 million used for repurchases of common stock 87 million used for acquisitions 64 million used for capital expenditures 44 million used to pay withholding taxes on stockbased awards that vested in the period 8 million used for purchases of investments 2 million used for the payment of contingent consideration and 1 million used to purchase marketable securities net of proceeds from maturities 

cash provided by operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities was 285 million in 2019 compared to 248 million in 2018  the increase in 2019 is primarily due to higher cash collection of accounts receivable of approximately 80 million offset by an increase in payments related to payables and accruals due to timing a decrease in net income of 79 million and an increase in restructuring payments of 22 million year over year 

restructuring payments totaled 25 million in 2019 compared to 3 million in 2018 cash paid for income taxes was 39 million in 2019 compared to 23 million in 2018 

cash used by investing activities   



the 2019 increase in property plant and equipment payments is primarily attributable to capitalized expenditures related to construction of our new worldwide headquarters in the boston seaport district a portion of which is offset by landlord reimbursements included in cash from operations above we used 70 million to acquire frustum and an additional 17 million for two smaller acquisitions as described in note 6 acquisitions included in the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report 

our expenditures for property and equipment consist primarily of facility improvements office equipment computer equipment and software 

cash used by financing activities 



the net borrowings in 2019 reflect borrowings of 205 million under our credit facility to fund the working capital requirements and frustum acquisition offset by repayments of 180 million in 2019 we repurchased 115 million of our common stock paid 44 million in withholding taxes in connection with stockbased awards received 13 million in proceeds from issuance of common stock under our espp and made 2 million in contingent consideration payments 

credit agreement 

in november 2019 we amended and restated our existing credit facility to increase the revolving loan commitment from 700 million to 1 billion and amend other provisions the credit facility is a multicurrency credit facility with a syndicate of sixteen banks for which jpmorgan chase bank na acts as administrative agent outstanding revolving loan amounts may be repaid in whole or in part without penalty or premium prior to the september 13 2023 maturity date when all remaining amounts outstanding will be due and payable in full 

we use the credit facility for general corporate purposes including acquisitions of businesses share repurchases and working capital requirements as of september 30 2019 we had 1731 million in revolving loans outstanding under the credit facility the fair value of which approximated its book value as of september 30 2019 we had approximately 527 million undrawn of which 512 million would be available to borrow the availability of which is reduced by letters of credit and certain other longterm liabilities giving effect to the onshape acquisition and the amendment to the credit facility we had approximately 357 million available to borrow 

any borrowings by ptc inc or certain of our foreign subsidiaries under the credit facility would be guaranteed respectively by our material domestic subsidiaries that become parties to the subsidiary guaranty if any andor by ptc inc borrowings are also secured by first priority liens on property of ptc and certain of our material domestic subsidiaries including 100 of the voting equity interests of certain of our domestic subsidiaries and 65 of our material firsttier foreign subsidiaries loans under the credit facility bear interest at variable rates that reset every 30 to 180 days depending on the rate and period selected by us and based upon our total leverage ratio during 2019 the weighted average annual interest rate for all borrowings outstanding was 538 and as of september 30 2019 the rate on the credit facility was 344  we also pay a quarterly commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the credit facility ranging from 0175 to 030 per year based on our total leverage ratio 

the credit facility imposes customary covenants that limit our ability to incur liens or guarantee obligations pay dividends and make other distributions make investments and engage in certain other transactions in addition we and our material domestic subsidiaries may not invest in or loan to our foreign subsidiaries in aggregate amounts exceeding 100 million for any purpose and an additional 200 million for acquisitions of businesses we also must maintain the following financial ratios 



any failure to comply with such covenants would prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds and would constitute a default permitting the lenders to among other things accelerate the amounts outstanding and terminate the credit facility as of september 30 2019 we were in compliance with all financial and operating covenants of the credit facility 

outstanding notes 

on may 12 2016 we issued 500 million of 600 senior notes due 2024 the “2024 6 notes” in a registered offering and used the net proceeds to repay indebtedness under our senior credit facility as of september 30 2019 unamortized deferred financing fees associated with the offering and presented as a direct reduction from the carrying amount of the 2024 6 notes were 40 million  

the 2024 6 notes are unsecured mature on may 15 2024 and bear interest at a rate of 600 per annum payable semiannually november and may we may redeem some or all of the 2024 6 notes at redemption prices specified in the 2024 6 notes plus accrued and unpaid interest in addition if we undergo a change of control we will be required to make an offer to purchase all the 2024 6 notes at a price equal to 101 of the principal amount of the 2024 6 notes plus accrued and unpaid interest 

the notes were issued under an indenture that contains customary covenants subject to certain exceptions our ability to incur certain additional debt is limited unless after giving pro forma effect to such incurrence and the application of the proceeds thereof the ratio of our ebitda to our consolidated fixed charges as both terms are defined in the indenture is not greater than 200 to 100 the indenture also restricts our ability to incur liens pay dividends or make certain other distributions sell assets or engage in saleleaseback transactions any failure to comply with these and other covenants included in the indenture could constitute an event of default that could result in the acceleration of the payment of the aggregate principal amount of 2024 6 notes then outstanding and accrued interest as of september 30 2019 we were in compliance with all such covenants 

share repurchase authorization 

our articles of organization authorize us to issue up to 500 million shares of our common stock our board of directors has authorized us to repurchase up to 1500 million of our common stock for the october 1 2017 through september 30 2020 period we use cash from operations and borrowings under our credit facility to make such repurchases all shares of our common stock repurchased are automatically restored to the status of authorized and unissued 

in 2019 we repurchased 14 million shares in the open market for 115 million in addition in 2019 and 2018 we repurchased 30 million and 94 million shares respectively under accelerated share repurchase agreements 

expectations for fiscal 2020 

we believe that existing cash and cash equivalents together with cash generated from operations and amounts available under the credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements which we expect to be 28 million in 2020 through at least the next twelve months and to meet our known longterm capital requirements 

on november 1 2019 we acquired onshape for approximately 470 million net of cash acquired in connection with the acquisition we borrowed 455 million under our existing credit facility and we also increased the loan commitment to 1 billion on november 13 2019 we plan to suspend our share repurchase program in 2020 in order to accelerate debt repayments 

our expected uses of cash could change our cash position could be reduced and we could incur additional debt obligations if we purchase our outstanding shares or retire debt or engage in strategic transactions any of which could be commenced suspended or completed at any time any such purchases or retirement of debt will depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors we also evaluate possible strategic transactions on an ongoing basis and at any given time may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to possible strategic transactions the amounts involved in any share or debt repurchases or strategic transactions may be material 

we ended 2019 with a cash balance of 270 million and marketable securities of 57 million a significant portion of our cash is generated and held outside of the united states at september 30 2019 we had cash and cash equivalents of 400 million in the united states 830 million in europe 1220 million in asia pacific rim including india and 250 million in other nonus countries all of the marketable securities are held in europe we have substantial cash requirements in the united states but we believe that the combination of our existing us cash and cash equivalents marketable securities and future us operating cash flows and cash available under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our ongoing us operating expenses and known capital requirements 

contractual obligations 

at september 30 2019  our contractual obligations were as follows 



  

 as of september 30 2019  we had letters of credit and bank guarantees outstanding of approximately 151 million of which 11 million was collateralized 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have not created and are not party to any specialpurpose or offbalance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital incurring debt or operating parts of our business that are not consolidated to 

the extent of our ownership interest therein into our financial statements we have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby we have subordinated retained interests derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks contingent liabilities or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing liquidity market risk or credit risk support to us 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in accordance with recently issued accounting pronouncements we will be required to comply with certain changes in accounting rules and regulations some of which are expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements refer to note 2 summary of significant accounting policies to the condensed consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for all recently issued accounting pronouncements which is incorporated herein by reference 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we face exposure to financial market risks including adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 

foreign currency exchange risk 

our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to western european countries japan israel china and canada we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates that arise from receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies we do not enter into or hold foreign currency derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes nor do we enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge future cash flow or forecast transactions 

our nonus revenues generally are transacted through our nonus subsidiaries and typically are denominated in their local currency in addition expenses that are incurred by our nonus subsidiaries typically are denominated in their local currency in 2019 approximately 60 of our revenue and 40 of our expenses were transacted in currencies other than the us dollar historically twothirds of our revenue and half of our expenses were transacted in currencies other than us dollars currency translation affects our reported results because we report our results of operations in us dollars historically our most significant currency risk has been changes in the euro and japanese yen relative to the us dollar based on current revenue and expense levels excluding restructuring charges and stockbased compensation a 010 change in the usd to european exchange rates and a 10 yen change in the yen to usd exchange rate would impact operating income by approximately 17 million and 7 million respectively 

our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations arises in part from intercompany transactions with most intercompany transactions occurring between a us dollar functional currency entity and a foreign currency denominated entity intercompany transactions typically are denominated in the local currency of the nonus dollar functional currency subsidiary in order to centralize foreign currency risk also both ptc the parent company and our nonus subsidiaries may transact business with our customers and vendors in a currency other than their functional currency transaction risk in addition we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results and balances of our nonus subsidiaries are translated into us dollars translation risk if sales to customers outside of the united states increase our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will increase 

our foreign currency risk management strategy is principally designed to mitigate the future potential financial impact of changes in the us dollar value of balances denominated in foreign currency resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates our foreign currency hedging program uses forward contracts to manage the foreign currency exposures that exist as part of our ongoing business operations the contracts primarily are denominated in canadian dollars and european currencies and have maturities of less than three months 

generally we do not designate foreign currency forward contracts as hedges for accounting purposes and changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized immediately in earnings because we enter into forward contracts only as an economic hedge any gain or loss on the underlying foreigndenominated balance would be offset by the loss or gain on the forward contract gains and 

losses on forward contracts and foreign denominated receivables and payables are included in foreign currency net losses 

as of september 30 2019 and 2018  we had outstanding forward contracts for derivatives not designated as hedging instruments with notional amounts equivalent to the following   

as of september 30 2019 and 2018  we had outstanding forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges with notional amounts equivalent to the following 

debt 

in addition to the 500 million due under our 2024 6 notes as of september 30 2019  we had 173 million outstanding under our credit facility as of november 15 2019 we have 628 million outstanding under our credit facility due to the onshape acquisition loans under the credit facility bear interest at variable rates which reset every 30 to 180 days depending on the rate and period selected by us these loans are subject to interest rate risk as interest rates will be adjusted at each rollover date to the extent such amounts are not repaid as of september 30 2019  the annual rate on the credit facility loans was 344  if there was a hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates the annual net impact to earnings and cash flows would be 17 million this hypothetical change in cash flows and earnings has been calculated based on the borrowings outstanding at september 30 2019 and a 100 basis point per annum change in interest rate applied over a oneyear period 

cash and cash equivalents 

as of september 30 2019  cash equivalents were invested in highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased we invest our cash with highly rated financial institutions in north america europe and asiapacific and in diversified domestic and international money market mutual funds at september 30 2019  we had cash and cash equivalents of 400 million in the united states 830 million in europe 1220 million in asia pacific rim including india and 250 million in other nonus countries given the short maturities and investment grade quality of the portfolio holdings at september 30 2019  a hypothetical 10 change in interest rates would not materially affect the fair value of our cash and cash equivalents 

our invested cash is subject to interest rate fluctuations and for nonus operations foreign currency risk in a declining interest rate environment we would experience a decrease in interest income the 

opposite holds true in a rising interest rate environment over the past several years the us federal reserve board european central bank and bank of england have changed certain benchmark interest rates which have led to declines and increases in market interest rates these changes in market interest rates have resulted in fluctuations in interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents interest income will continue to fluctuate based on changes in market interest rates and levels of cash available for investment our consolidated cash balances were impacted favorably by 26 million and 78 million in 2019 and 2018  respectively and unfavorably by 11 million in 2017  due to changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar particularly the euro and the japanese yen

risk factors 

tableend 

the following are important factors we have identified that could affect our future results you should consider them carefully when evaluating an investment in ptc securities or any forwardlooking statements made by us including those contained in this annual report because these factors could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or the performance projected in forwardlooking statements the risks described below are not the only risks we face additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business financial condition andor operating results holders of the 600 senior notes due 2024 the “2024 6 notes” that we issued in may 2016 should also consider the risk factors related to those notes described in the prospectus supplement we filed with the securities and exchange commission on may 5 2016 which are incorporated herein by reference 

i operational considerations 

our operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter making future operating results difficult to predict failure to meet market expectations could cause the price of our securities to decline 

our quarterly operating results historically have fluctuated and are likely to continue to fluctuate depending on a number of factors including 

 accordingly our quarterly results are difficult to predict prior to the end of the quarter and we may be unable to confirm or adjust expectations with respect to our operating results for a particular quarter until that quarter has closed any failure to meet our quarterly revenue or earnings targets could adversely impact the market price of our securities 

we now offer our solutions as subscriptions which has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our revenue and earnings in the transition period and make predicting our revenue and earnings more difficult 

we began offering most of our solutions under a subscription option in 2015 in addition to a perpetual license option under a subscription customers pay a periodic fee for the right to use our software and receive support or to use our cloud services and have us manage the application for a specified period through 2018 under a subscription revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the subscription while under a perpetual license revenue is generally recognized upon purchase a significant number of our customers have elected to purchase our solutions as subscriptions rather than under perpetual licenses as a result our license revenues have declined our support revenue which comprises a significant portion of our revenue has also decreased due to support services being included in the subscription offering and to customers converting their support contracts into subscriptions we discontinued sales of perpetual licenses for most of our products in the americas and western europe as of january 1 2018 and intend to discontinue sales of such perpetual licenses in all remaining geographic regions as of january 2019 which will likely accelerate these effects on our revenue as described in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations revenue sources and recognition and in note b   summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements we adopted asc 606 effective october 1 2018 which will change how we account for revenue transactions and will affect the timing of our revenue period to period 

we may not be able to predict subscription renewal rates and their impact on our future revenue and operating results 

although our subscription solutions are designed to increase the number of customers that purchase our solutions as subscriptions and create a recurring revenue stream that increases and is more predictable over time our customers are not required to renew their subscriptions for our solutions and they may elect not to renew when or as we expect customer renewal rates may decline or fluctuate due to a number of factors including offering pricing competitive offerings customer satisfaction and reductions in customer spending levels or customer activity due to economic downturns the adverse impact of import tariffs or other market uncertainty if our customers do not renew their subscriptions when or as we expect or if they renew on less favorable terms our revenues and earnings may decline 

our long range financial targets are predicated on bookings and revenue growth and operating margin improvements that we may fail to achieve which could reduce our expected earnings and cause us to fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors and cause the price of our securities to decline 

we are projecting longterm bookings revenue and earnings growth our projections are based on the expected growth potential in the iot and ar markets as well as more modest growth in our core cad and plm markets we may not achieve the expected bookings and revenue growth if the markets we serve do not grow at expected rates if customers do not purchase renew or expand subscriptions as we expect if we are not able to deliver solutions desired by customers and potential customers andor if acquired businesses do not generate the revenue growth that we expect 

our longterm operating margin improvement targets are predicated on operating leverage as longrange revenue increases and on improved operating efficiencies particularly within our sales organization and on service margin improvements services margins are significantly lower than license and support margins future projected improvements in our operating margin as a percent of revenue are based in part on our ability to improve services margins by reducing the amount of direct services that we perform through expansion of our service partner program and improving the profitability of services that we perform if our services revenue increases as a percentage of total revenue andor if we are unable to improve our services margins our overall operating margin may not increase to the levels we expect or may decrease additionally if we do not achieve lower sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue through productivity initiatives we may not achieve our operating margin targets if operating margins do not improve our earnings could be adversely affected and the price of our securities could decline 

our significant investment in our iot business may not generate the revenues we expect which could adversely affect our business and financial results 

we have made significant investments in recent years in our iot business including acquisitions totaling approximately 550 million 

the internet of things is a relatively new market and there are a significant number of competitors in the market if the market does not expand as rapidly as we or others expect or if customers adopt competitive solutions rather than our solutions our iot business may not generate the revenues we expect further our customers and potential customers often begin the process of implementing iot with a proofofconcept evaluation in some cases with multiple different technology vendors our success in this emerging market will depend on our ability to engage with customers to ensure that their investment moves beyond planning to broader deployment and yields value at their desired speed and expected costs 

further one market for our iot business is as a platform provider to a broad ecosystem of application and solutions providers this market relies on an extensive and differentiated partner ecosystem to enable us to access markets and customers beyond our traditional markets customers and buyers we may be unable to expand our partner ecosystem as we expect and developers may not adopt our iot solutions as we expect which would adversely affect our ability to realize revenue from our investments in this business 

we depend on sales within the discrete manufacturing sector and our business could be adversely affected if manufacturing activity does not grow or if it contracts or if manufacturers are adversely affected by other economic factors 

a large amount of our sales are to customers in the discrete manufacturing sector if this economic sector does not grow or if it contracts our customers in this sector may as they have in the past reduce or defer purchases of our products and services which adversely affects our business further us manufacturers have been adversely affected by tariffs recently imposed on certain imported goods which could cause them to reduce their purchases of our software which would adversely affect our revenue and earnings 

changes in accounting principles and guidance or their interpretation or implementation may materially adversely affect our reported results of operations or financial position 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us these principles are subject to interpretation by the us securities and exchange commission and various bodies formed to create and interpret appropriate accounting 

principles and guidance a change in these principles or guidance or in their interpretations may have a significant effect on our reported results as well as our processes and related controls 

for example in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 asc 606    this new standard is both technical and complex asc 606 became effective for us on october 1 2018 we are adopting asc 606 using the modified retrospective transition method the adoption of this new standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements including the way we account for arrangements involving our termbased subscription licenses deferred revenue and sales commissions in connection with the adoption of asc 606 we are implementing new processes systems and internal controls such changes and any difficulties implementing such changes could materially adversely affect our reported financial results our ability to comply with regulatory reporting requirements and the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting 

for a discussion of the potential impact that the implementation of asc 606 is expected to have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures see note b summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k 

we face significant competition which may reduce our profits and limit or reduce our market share 

the market for product development solutions and iot solutions is rapidly changing and characterized by vigorous competition both by entry of competitors with innovative technologies and by consolidation of companies with complementary products and technologies this competition could result in price reductions for our products and services reduced margins loss of customers and loss of market share our primary competition comes from 

 in addition barriers to entry into certain segments of the software industry have declined and the ability of customers to adopt software solutions has increased with the ability to offer software in the cloud and the increasing prevalence of subscription license models and customer acceptance of both those models because of these and other factors competitive conditions in the industry are likely to intensify in the future 

increased competition could result in price reductions reduced revenue and profit margin and loss of market share any of which would likely harm our business 

a breach of security in our products or computer systems or those of our thirdparty service providers could compromise the integrity of our products harm our reputation create additional liability and adversely impact our financial results 

we have implemented and continue to implement measures intended to maintain the security and integrity of our products source code and computer systems the potential consequences of a security breach or system disruption particularly through cyberattack or cyberintrusion including by computer hackers foreign governments and cyber terrorists have increased in scope as the number intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased despite efforts to create security barriers to such threats it is impossible for us to eliminate this risk and in fact we deal with security issues on a regular basis and have experienced security incidents from time to time accordingly there is a risk that we might encounter a material event or issue and that such an event or issue may occur in addition we offer cloud services to our customers and some of our products are hosted by thirdparty service providers which expose us to additional risks as those repositories of our customers’ proprietary data may be targeted by such hackers a significant breach of the security andor integrity of our products or systems or those of our thirdparty service providers could prevent our products from functioning properly could enable access to sensitive proprietary or confidential information including that of our customers or could disrupt our business operations or those of our customers this could require us to incur significant costs of investigation remediation harm our reputation cause customers to stop buying our products and cause us to face lawsuits and potential liability which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

we may be unable to hire or retain personnel with the technical skills necessary to further develop our software products which could adversely affect our ability to compete 

our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical personnel to develop our products competition for such personnel in our industry is intense especially for personnel with augmented and virtual reality and analytics expertise as there are comparatively fewer persons with those skills if we are unable to attract and retain technical personnel with the requisite skills our product development efforts could be delayed which could adversely affect our ability to compete and thereby adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

our sales and operations are globally dispersed which exposes us to additional compliance risks which could adversely affect our business and financial results 

we sell and deliver software and services and maintain support operations in a large number of countries whose laws and practices differ from one another and are subject to unexpected changes managing these geographically dispersed operations requires significant attention and resources to ensure compliance with laws of those countries and those of the us governing our activities in nonus countries 

those laws include but are not limited to anticorruption laws and regulations including the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and the uk bribery act 2010 data privacy laws and regulations including the european unions general data privacy regulation and trade and economic sanctions laws and regulations including laws administered by the us department of the treasury’s office of foreign assets control the us state department the us department of commerce the united nations security council and other relevant sanctions authorities the fcpa and uk bribery act prohibit us and business partners or agents acting on our behalf from offering or providing anything of value to persons considered to be foreign officials under those laws for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business the uk bribery act also prohibits commercial bribery and accepting bribes our compliance risks with these laws are heightened due to the global nature of our business our gotomarket approach for our iot business that relies heavily on expanding our partner ecosystem the fact that we operate in and are expanding into countries with a higher incidence of corruption and fraudulent business practices than others the fact that we deal with governments and stateowned business enterprises the employees and representatives of which may be considered foreign officials for purposes of the fcpa and the uk bribery act and the fact global enforcement of anticorruption laws data privacy laws and other laws has significantly increased 

accordingly while we strive to maintain a comprehensive compliance program we cannot guarantee that an employee agent or business partner will not act in violation of our policies or us or other applicable laws or that we may inadvertently violate such laws investigations of alleged violations of those laws can be expensive and disruptive violations of such laws can lead to civil andor criminal prosecutions substantial fines and other sanctions including the revocation of our rights to continue certain operations and also cause business and reputation loss which could adversely affect our financial results andor stock price 

our international businesses present economic and operating risks which could adversely affect our business and financial results 

we expect that our international operations will continue to expand and to account for a significant portion of our total revenue because we transact business in various foreign currencies the volatility of foreign exchange rates has had and may in the future have a material adverse effect on our revenue expenses and operating results 

other risks inherent in our international operations include but are not limited to the following 



our inability to maintain or develop our strategic and technology relationships could adversely affect our business 

we have many strategic and technology relationships with other companies with which we work to offer complementary solutions and services that market and sell our solutions and that provide technologies that we embed in our solutions we may not realize the expected benefits from these relationships and such relationships may be terminated by the other party if these companies fail to perform or if a company terminates or substantially alters the terms of the relationship we could suffer delays in product development reduced sales or other operational difficulties and our business results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights which could adversely affect our business and our ability to compete effectively 

our software products are proprietary we protect our intellectual property rights in these items by relying on copyrights trademarks patents and common law safeguards including trade secret protection as well as restrictions on disclosures and transferability contained in our agreements with other parties despite these measures the laws of all relevant jurisdictions may not afford adequate protection to our products and other intellectual property in addition we frequently encounter attempts by individuals and companies to pirate our software if our measures to protect our intellectual property rights fail others may be able to use those rights which could reduce our competitiveness and revenues 

in addition any legal action to protect our intellectual property rights that we may bring or be engaged in could be costly may distract management from daytoday operations and may lead to additional claims against us and we may not succeed all of which would materially adversely affect our operating results 

intellectual property infringement claims could be asserted against us which could be expensive to defend and could result in limitations on our use of the claimed intellectual property 

the software industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding copyright patent and other intellectual property rights as well as improper disclosure of confidential or proprietary information if a lawsuit of this type is filed it could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel we cannot be sure that we would prevail against any such asserted claims if we did not prevail we could be prevented from using the claimed intellectual property or be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements which might not be available on terms acceptable to us in addition to possible claims with respect to our proprietary products some of our products contain technology developed by and licensed from third parties and we may likewise be susceptible to infringement claims with respect to these thirdparty technologies 

businesses we acquire may not generate the revenue and earnings we anticipate and may otherwise adversely affect our business 

we have acquired and intend to continue to acquire new businesses and technologies if we fail to successfully integrate and manage the businesses and technologies we acquire or if an acquisition does not further our business strategy as we expect our operating results will be adversely affected 

moreover business combinations involve a number of risks and uncertainties that can adversely affect our operations and operating results including 



 our financial condition could be adversely affected if significant errors or defects are found in our software 

sophisticated software can sometimes contain errors defects security vulnerabilities or other performance problems if such items are discovered in our products we may need to expend significant financial technical and management resources or divert some of our development resources in order to resolve or work around those items and we may not be able to correct them in a timely manner or provide an adequate response to our customers 

errors defects security vulnerabilities or other performance problems in our products could also cause us to lose revenue lose customers and lose market share and could subject us to liability such items could also damage our business reputation and cause us to lose new business opportunities 

we may have exposure to additional tax liabilities and our effective tax rate may increase or fluctuate which could increase our income tax expense and reduce our net income 

as a multinational organization we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes in the us and in various foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision and other tax liabilities in the ordinary course of a global business there are many intercompany transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain our tax returns are subject to review by various taxing authorities although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes could be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 

our effective tax rate can be adversely affected by several factors many of which are outside of our control including 

 on september 7 2017 we entered into a lease for a new worldwide headquarters in the boston seaport district beginning in january 2019 because our current headquarters lease will not expire until november 2022 we are seeking to exit our current headquarters lease or sublease that space but have not yet done so if we are unable to do so or unable to do so for an amount at least equal to our rent obligations under the current headquarters lease we will bear overlapping rent obligations for those premises and will be required to record a charge related to any rent shortfall which could adversely affect our financial condition 

under our current headquarters lease we pay approximately 74 million in annual base rent plus operating expenses together rent obligations an aggregate annual total of approximately 120 million we will begin paying rent under our new headquarters lease on july 1 2020 our rent under the new lease when we begin paying rent will be an annual base rent amount of 113 million plus our pro rata portions of building operating expenses and real estate taxes approximately 63 of such amounts estimated to be approximately 71 million in 2020 the base rent will increase by 03 million 

each year over the term of the lease accordingly we will be required to pay rent for both locations from july 1 2020 until november 30 2022 unless we can successfully negotiate an exit to our current lease or sublease our current premises we may be unable to negotiate a financially desirable termination of our current lease or to sublease our current premises for an amount at least equal to our rent obligations under the current lease which would require us to bear the overlapping rent obligations and to record a charge related to such shortfall and could adversely affect our cash flow and financial condition a charge for such shortfall will be recorded in the earlier of the period that we cease using the existing space which will likely occur in the second quarter of our fiscal 2019 or the period we exit the lease contract 

ii other considerations 

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations as well as our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt 

we have a significant amount of indebtedness as of november 15 2018 our total debt outstanding was approximately 728 million approximately 228 million of which was under our 700 million secured credit facility which matures in september 2023 and 500 million of which was associated with the 6 senior notes issued may 2016 which mature in may 2024 and are unsecured see  liquidity and capital resourcesoutstanding notes  in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this annual report all amounts outstanding under the credit facility and the notes will be due and payable in full on their respective maturity dates as of november 15 2018 we had unused commitments under our credit facility of approximately 472 million ptc inc the parent company and one of our foreign subsidiaries are eligible borrowers under the credit facility and certain other foreign subsidiaries may become borrowers under our credit facility in the future subject to certain conditions 

notwithstanding the limits contained in the credit agreement governing our credit facility and the indenture governing our 2024 6 notes we may be able to incur substantial additional debt from time to time to finance working capital capital expenditures investments or acquisitions or for other purposes if we do so the risks related to our high level of debt could intensify specifically our high level of debt could 

 any of the abovelisted factors could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt agreements 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness which may not be successful 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business legislative regulatory and other factors some of which are beyond our control we may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness 

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness we may not be able to effect any such alternative measures if necessary on commercially reasonable terms or at all and even if successful those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations our debt agreements restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due 

our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all would materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations and our ability to satisfy our debt obligations 

if we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt we will be in default and the lenders under our credit facility could terminate their commitments to loan money the lenders could foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings the holders of our 2024 6 notes could declare all outstanding principal premium if any and interest to be due and payable and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation all of these events could result in a loss of your investment 

we are required to comply with certain financial and operating covenants under our debt agreements any failure to comply with those covenants could cause amounts borrowed to become immediately due and payable andor prevent us from borrowing under the credit facility 

we are required to comply with specified financial and operating covenants under our debt agreements and to make payments under our debt which limit our ability to operate our business as we otherwise might operate it our failure to comply with any of these covenants or to meet any debt payment obligations could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived would result in any amounts outstanding including any accrued interest andor unpaid fees becoming immediately due and payable we might not have sufficient working capital or liquidity to satisfy any repayment obligations in the event of an acceleration of those obligations in addition if we are not in compliance with the financial and operating covenants under the credit facility at the time we wish to borrow funds we will be unable to borrow funds 

in addition the financial and operating covenants under the credit facility may limit our ability to borrow funds including for strategic acquisitions and share repurchases 

we may be unable to meet our goal of returning 40 of free cash flow to shareholders through share repurchases which could decrease your expected return on investment in ptc stock 

our capital allocation strategy includes a longterm goal of returning approximately 40 of free cash flow cash flow from operations less capital expenditures to shareholders through share repurchases meeting this goal requires us to generate consistent free cash flow and have available capital in the years ahead in an amount sufficient to enable us to continue investing in organic and inorganic growth as well as to return a significant portion of the cash generated to stockholders in the form of share repurchases we may not meet this goal if we do not generate the free cash flow we expect if we use our available cash to satisfy other priorities if we have insufficient funds available to make such repurchases or if we are unable to borrow funds under our credit facility to make such repurchases 

additionally our cash flow fluctuates over the course of the year and over multiple years so although our goal is to return 40 of free cash flow to shareholders that is an average over a longer term and the number of shares repurchased and amount of free cash flow returned in any given period will vary and may be more or less than 40 in any such period finally the number of shares repurchased for a given amount of cash will vary based on ptc’s stock price so the number of shares repurchased will not be a consistent or predictable number or percentage of outstanding stock 

our stock price has been volatile which may make it harder to resell shares at a favorable time and price 

market prices for securities of software companies are generally volatile and are subject to significant fluctuations that may be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies the trading prices and valuations of these stocks and of ours may not be predictable negative changes in the public’s perception of the prospects of software companies or of ptc or the markets we serve could depress our stock price regardless of our operating results 

also a large percentage of our common stock is held by institutional investors and by rockwell automation purchases and sales of our common stock by these investors could have a significant impact on the market price of the stock for more information about those investors please see our proxy statement with respect to our most recent annual meeting of stockholders and schedules 13d and 13g filed with the sec with respect to our common stock 

our 2024 6 notes are not listed on any national securities exchange or included in any automated quotation system which could make it harder to resell the notes at a favorable time and price 

our 2024 6 notes are not listed on any national securities exchange or included in any automated quotation system as a result an active market for the notes may not exist or be maintained which would adversely affect the market price and liquidity of the notes in that case holders may not be able to sell their notes at a particular time or at a favorable price 

the market for noninvestment grade debt historically has been subject to severe disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the notes the market if any for the notes may experience similar disruptions and any such disruptions may adversely affect the liquidity in that market or the prices at which the notes may be sold

revenue sources and recognition 

we sell subscription and perpetual licenses to our software support for perpetual licenses cloud services and professional services 

subscription revenue is comprised of timebased licenses whereby customers use our software and receive related support for a specified term and for which through 2018 revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the contract perpetual licenses are a perpetual right to use the software for which revenue is generally recognized up front upon shipment to the customer support revenue is comprised 

of contracts to maintain new andor previously purchased perpetual licenses for which revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the contract our subscription revenue includes an immaterial amount of software as a service saas and cloud services for which revenue is generally recognized ratably over the term of the contract consulting and training professional services engagements typically result from sales of new licenses and for which revenue is recognized over the term of the engagement our revenue recognition practices are described below in “ critical accounting policies and estimates ” and in note b   summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report 

beginning with 2019 we will recognize revenue under the accounting standards update no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 asc 606 revenue recognition standard which differs significantly from the previous accounting rules under asc 606 all performance obligations under the product that can be separately identified are and revenue is recognized for each performance obligation accordingly our onpremise subscription contracts will be unbundled into multiple performance obligations ie license cloud and support the license portion of such subscription contracts approximately 50 to 55 will be recognized upfront and the cloud and support portions approximately 45 to 50 of such subscription contracts will be recognized ratably over the term the effects of our adoption of asc 606 including expected adjustments to retained earnings related to billed and unbilled deferred revenue are described below in “ recent accounting pronouncements ” and in note b   summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report 

executive overview 

our revenue results for the year reflect the adoption of subscription licensing by our customers and the compounding effect of the subscription business model as subscription revenue recurs and new subscription revenue is added in the year subscription revenue software revenue and total revenue were all up over fiscal 2017 despite an 800 basis point increase in subscription mix year over year recurring software revenue represented approximately 90 of our software revenue in 2018 up from 86 a year ago our revenue results also drove our operating margin improvements for the year despite increases in sales and marketing and research and development expenses operating margins and eps were up over the prior year 

our cad and plm businesses performed well in the year our iot business continued to grow as we added new customers and existing customers expanded their implementations and interest in our augmented reality solutions increased we made important strides in extending our market reach and further differentiating our technology with strategic relationships we entered into in 2018 including those with rockwell automation microsoft and ansys 

  



the increase in total revenue subscription revenue and eps reflects our transformation into a subscription software company as our mix of subscription sales relative to perpetual license sales has increased perpetual license revenue and support revenue have declined 

our 2018 revenue results include the impact of a settlement of a customer dispute concerning a professional services receivable the settlement reached in september 2018 included partial payment of the receivable and new software purchases the net revenue writedown recorded in the fourth quarter of 2018 was 93 million comprised of a 145 million services revenue writedown partially offset by subscription revenue of 52 million additionally professional services revenue has declined in accordance with our strategy to migrate more services engagements to our partners and to deliver products that require less consulting and training services 

  

the increase in subscription revenue relative to perpetual license revenue has resulted in an increase in our recurring software revenue with approximately 90 of our software revenue and 79 of our total revenue in 2018 from recurring software revenue streams compared to 86 and 73 in 2017 and 82 and 68 in 2016 



gaap and nongaap operating income in 2018 reflect maturity of our subscription program an increase in gross margin is associated with higher subscription revenue and a lower mix of professional services revenue which has lower margins than our software revenue the increase in gross margins was partially offset by higher sales and marketing and research and development costs 

our gaap and nongaap earnings reflect a combination of revenue growth due to the strength of our subscription model and strong new bookings as well as continued cost and expense discipline   

we ended 2018 with cash cash equivalents and marketable securities of 316 million down from 330 million at the end of 2017 we generated 248 million  of cash from operations in 2018 compared to 135 million in 2017 in the fourth quarter of 2018 rockwell automation made a 1 billion equity investment in ptc as part of a strategic partnership using the cash proceeds from this investment ptc entered into a 1000 million accelerated share repurchase we also used cash from operations to repurchase another 100 million of common stock and to repay a net 70 million  of borrowings under our credit facility in 2018 at september 30 2018 the balance outstanding under our credit facility was 148 million and total debt outstanding was 648 million 

operating measures 

we provide these measures to help investors understand the progress of our subscription transition these measures are not necessarily indicative of revenue for the period or any future period 

license and subscription bookings 

  

license and subscription bookings for 2018 were 466 million up 11 over 2017 up 9 on a constant currency basis and up 16 over 2016 over the past two years cad core plm and iot have delivered bookings cagrs at the high end of market growth rates as cad and plm customers have converted existing license contracts to subscriptions and customers have adopted and expanded iot implementations 

subscription acv 

s ubscription acv increased 24 over 2017 to 177 million due to continued adoption of our subscription offerings around the globe 

annualized recurring revenue arr 

arr   was approximat ely 1012 m illion as of the fourth quarter of 2018 an increase of 12 compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 and the seventh consecutive quarter of doubledigit yearoveryear growth 

deferred revenue and backlog unbilled deferred revenue 

deferred revenue primarily relates to software agreements invoiced to customers for which the revenue has not yet been recognized unbilled deferred revenue backlog is the aggregate of booked orders for license support and subscription including multiyear subscription contracts with start dates after october 1 2018 that are subject to a limited annual cancellation right of which approximately 50 million was cancellable at september 30 2018 for which the associated revenue has not been recognized and the customer has not yet been invoiced we do not record unbilled deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheets such amounts are recorded as deferred revenue when we invoice the customer we provide this view of deferred revenue and backlog to enable investors to understand the significant contractual commitments we have to customers and to provide a view of future revenue that we expect will be recognized even if those commitments are not reflected on our balance sheet 

  



of the unbilled deferred revenue balance at september 30 2018 we expect to invoice customers approximately 560 million within the next twelve months unbilled deferred revenue grew 44 year over year due to the high volume of new subscription bookings many of our subscription bookings are for multiple years and are typically billed annually at the start of each annual subscription period the average contract duration was approximately 2 years for new subscription contracts in 2018 and 2017 

we expect that the amount of deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue will fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to the specific timing duration and size of customer subscription and support agreements varying billing cycles of such agreements the specific timing of customer renewals foreign currency fluctuations the timing of when deferred revenue is recognized as revenue and the timing of our fiscal quarter ends 

the effects of our adoption of asc 606 including expected adjustments to retained earnings related to billed and unbilled deferred revenue are described below in “ recent accounting pronouncements ” and in note b   summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

future expectations strategies and risks   

our transition to a subscription model has been a headwind for revenue and earnings in 2018 with an increase in our subscription mix of 800 basis points as compared to fiscal 2017 we expect a further increase in our subscription mix of 1100 to 1300 basis points which will result in a further headwind for revenue and earnings in fiscal 2019 we expect the effect of the transition to moderate in fiscal 2020 a higher mix of subscription bookings is expected to benefit us over the long term but results in lower revenue and lower earnings in the near term we expect that iot and ar adoption rates will continue to expand and will be the most significant driver to growth 

with the growth opportunity in industrial internet of things and augmented reality and other strategic initiatives we’ve undertaken as well as our continued commitment to operating margin improvement we are realigning our workforce in the beginning of 2019 to shift investment to support these strategic high growth opportunities this realignment will result in a restructuring charge of approximately 18 million in 2019 which consists principally of termination benefits substantially all of which we expect will be paid in 2019 as this is a realignment of resources rather than a costsavings initiative we don’t expect this realignment will result in significant cost savings and the effect of the realignment is reflected in our 2019 guidance 

in 2019 we will be moving into a new worldwide headquarters in the boston seaport district and we will be vacating our current headquarters space because our current headquarters lease will not expire until november 2022 we are seeking to sublease that space but have not yet done so if we are unable to sublease our current headquarters space for an amount at least equal to our rent obligations under the current headquarters lease we will bear overlapping rent obligations for those premises and will be required to record a charge related to such rent shortfall we currently pay approximately 12 million in annual base rent and operating expenses for our current headquarters we expect to record a charge for any such shortfall in the earlier of the period that we cease using the space which will likely occur in the second quarter of our fiscal 2019 or the period we sign sublease contracts additionally we will incur other costs associated with the move which will be recorded as incurred 

  we are adopting the new revenue recognition standard asc 606 effective october 1 2018 asc 606 will among other things materially impact the timing of our revenue recognition refer to note b   summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for additional information about the impact of adopting this guidance 

our results have been impacted and we expect will continue to be impacted by our ability to close large transactions the amount of bookings and revenue particularly license and subscriptions attributable to large transactions and the number of such transactions may vary significantly from quarter to quarter based on customer purchasing decisions and macroeconomic conditions such transactions may have long lead times as they often follow a lengthy product selection and evaluation process and for existing customers are influenced by contract expiration cycles this may cause volatility in our results

 impact of foreign currency exchange on results of operations 

approximately two thirds of our revenue and half of our expenses are transacted in currencies other than the us dollar currency translation affects our reported results which are in us dollars if actual reported results were converted into us dollars based on the corresponding prior year’s foreign currency exchange rates 2018 and 2017 revenue would have been lower by 32 million and higher by 1 million respectively and expenses would have been lower by 20 million and higher by 3 million respectively the net impact on yearoveryear results would have been a decrease in operating income of 12 million in 2018 and a decrease in operating income of 2 million in 2017 the results of operations revenue by line of business and revenue by geographic region in the tables that follow present both actual percentage changes year over year and percentage changes on a constant currency basis 

revenue 

revenue is reported below by line of business subscription support perpetual license and professional services by product area solutions and iot and by geographic region americas europe asia pacific results include combined revenue from direct sales and our channel 

revenue by line of business 

software 

as our mix of subscription sales relative to perpetual license sales has increased perpetual license revenue and support revenue have declined and are expected to continue to decline as customers purchase our solutions as subscriptions and convert existing perpetual licenses with support contracts to subscriptions as our subscription business matures recurring software revenue growth is expected to continue due to the compounding benefit of a subscription business model 

professional services 

professional services revenue was down 13 16 constant currency in 2018 compared to 2017 professional services revenue in 2018 reflects a 145 million writedown related to a settlement of a customer dispute concerning a receivable these results are in line with our expectation that professional services revenue will trend flattodown over time due to our strategy to expand margins by migrating 

more services engagements to our partners and delivering products that require less consulting and training services 

revenue by product 



solutions 

 software revenue grew 8 in 2018 compared to 2017 as a result of strong cad plm and global channel license and subscription bookings over the past several years offset by a significant increase in the subscription mix in the current period subscription sales have increased in part due to our support conversion programs that we have been offering over the past few years whereby customers may convert existing perpetual licenses and support to a new subscription recurring software revenue grew 12 in 2018 over 2017 and has grown doubledigits for seven consecutive quarters as our transition matures recurring software revenue growth is expected to continue due to the compounding benefit of a subscription business model 

professional services revenue in 2018 includes a 145 million writedown related to a settlement of a previously disclosed customer dispute concerning a receivable in addition professional services revenue in 2018 declined compared to 2017 due to our strategy to limit the amount of professional services we provide 

iot 

software revenue in 2018 increased by 32 compared to 2017 due to increases in license and subscription bookings over the past several years offset by an 800 basis points increase in the subscription mix recurring software revenue grew 42 in 2018 over 2017 due to strong iot bookings growth over the past several years software revenue includes 52 million of new subscription revenue related to the settlement of a customer dispute concerning a professional services receivable which settlement included new subscription purchases 

professional services revenue increased in 2018 compared to 2017 in part due to implementation and adoption services we provide to our iot customers as part of our efforts to help their iot initiatives be successful

americas 

americas software revenue has benefited from strong license and subscription bookings growth over the past two years 10 cagr new license and subscriptions bookings were up 20 in 2018 compared to 2017 despite an 800 basis point increase in the subscription mix 

europe 

europe constant currency yearoveryear revenue growth reflects solid bookings growth over the past two years 8 cagr the increase in revenue in europe in 2018 compared to 2017 was due to the strong bookings in 2017 when this region delivered 28 constant currency growth in bookings bookings in europe declined 10 in 2018 compared to 2017 and were adversely affected in 2018 due to a 7 million deal which closed early in the fourth quarter of 2017 instead of the first quarter of 2018 

yearoveryear changes in foreign currency exchange rates particularly the euro impacted european revenue favorably in 2018 by 282 million and unfavorably by 39 million in 2017

yearoveryear changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted revenue by 42 million and 16 million in 2018 and 2017 respectively 

gross margin 



the increase in total gross margin in 2018 compared to 2017 is due to total revenue growth and lower costs of professional services total revenue in 2018 grew 7 over 2017 margins for license and subscription are beginning to expand as the subscription model matures and revenue that has been deferred begins to contribute to current periods support gross margins are down for 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to the 14 decrease in support revenue associated with an increase in our subscription mix and the conversion of existing customers from support contracts to subscription support revenue comprised 40  of our total revenue in 2018 compared to 50 in 2017 and 57  in 2016 professional services gross margin is down due to the 145 million revenue writedown related to a settlement of a customer dispute concerning a receivable without this revenue writedown professional services gross margin would have been 15 

costs and expenses 

  

 

2018 compared to 2017 

costs and expenses in 2018 compared to 2017 increased primarily as a result of the following 

          the increases above were partially offset by 

 

2017 compared to 2016 

costs and expenses in 2017 compared to 2016 decreased primarily as a result of the following 



 the decreases above were partially offset by increases due to 

 cost of license and subscription revenue 



our cost of license and subscription includes cost of license which consists of fixed and variable costs associated with reproducing and distributing software and documentation as well as royalties paid to third parties for technology embedded in or licensed with our software products and amortization of intangible assets associated with acquired products and cost of subscription which includes our cost of cloud services and software as a service revenue including hosting fees costs associated with providing postcontract support such as providing software updates and technical support for both our subscription offerings and our perpetual licenses are included in cost of support revenue cost of license and subscription revenue as a percent of license and subscription revenue can vary depending on the subscription mix percentage the product mix sold the effect of fixed and variable royalties headcount and the level of amortization of acquired software intangible assets 

costs in 2018 compared to 2017 increased primarily as a result of a 37 million increase in cloud services hosting costs and a 25 million increase in total compensation benefit and travel expense due to increases in salaries 

costs in 2017 compared to 2016 increased primarily as a result of a 150 million increase in total compensation benefit and travel expense due to increased headcount primarily associated with supporting our cloud products and a 34 million increase in cloud services hosting costs 

cost of support revenue 



cost of support revenue consists of costs such as salaries benefits and computer equipment and facilities associated with customer support and the release of support updates including related royalty costs associated with providing support for both our perpetual licenses and subscription licenses 

costs and expense in 2018 compared to 2017 decreased primarily due to a decrease in headcount resulting in 3 19 million lower total compensation benefit and travel costs 

costs and expense in 2017 compared to 2016 increased primarily due to a 5 31 million increase in total compensation benefit and travel costs 

cost of professional services revenue 



our cost of professional services revenue includes costs such as salaries benefits information technology costs and facilities expenses for our training and consulting personnel and thirdparty subcontractor fees 

in 2018 compared to 2017 total compensation benefit and travel expenses were decreased by 68 million primarily due to an 8 decrease in headcount 

in 2017 compared to 2016 total compensation benefit costs and travel expenses decreased by 188 million the cost of thirdparty consulting services was 47 million lower in 2017 compared to 2016 

as a result of decreases in professional services revenue in 2018 2017 and 2016 we have reduced headcount resulting in lower compensationrelated costs this is in line with our strategy to have our strategic services partners perform services for customers directly which has decreased revenue and costs and improved services margins 

sales and marketing 

our sales and marketing expenses primarily include salaries and benefits sales commissions advertising and marketing programs travel information technology costs and facility expenses 

costs and expense in 2018 compared to 2017 increased primarily due to a 386 million increase in total compensation benefit costs and travel expenses as a result of increases in headcount salary increases higher commissions costs and higher stockbased compensation 

in 2017 compared to 2016 event costs increased 31 million due to our liveworx event held in may 2017 our compensation benefits and travel costs were 35 million lower in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to lower commissions which were higher in 2016 as a result of significantly higher than planned subscription bookings 

research and development 

our research and development expenses consist principally of salaries and benefits information technology costs and facility expenses major research and development activities include developing new releases and updates of our software that enhance functionality and add features 

in 2018 compared to 2017 total compensation benefit and travel expenses were higher by 6 120 million due to an increase in headcount and salary increases 

in 2017 compared to 2016 total compensation benefit and travel expenses were higher by 3 50 million due to an increase in headcount and a 16 million increase in cloud services hosting costs as some product testing has moved to a cloud environment 

general and administrative ga 



our ga expenses include the costs of our corporate finance information technology human resources legal and administrative functions as well as acquisitionrelated and other transactional charges bad debt expense and outside professional services including accounting and legal fees acquisitionrelated costs include direct costs of acquisitions and expenses related to acquisition integration activities including transaction fees due diligence costs retention bonuses and severance and professional fees including legal and accounting costs related to the acquisition in addition subsequent adjustments to our initial estimated amount of contingent consideration associated with specific acquisitions are included in acquisitionrelated charges other transactional charges include thirdparty costs related to structuring unusual transactions 

in 2018 compared to 2017 the cost of professional fees decreased 33 million offset by an increase of 21 million in compensation due to headcount and merit increases 

in 2017 compared to 2016 total compensation benefit and travel costs increased by 70 million primarily because of merit increases and increased severance costs as well as higher stockbased compensation due to a higher attainment of performancebased awards an award modification and the launch of the employee stock purchase plan espp in the fourth quarter of 2016 offsetting the increases acquisitionrelated charges decreased 49 million because there were no significant acquisitions in the year and tax and audit fees decreased 18 million during the year 

amortization of acquired intangible assets 



amortization of acquired intangible assets reflects the amortization of acquired nonproduct related intangible assets primarily customer and trademarkrelated intangible assets recorded in connection 

with completed acquisitions amortization of intangible assets typically follows the economic benefit pattern of the acquired intangible assets 

the decrease in amortization of acquired intangible assets from 2016 to 2017 and from 2017 to 2018 is due to certain intangibles becoming fully amortized as well as the impact of foreign currency exchanges 

restructuring and other charges net 



in fiscal 2016 we committed to a plan to restructure our global workforce and consolidate select facilities to reduce our cost structure and to realign our investments with our identified growth opportunities the restructuring was substantially completed in 2017 and resulted in a total restructuring charge of 845 million 

 in 2018 we recorded restructuring credits of 10 million related to prior year restructuring actions and made cash payments related to restructuring charges of 28 million at september 30 2018 accrued restructuring totaled 24 million of which we expect to pay 15 million within the next twelve months 

restructuring charges for 2017 were 79 million including 56 million of facility related charges and 24 million of employee terminationrelated costs in 2017 we made cash payments related to restructuring charges of 371 million 

headquarters relocation charges represent accelerated depreciation expense recorded in anticipation of our relocation to a new worldwide headquarters in the boston seaport district in 2019 and exiting our current headquarters facility because our current headquarters lease will not expire until november 2022 we are seeking to sublease that space but have not yet done so if we are unable to sublease our current headquarters space for an amount at least equal to our rent obligations under the current headquarters lease approximately 12 million per year we will bear overlapping rent obligations for those premises and will be required to record additional headquarters relocation charges related to any rent shortfall a charge for such shortfall will be recorded in the earlier of the period that we cease using the existing space which will likely occur in the second quarter of our fiscal 2019 or the period we sign sublease contracts additionally we will incur other costs associated with the move which will be recorded as incurred 

interest expense 

the decrease in interest expense in 2018 compared to 2017 is primarily due to the writeoff deferred financing fees of 12 million in march 2017 when we modified our credit facility and reduced the loan commitment to 600 million from 900 million offset by an increase in interest expense of 04 million 

the increase in interest expense in 2017 compared to 2016 was due to a full year of interest being incurred on the 500 million 6 senior notes the 2024 6 notes which were issued in the third quarter of 2016 and higher average interest rates on our revolving credit facility in 2017 compared to 2016 

the average interest rate on our total borrowings was 52  in 2018 49  in 2017 and 30  in 2016 

interest income and other expense net 



foreign currency net losses include costs of hedging contracts certain realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains or losses and foreign exchange gains or losses resulting from the required periodend currency remeasurement of the assets and liabilities of our subsidiaries that use the us dollar as their functional currency because a large portion of our revenue and expenses is transacted in foreign currencies we engage in hedging transactions involving the use of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates changes in the balance year over year are due to required periodend currency remeasurement of the assets and liabilities of our subsidiaries that use the us dollar as their functional currency hedging costs increased 20 million in 2018 compared to 2017 and 13 million in 2017 compared to 2016 

interest income represents earnings on the investment of our available cash balances 

other income expense net is primarily made up other nonoperating gains and losses in january 2017 we sold a cost method investment for a gain of 37 million 

income taxes 

tax provision and effective income tax rate 



on december 22 2017 the united states enacted tax reform legislation through the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act which significantly changed existing us tax laws by a reduction of the corporate tax rate the implementation of a new system of taxation for nonus earnings the imposition of a onetime tax on the deemed repatriation of undistributed earnings of nonus subsidiaries and by the expansion of the limitations on the deductibility of executive compensation and interest expense as we have a september 30 fiscal yearend a blended us statutory federal rate of approximately 245 applies for our fiscal year ending september 30 2018 and 21 for subsequent fiscal years the tax act also provides that net operating losses generated in years ending after december 31 2017 our fiscal 2018 will be carried forward indefinitely and can no longer be carried back and that net operating losses generated in years beginning after december 31 2017 can only reduce taxable income by up to 80 when utilized in a future period 

we have provided no federal income taxes payable as a result of the deemed repatriation of undistributed earnings as the tax will be offset by a combination of current year losses and existing attributes which had a full valuation allowance recorded against the related deferred tax assets we recorded a state income taxes payable on the deemed repatriation of 21 million we also recorded a deferred tax benefit of 141 million for the impact of the tax act on our net us deferred income tax balances this was primarily attributable to the reduction of the federal tax rate on the net deferred tax liability in the us and the ability to realize net operating losses from the reversal of existing deferred tax assets which can now be carried forward indefinitely and can therefore be netted against deferred tax liabilities for indefinite lived intangible assets 

the changes included in the tax act are broad and complex the securities exchange commission has issued rules that allow for a measurement period of up to one year after the enactment date of the 

tax act to finalize the recording of the related tax impacts we have finalized our accounting for the effects of the legislation with the exception of any additional guidance that may impact our provisional amounts recorded for the transition tax we are not able to make reasonable estimates at this time of the effects of certain provisions of the tax act that will apply to us beginning in our fiscal year ending september 30 2019 including the global intangible low tax income tax the gilti tax and any associated impact on our us valuation allowance we currently anticipate finalizing and recording any resulting adjustments in the quarter ending december 29 2018 

  

in 2018 our effective tax rate was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due to us tax reform as described above in 2018 2017 and 2016 our effective tax rate was materially impacted by our corporate structure in which our foreign taxes are at an effective tax rate lower than the us a significant amount of our foreign earnings is generated by our subsidiaries organized in ireland in 2018 2017 and 2016 the foreign rate differential predominantly relates to these irish earnings additionally we have a full valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in the us primarily related to net operating loss tax credit carryforwards capitalized research and development expense and deferred revenue as a result we have not recorded a benefit related to ongoing us losses our foreign rate differential in 2018 2017 and 2016 includes the continuing rate benefit from a business realignment completed on september 30 2014 in which intellectual property was transferred between two whollyowned foreign subsidiaries the realignment allows us to more efficiently manage the distribution of our products to european customers in 2018 this realignment resulted in a tax benefit of approximately 24 million  and in 2017 and 2016 a benefit of approximately 28 million  in each year in 2017 and 2016 the change in valuation allowance primarily relates to us losses not benefited partially offset by the release of valuation allowances in foreign subsidiaries of 90 million  and 31 million  respectively we recorded foreign withholding taxes an obligation of the us parent of 27 million  in 2018 and 20 million  in 2017 and 2016 respectively 

valuation allowance 

we have concluded based on the weight of available evidence that a full valuation allowance continues to be required against our us net deferred tax assets as they are not more likely than not to be realized in the future we will continue to reassess our valuation allowance requirements each financial reporting period 

tax audits and examinations 

in the normal course of business ptc and its subsidiaries are examined by various taxing authorities including the internal revenue service irs in the u s we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate we are currently under audit by tax authorities in several jurisdictions audits by tax authorities typically involve examination of the deductibility of certain permanent items transfer pricing limitations on net operating losses and tax credits although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in material changes in our estimates 

in the fourth quarter of 2016 we received an assessment of approximately 12 million  from the tax authorities in korea the assessment relates to various tax issues primarily foreign withholding taxes we have appealed and intend to vigorously defend our positions we believe that upon completion of a multilevel appeal process it is more likely than not that our positions will be sustained accordingly we have not recorded a tax reserve for this matter we paid this assessment in the first quarter of 2017 pending resolution of the appeal process 

our future effective income tax rate 

our future effective income tax rate may be materially impacted by the amount of income taxes associated with our foreign earnings which are taxed at rates different from the us federal statutory income tax rate as well as the timing and extent of the realization of deferred tax assets and changes in the tax law further our tax rate may fluctuate within a fiscal year including from quarter to quarter due to items arising from discrete events including settlements of tax audits and assessments the resolution or identification of tax position uncertainties and acquisitions of other companies 

operating measures 

subscription bookings and subscription acv 

given the difference in revenue recognition between the sale of a perpetual software license revenue is recognized at the time of sale and a subscription revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription term we use bookings for internal planning forecasting and reporting of new license and subscription sales and cloud services transactions 

in order to normalize between perpetual and subscription licenses we define subscription bookings  as the subscription annualized contract value subscription acv of new subscription bookings multiplied by a conversion factor of 2 we arrived at the conversion factor of 2 by considering many variables including pricing support length of term and renewal rates in 2018 and 2017 the average subscription contract term was approximately two years 

we define subscription acv  as the total value of a new subscription booking divided by the term of the contract in days multiplied by 365 if the term of the subscription contract is less than a year and is not associated with an existing contract the acv is equal to the total contract value beginning in the third quarter of 2018 minimum acv commitments under our strategic alliance agreement with rockwell automation are included in subscription acv if the periodtodate minimum acv commitment exceeds actual acv sold under the agreement 

we define license and subscription bookings  as subscription bookings plus perpetual license bookings plus any monthly software rental bookings during the period 

because subscription bookings is a metric we use to approximate the value of subscription sales if sold as perpetual licenses it does not represent the actual revenue that will be recognized with respect to subscription sales or that would be recognized if the sales had been perpetual licenses 

annualized recurring revenue arr 

annualized recurring revenue arr for a given quarter is calculated by dividing the nongaap subscription and support software revenue for the quarter by the number of days in the quarter and multiplying by 365 arr should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue as it is an operating measure and is not intended to be combined with or to replace either of those items arr is not a forecast and does not include perpetual license or professional services revenues 

nongaap financial measures 

the nongaap financial measures presented in the discussion of our results of operations and the respective most directly comparable gaap measures are 

 the nongaap financial measures exclude fair value adjustments related to acquired deferred revenue and deferred costs stockbased compensation expense amortization of acquired intangible assets expense acquisitionrelated charges pension plan terminationrelated costs a legal accrual restructuring charges nonoperating credit facility refinancing costs identified discrete charges included in nonoperating other expense net and the related tax effects of the preceding items and any other identified tax items 

these items are normally included in the comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with gaap our management excludes these items when evaluating our ongoing performance andor predicting our earnings trends and therefore excludes them when presenting nongaap financial measures management uses nongaap financial measures in conjunction with our gaap results as should investors 

settlement revenue exclusions  in q418 we settled a previously disclosed dispute with respect to a customer receivable the settlement included partial payment of the receivable and new software purchases the net revenue writedown recorded in q418 was 93 million comprised of a 145 million professional services revenue writedown partially offset by new subscription revenue of 52 million we 

excluded the professional services revenue writedown because the writedown related to revenue that was recorded in periods prior to fiscal 2017 and is not reflective of current operating performance and excluded the new subscription revenue because it mitigated the impact of the professional services revenue writedown 

fair value of acquired deferred revenue is a purchase accounting adjustment recorded to reduce acquired deferred revenue to the fair value of the remaining obligation so our gaap revenue after an acquisition does not reflect the full amount of revenue that would have been reported if the acquired deferred revenue was not written down to fair value we believe excluding these adjustments to revenue from these contracts and associated costs in fair value adjustment to deferred services cost  is useful to investors as an additional means to assess revenue trends of our business    

stockbased compensation is a noncash expense relating to stockbased awards issued to executive officers employees and outside directors consisting of restricted stock stock options and restricted stock units we exclude this expense as it is a noncash expense and we assess our internal operations excluding this expense and believe it facilitates comparisons to the performance of other companies in our industry 

amortization of acquired intangible assets is a noncash expense that is impacted by the timing and magnitude of our acquisitions we believe the assessment of our operations excluding these costs is relevant to our assessment of internal operations and comparisons to the performance of other companies in our industry 

acquisitionrelated and other transactional charges included in general and administrative costs are 

direct costs of potential and completed acquisitions and expenses related to acquisition integration 

activities including transaction fees due diligence costs severance and professional fees subsequent 

adjustments to our initial estimated amount of contingent consideration associated with specific 

acquisitions are also included within acquisitionrelated charges other transactional charges include 

thirdparty costs related to structuring unusual transactions we do not include these costs when 

reviewing our operating results internally the occurrence and amount of these costs will vary depending 

on the timing and size of acquisitions 

us pension plan terminationrelated costs include charges related to our plan that we began terminating in the second quarter of 2014 costs associated with termination of the plan are not considered part of our regular operations 

legal accrual includes amounts accrued to settle regulatory and other matters related to our sec and doj fcpa investigation in china we view these matters as nonordinary course events and exclude the amounts when reviewing our operating performance 

restructuring charges include severance costs and excess facility restructuring charges resulting from reductions of personnel driven by modifications to our business strategy these costs may vary in size based on our restructuring plan 

headquarters relocation charges include noncash accelerated depreciation expense recorded in anticipation of exiting our current headquarters facility due to changes in the estimated useful lives of fixed assets we do not include these costs when reviewing our operating results internally 

nonoperating credit facility refinancing costs  are nonoperating charges we record as a result of the refinancing of our credit facility we assess our internal operations excluding these costs and believe it facilitates comparisons to the performance of other companies in our industry 

income tax adjustments include the tax impact of the items above and assumes that we are profitable on a nongaap basis in the us and one foreign jurisdiction and eliminates the effect of the valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets in those jurisdictions additionally we exclude other material tax items that we view as nonordinary course 

we use these nongaap financial measures and we believe that they assist our investors to make periodtoperiod comparisons of our operational performance because they provide a view of our operating results without items that are not in our view indicative of our core operating results we believe that these nongaap financial measures help illustrate underlying trends in our business and we use the measures to establish budgets and operational goals communicated internally and externally for managing our business and evaluating our performance we believe that providing nongaap financial measures affords investors a view of our operating results that may be more easily compared to the results of peer companies 

the items excluded from the nongaap financial measures often have a material impact on our financial results and such items often recur accordingly the nongaap financial measures included in this annual report should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for or superior to the comparable measures prepared in accordance with gaap the following tables reconcile each of these nongaap financial measures to its most closely comparable gaap measure on our financial statements 





  

 



critical accounting policies and estimates 

we have prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america in preparing our financial statements we make estimates assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our reported revenues results of operations and net income as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet these estimates assumptions and judgments are made based on our historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances these estimates may change as new events occur or additional information is obtained and we may periodically be faced with uncertainties the outcomes of which are not within our control and may not be known for a prolonged period of time 

the accounting policies methods and estimates used to prepare our financial statements are described generally in  note b   summary of significant accounting policies  of notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report the most important accounting judgments and estimates that we made in preparing the financial statements involved 



 a critical accounting policy is one that is both material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires us to make subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies require us to make assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time of the estimate and different estimates that we could have used or changes in the estimates that are reasonably likely to occur may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process actual results could differ from those estimates 

accounting policies guidelines and interpretations related to our critical accounting policies and estimates are generally subject to numerous sources of authoritative guidance and are often reexamined by accounting standards rule makers and regulators these rule makers andor regulators may promulgate interpretations guidance or regulations that may result in changes to our accounting policies which could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 

revenue recognition 

our sources of revenue include 1 subscription 2 support 3 perpetual license and 4 professional services through 2018 we recorded revenues for software related deliverables in accordance with the guidance provided by asc 985605 softwarerevenue recognition and revenues for nonsoftware deliverables in accordance with   asc 60525  revenue recognition multipleelement arrangements under those standards revenue is recorded when the following criteria are met 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 2 delivery has occurred generally fob shipping point or electronic distribution 3 the fee is fixed or determinable and 4 collection is probable we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with determining the amounts of software license and services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period our primary judgments involve the following 

 our software is distributed primarily through our direct sales force in addition we have an indirect distribution channel through alliances with resellers revenue arrangements with resellers are generally recognized on a sellthrough basis that is when we deliver the product to the enduser customer we record consideration given to a reseller as a reduction of revenue to the extent we have recorded revenue from the reseller we do not offer contractual rights of return stock balancing or price protection to our resellers and actual product returns from them have been insignificant to date as a result we do not maintain reserves for reseller product returns 

at the time of each sale transaction we must make an assessment of the collectability of the amount due from the customer revenue is only recognized at that time if management deems that collection is probable in making this assessment we consider customer creditworthiness and historical payment experience at that same time we assess whether fees are fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties in assessing whether the fee is fixed or determinable we consider the payment terms of the transaction including transactions with payment terms that extend beyond our customary payment terms and our collection experience in similar transactions without making concessions among other factors we have periodically provided financing to creditworthy customers with payment terms up to 24  months if the fee is determined not to be fixed or determinable revenue is recognized only as payments become due from the customer provided that all other revenue 

recognition criteria are met our software license arrangements generally do not include customer acceptance provisions however if an arrangement includes an acceptance provision we record revenue only upon the earlier of 1 receipt of written acceptance from the customer or 2 expiration of the acceptance period 

generally our contracts are accounted for individually however when contracts are closely interrelated and dependent on each other it may be necessary to account for two or more contracts as one to reflect the substance of the group of contracts 

subscription 

subscription revenue includes revenue from two primary sources 1 subscriptionbased licenses and 2 cloud services 

subscriptionbased licenses include the right for a customer to use our onpremise licenses and receive related support for a specified term and revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement since we do not have vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” of fair value for our coterminous support when sold in arrangements with other elements vsoe of fair value is established for the subscriptionbased licenses through the use of a substantive renewal clause within the customer contract for a combined annual fee that includes the termbased license and related support 

cloud services revenue which in 2018 2017 and 2016 represented less than 5  of our total revenue includes fees for hosting and application management of customers’ perpetual or subscriptionbased licenses hosting services and fees for software as a service saas arrangements when hosting services are sold as part of a multielement transaction revenue is allocated to hosting services based on vsoe and recognized ratably over the contractual term beginning on the commencement dates of each contract which is the date the services are made available to the customer vsoe is established for hosting services either through a substantive stated renewal option or stated contractual overage rates as these rates represent the value the customer is willing to pay on a standalone basis we also offer cloud services under saas arrangements whereby customers access our software in the cloud under saas arrangements customers cannot take possession of the software cloud services include setup fees which are recognized ratably over the contract term or the expected customer life whichever is longer 

support 

support contracts generally include rights to unspecified upgrades when and if available telephone and internetbased support updates and bug fixes support revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the support contract on a straightline basis 

perpetual license 

under perpetual license arrangements we generally recognize license revenue up front upon shipment to the customer we use the residual method to recognize revenue from perpetual license software arrangements that include one or more elements to be delivered at a future date when evidence of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists and the elements of the arrangement qualify for separate accounting as described below under the residual method the fair value of the undelivered elements ie support and services based on our vsoe of fair value is deferred and the remaining portion of the total arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements ie perpetual software license if evidence of the fair value of one or more of the undelivered elements does not exist all revenues are deferred and recognized when delivery of all of those elements has occurred or when fair values can be established we determine vsoe of the fair value of services and support revenue based upon our recent pricing for those elements when sold separately for certain transactions vsoe is determined based on a substantive renewal clause within a customer contract our current pricing practices are influenced primarily by product type purchase volume sales channel and customer location we review services and support sold separately on a periodic basis and update when appropriate our vsoe of fair value for such elements to ensure that it reflects our recent pricing experience 

professional services 

our software arrangements often include implementation consulting and training services that are sold under consulting engagement contracts or as part of the software license arrangement when we determine that such services are not essential to the functionality of the licensed software we record revenue separately for the license and service elements of these arrangements provided that 

appropriate evidence of fair value exists for the undelivered services ie vsoe of fair value we consider various factors in assessing whether a service is not essential to the functionality of the software including if the services may be provided by independent third parties experienced in providing such services ie consulting and implementation in coordination with dedicated customer personnel and whether the services result in significant modification or customization of the software’s functionality when professional services qualify for separate accounting professional services revenues under time and materials billing arrangements are recognized as the services are performed professional services revenues under fixedpriced contracts are generally recognized as the services are performed using a proportionate performance model with hours or costs as the input method of attribution 

when we provide professional services that are considered essential to the functionality of the software the arrangement does not qualify for separate accounting of the license and service elements and the license revenue is recognized together with the consulting services using the percentageofcompletion method of contract accounting under such arrangements consideration is recognized as the services are performed as measured by an observable input in these circumstances we separate license revenue from service revenue for income statement presentation by allocating vsoe of fair value of the consulting services as service revenue and the residual portion as license revenue under the percentageofcompletion method we estimate the stage of completion of contracts with fixed or “not to exceed” fees based on hours or costs incurred to date as compared with estimated total project hours or costs at completion adjustments to estimates to complete are made in the periods in which facts resulting in a change become known when total cost estimates exceed revenues we accrue for the estimated losses when identified the use of the proportionate performance and percentageofcompletion methods of accounting require significant judgment relative to estimating total contract costs or hours hours being a proxy for costs including assumptions relative to the length of time to complete the project the nature and complexity of the work to be performed and anticipated changes in salaries and other costs 

reimbursements of outofpocket expenditures incurred in connection with providing consulting services are included in professional services revenue with the offsetting expense recorded in cost of professional services revenue 

training services include onsite and classroom training training revenues are recognized as the related training services are provided 

accounting for income taxes 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to calculate our income tax expense based on taxable income by jurisdiction there are many transactions and calculations about which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain as a result our calculations involve estimates by management some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenuesharing costreimbursement and transfer pricing arrangements among related entities and the differing tax treatment of revenue and cost items across various jurisdictions if we were compelled to revise or to account differently for our arrangements that revision could affect our tax liability 

the income tax accounting process also involves estimating our actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheets we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized we must establish a valuation allowance as a charge to income tax expense 

as of september 30 2018 we have a valuation allowance of 1086 million  against net deferred tax assets in the us and a valuation allowance of 333 million  against net deferred tax assets in certain foreign jurisdictions we have concluded based on the weight of available evidence that a full valuation allowance continues to be required against our us net deferred tax assets as they are not more likely than not to be realized in the future we will continue to reassess our valuation allowance requirements each financial reporting period 

the valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets of certain foreign jurisdictions is established primarily for our net operating loss carryforwards the majority of which do not expire there 

are limitations imposed on the utilization of such net operating losses that could further restrict the recognition of any tax benefits 

prior to the passage of the us tax act the company asserted that substantially all of the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries were considered indefinitely invested and accordingly no deferred taxes were provided pursuant to the provisions of the us tax act these earnings were subjected to a onetime transition tax we maintain our assertion to permanently reinvest these earnings outside the us unless repatriation can be done with no significant tax cost with the exception of a foreign holding company formed in 2018 and our taiwan subsidiary if we decide to repatriate any additional nonus earnings in the future we may be required to establish a deferred tax liability on such earnings the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability on the undistributed earnings would not be material 

in the normal course of business ptc and its subsidiaries are examined by various taxing authorities including the internal revenue service irs in the us we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate we are currently under audit by tax authorities in several jurisdictions audits by tax authorities typically involve examination of the deductibility of certain permanent items transfer pricing limitations on net operating losses and tax credits although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in material changes in our estimates 

valuation of assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations 

in accordance with business combination accounting we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values determining these fair values requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets 

our identifiable intangible assets acquired consist of developed technology core technology tradenames customer lists and contracts and software support agreements and related relationships developed technology consists of products that have reached technological feasibility core technology represents a combination of processes inventions and trade secrets related to the design and development of acquired products customer lists and contracts and software support agreements and related relationships represent the underlying relationships and agreements with customers of the acquired company’s installed base we have generally valued intangible assets using a discounted cash flow model critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to 

 in addition we estimate the useful lives of our intangible assets based upon the expected period over which we anticipate generating economic benefits from the related intangible asset 

net tangible assets consist of the fair values of tangible assets less the fair values of assumed liabilities and obligations except for deferred revenues net tangible assets were generally valued by us at the respective carrying amounts recorded by the acquired company if we believed that their carrying values approximated their fair values at the acquisition date the values assigned to deferred revenue reflect an amount equivalent to the estimated cost plus an appropriate profit margin to perform the services related to the acquired company’s software support contracts 

in addition uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date and we reevaluate these items quarterly with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill provided that we are within the measurement period up to one year from the acquisition date and we continue 

to collect information in order to determine their estimated values subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the estimated value of uncertain tax positions or tax related valuation allowances whichever comes first changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of operations 

our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable at that time but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions estimates or actual results 

when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a finitelived intangible asset may not be recoverable we perform an assessment of the asset for potential impairment this assessment is based on projected undiscounted future cash flows over the asset’s remaining life if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its undiscounted cash flows we record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset determined using projected discounted future cash flows of the asset 

valuation of goodwill 

our goodwill totaled 11825 million and 11828 million  as of september 30 2018  and 2017  respectively we assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level our reporting units are determined based on the components of our operating segments that constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and for which operating results are regularly reviewed by segment management we have two operating and reportable segments 1 software products and 2 professional services 

as of september 30 2018  goodwill and acquired intangible assets in the aggregate attributable to our software products and professional services segment was 13524 million  and 302 million  respectively as of september 30 2017  goodwill and acquired intangible assets in the aggregate attributable to our software products and professional services segment was 14100 million  and 306 million  respectively we test goodwill for impairment in the third quarter of our fiscal year or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting segment below its carrying value factors we consider important on an overall company basis and reportable segment basis as applicable that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results significant changes in our use of the acquired assets or a significant change in the strategy for our business significant negative industry or economic trends a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period or a reduction of our market capitalization relative to net book value 

 we completed our annual goodwill impairment review as of june 30 2018 based on a qualitative assessment our qualitative assessment included company specific financial performance and longrange plans industry and macroeconomic factors and consideration of the fair value of each reporting unit which was approximately double its carrying value or higher at july 2 2016 the last valuation date based on our qualitative assessment we believe it is more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units exceed their carrying values and no further impairment testing is required 

accounting for pensions 

we sponsor several international pension plans we make assumptions that are used in calculating the expense and liability of these plans these key assumptions include the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate used to determine the present value of benefit obligations in selecting the expected longterm rate of return on assets we consider the average future rate of earnings expected on the funds invested to provide for the benefits under the pension plan this includes considering the plans asset allocations and the expected returns likely to be earned over the life of the plans the discount rate reflects the estimated rate at which an amount that is invested in a portfolio of highquality debt instruments would provide the future cash flows necessary to pay benefits when they come due the actuarial assumptions used by us may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions or longer or shorter life spans of the participants our actual results could differ materially from those we estimated which could require us to record a greater amount of pension expense in future years andor require higher than expected cash contributions 

accounting and reporting for these plans requires the use of countryspecific assumptions for discount rates and expected rates of return on assets we apply a consistent methodology in determining the key assumptions that in addition to future experience assumptions such as mortality rates are used by our actuaries to determine our liability and expense for each of these plans the discount rate for germany was selected with reference to a spotrate yield curve based on the yields of aarated eurodenominated corporate bonds in addition our actuarial consultants determine the expense and liabilities of the plan using other assumptions for future experience such as mortality rates in determining our pension cost for 2018  2017  and 2016  we used weighted average discount rates of 18  13  and 22  respectively and weighted average expected returns on plan assets of 54  54  and 57  respectively in 2018  2017  and 2016  our actual return loss on plan assets was 10 million  63 million and 17 million respectively if actual returns are below our expected rates of return it will impact the amount and timing of future contributions and expense for these plans 

as of september 30 2018  and 2017  our plans in total were underfunded representing the difference between our projected benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets by 177 million  and 167 million  respectively the projected benefit obligation as of september 30 2018  was determined using a weighted average discount rate of 19  the most sensitive assumptions used in calculating the expense and liability of our pension plans are the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets total gaap net periodic pension cost was 09 million  in 2018  and we expect it to be approximately 12 million  in 2019  a 50 basis point change to our discount rate and expected return on plan assets assumptions would have changed our pension expense for the year ended september 30 2018 by approximately 1   million a 50 basis point decrease in our discount rate assumptions would increase our projected benefit obligation as of september 30 2018 by approximately 7 million 

legal contingencies 

we are periodically subject to various legal claims and involved in various legal proceedings we routinely review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any matter is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we record a liability for the estimated loss significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether the amount of an exposure is reasonably estimable because of inherent uncertainties related to these legal matters we base our loss accruals on the best information available at the time further estimates of this nature are highly subjective and the final outcome of these matters could vary significantly from the amounts that have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as additional information becomes available we reassess our potential liability and may revise our estimates such revisions could have a material impact on future quarterly or annual results of operations 

liquidity and capital resources 

  

cash and cash equivalents 

we invest our cash with highly rated financial institutions and in diversified domestic and international money market mutual funds cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with original 

maturities of three months or less in addition we hold investments in marketable securities totaling approximately 560 million  with an average maturity of 14 months at september 30 2018  cash and cash equivalents totaled 2599 million  compared to 2800 million  at september 30 2017  reflecting 2478 million  in operating cash flow 10157 million  of proceeds from issuance of common stock of which 1 billion was related to an investment in ptc by rockwell automation and the remainder of which relates to common stock issued under our employee stock purchase plan the proceeds from the rockwell automation investment were used in part for repurchases of 11000 million  in common stock in addition we made 700 million  of net repayments under our credit facility 454 million  was used to pay withholding taxes on stockbased awards that vested in the period 360 million  was used for capital expenditures 89 million was used for the payment of contingent consideration 60 million was used to purchase business and intangible assets and 62 million was used to purchase marketable securities net of proceeds from maturities 

cash provided by operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities was 2478 million  in 2018  compared to 1352 million  in 2017  and 1833 million  in 2016  the increase in 2018 is primarily due to higher cash collection of accounts receivable of 1290 million an increase in net income of 457 million lower restructuring payments 343 million year over year and a 12 million payment related to a korean tax audit made in 2017 

the decrease in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to an increase in bonus and commission payments of approximately 33 million lower cash collections from accounts receivable of 27 million due to higher 2016 collections of receivables with extended payment terms and a higher subscription mix in 2017  higher interest payments of approximately 26 million   and a 12 million payment related to a korean tax audit partially offset by a   35 million increase in cash flows from accounts payable and accrued expenses due to renegotiations with vendors and more effective utilization of available payment terms   18 million of lower restructuring payments and 28 million paid in 2016 to resolve the regulatory investigation with respect to our china business 

 restructuring payments totaled 28 million  in 2018 compared to 371 million  in 2017 and 550 million  in 2016 cash paid for income taxes was 226 million  354 million  and 255 million  in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively 

cash used by investing activities   



the 2018 increase in property plant and equipment payments is primarily attributable to expenditures made for construction of our new worldwide headquarters in the boston seaport district we also used net 6 million to purchase additional marketable securities 3 million to acquire developed software 3 million for a small business acquisition and 1 million for a small investment in a technology company 

in 2017 we spent approximately 5 million on acquisitions and sold a minority investment in preferred stock for approximately 15 million 

in 2016 we acquired kepware for 994 million  net of cash acquired and vuforia for 648 million  net of cash acquired in 2016 we initiated an ongoing investment strategy whereby a portion of 

available cash balances were used to purchase investment grade securities with maturities up to three years 

our expenditures for property and equipment consist primarily of computer equipment software office equipment and facility improvements 

cash provided used by financing activities 



in 2018 we resumed our stock repurchase program and used 11000 million  to repurchase our common stock for the repurchases made in 2018 we used 1 billion from an equity investment in ptc made by rockwell automation and 100 million in cash provided by operating activities proceeds from issuance of common stock of 10157 million  includes 1 billion from the rockwell automation investment in ptc and 157 million of proceeds from our employee stock purchase plan in 2018 we repaid 700 million  under our credit facility in 2018 credit facility origination costs included costs associated with the modification of our credit facility 

credit agreement 

in september 2018 we amended and restated our existing credit facility to increase the revolving loan commitment from 600 million to 700 million and amend other provisions the credit facility is a multicurrency credit facility with a syndicate of sixteen banks for which jpmorgan chase bank na acts as administrative agent outstanding revolving loan amounts may be repaid in whole or in part without penalty or premium prior to the september 13 2023 maturity date when all remaining amounts outstanding will be due and payable in full 

we use the credit facility for general corporate purposes including acquisitions of businesses share repurchases and working capital requirements as of september 30 2018 we had 1481 million  in revolving loans outstanding under the credit facility the fair value of which approximated its book value as of september 30 2018 we have approximately 552 million undrawn of which 535 million would be available to borrow the availability of which is reduced by letters of credit and certain other longterm liabilities 

any borrowings by ptc inc or certain of our foreign subsidiaries under the credit facility would be guaranteed respectively by our material domestic subsidiaries that become parties to the subsidiary guaranty if any andor by ptc inc borrowings are also secured by first priority liens on property of ptc and certain of our material domestic subsidiaries including 100 of the voting equity interests of certain of our domestic subsidiaries and 65 of our material firsttier foreign subsidiaries loans under the credit facility bear interest at variable rates that reset every 30 to 180 days depending on the rate and period selected by us and based upon our total leverage ratio during 2018 the weighted average annual interest rate for all borrowings outstanding was 517  and as of september 30 2018 the rate on the credit facility was 38  we also pay a quarterly commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the credit facility ranging from 0175 to 030 per year based on our total leverage ratio 

the credit facility imposes customary covenants that limit our ability to incur liens or guarantee obligations pay dividends and make other distributions make investments and engage in certain other transactions in addition we and our material domestic subsidiaries may not invest in or loan to our 

foreign subsidiaries in aggregate amounts exceeding 100 million for any purpose and an additional 200 million for acquisitions of businesses we also must maintain the following financial ratios 



       any failure to comply with such covenants would prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds and would constitute a default permitting the lenders to among other things accelerate the amounts outstanding and terminate the credit facility as of september 30 2018 we were in compliance with all financial and operating covenants of the credit facility 

outstanding notes 

on may 12 2016 we issued 500 million of 600 senior notes due 2024 the “2024 6 notes” in a registered offering and used the net proceeds to repay indebtedness under our senior credit facility as of september 30 2018 unamortized deferred financing fees associated with the offering and presented as a direct reduction from the carrying amount of the 2024 6 notes were 49 million  

the 2024 6 notes are unsecured mature on may 15 2024 and bear interest at a rate of 600 per annum payable semiannually november and may at any time before may 15 2019 i we may redeem up to 40 of the aggregate principal amount of the 2024 6 notes with the net cash proceeds of certain public equity offerings at a price equal to 10600 of the aggregate principal amount redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest provided that at least 60 of the 2024 6 notes that were originally issued remain outstanding immediately thereafter and ii we may redeem some or all of the 2024 6 notes at a price equal to 100 of the aggregate principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest and a makewhole premium on or after may 15 2019 we may redeem some or all of the 2024 6 notes at redemption prices specified in the 2024 6 notes plus accrued and unpaid interest in addition if we undergo a change of control we will be required to make an offer to purchase all the 2024 6 notes at a price equal to 101 of the principal amount of the 2024 6 notes plus accrued and unpaid interest 

the notes were issued under an indenture that contains customary covenants subject to certain exceptions our ability to incur certain additional debt is limited unless after giving pro forma effect to such incurrence and the application of the proceeds thereof the ratio of our ebitda to our consolidated fixed charges as both terms are defined in the indenture is not greater than 200 to 100 the indenture also restricts our ability to incur liens pay dividends or make certain other distributions sell assets or engage in saleleaseback transactions any failure to comply with these and other covenants included in the indenture could constitute an event of default that could result in the acceleration of the payment of the aggregate principal amount of 2024 6 notes then outstanding and accrued interest as of september 30 2018 we were in compliance with all such covenants 

share repurchase authorization 

our articles of organization authorize us to issue up to 500 million shares of our common stock our board of directors has authorized us to repurchase up to 1500 million of our common stock for the october 1 2017 through september 30 2020 period we intend to use cash from operations and borrowings under our credit facility to make such repurchases all shares of our common stock repurchased are automatically restored to the status of authorized and unissued 

in 2018 we repurchased 94 million shares the repurchases were made under two accelerated repurchase asr agreements we completed the 100 million asr repurchase in the third quarter of 2018 we entered into a 1000 million asr in july 2018 shares valued at 800 million in the aggregate were delivered to us upon entry into the asr the remaining 200 million represents the amount held back by the bank counterparty pending final settlement of the asr which is expected to occur in the second or third quarter of 2019 upon settlement of the asr the total shares repurchased by us will equal 1000 million divided by the average daily volume weightedaverage price of our common stock during the term of the asr program less a fixed per share discount we used the 1 billion in proceeds from the rockwell automation equity investment in ptc and 100 million of cash from operations to make the repurchases 

in 2017 we repurchased 09 million shares at cost of 510 million in 2016 we did not repurchase any shares due to our transition to a subscription business model and the nearterm impact on free cash flow and ebitda 

expectations for fiscal 2019 

our transition to a subscription licensing model has had and will continue to have an adverse impact on revenue operating margin and eps relative to periods in which we primarily sold perpetual licenses until the expected transition of our customer base to subscription is completed this also affects consolidated ebitda as calculated under our credit facility and as a result of the total leverage ratio under the facility limits the amount we can borrow under the facility notwithstanding the effect of the subscription transition and those limitations we believe that existing cash and cash equivalents together with cash generated from operations and amounts available under the credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements which we expect to be 40 million in 2019 through at least the next twelve months and to meet our known longterm capital requirements 

our expected uses of cash could change our cash position could be reduced and we could incur additional debt obligations if we purchase our outstanding shares or retire debt or engage in strategic transactions any of which could be commenced suspended or completed at any time any such purchases or retirement of debt will depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors we also evaluate possible strategic transactions on an ongoing basis and at any given time may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to possible strategic transactions the amounts involved in any share or debt repurchases or strategic transactions may be material 

we ended 2018 with a cash balance of 260 million and marketable securities of 56 million a significant portion of our cash is generated and held outside of the united states at september 30 2018 we had cash and cash equivalents of 296 million  in the united states 885 million  in europe 956 million  in the pacific rim including india 148 million  in japan and 314 million  in other nonus countries all of the marketable securities are held in europe we have substantial cash requirements in the united states but we believe that the combination of our existing us cash and cash equivalents marketable securities and future us operating cash flows and cash available under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our ongoing us operating expenses and known capital requirements 

contractual obligations 

at september 30 2018  our contractual obligations were as follows 



  

 as of september 30 2018  we had letters of credit and bank guarantees outstanding of approximately 155 million  of which 11 million  was collateralized primarily related to our corporate headquarters lease in needham massachusetts 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have not created and are not party to any specialpurpose or offbalance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital incurring debt or operating parts of our business that are not consolidated to the extent of our ownership interest therein into our financial statements we have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby we have subordinated retained interests derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks contingent liabilities or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing liquidity market risk or credit risk support to us 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in accordance with recently issued accounting pronouncements we will be required to comply with certain changes in accounting rules and regulations refer to note b summary of significant accounting policies  to the condensed consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for all recently issued accounting pronouncements we are currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on our consolidated financial statements outlined below are the recent accounting pronouncements that we believe will have the most significant impact on us 

income taxes 

in october 2016 the fasb issued asu 201616 income taxes topic 740 intraentity transfers of assets other than inventory “asu 201616” the purpose of asu 201616 is to simplify the income tax accounting of an intraentity transfer of an asset other than inventory and to record its effect when the transfer occurs the guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 our fiscal 2019 including interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods and early adoption is permitted we are currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on our consolidated financial statements we expect to record a net deferred tax asset of approximately 72 million  upon adoption primarily relating to deductible amortization of intangible assets in ireland post adoption our effective tax rate will no longer include the benefit of this amortization which is reflected in our effective tax rate reconciliation under the current guidance 

leases 

in february 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201602 leases topic 842 which will replace the existing guidance in asc 840 leases the updated standard aims to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by requiring lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and to disclose important information about leasing arrangements asu 201602 is effective for annual periods beginning after december 15 2018 our fiscal 2020 and interim periods within those annual periods early adoption is permitted and modified retrospective application is required we are currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 asc 606 asc 606 supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under us gaap the fasb has also issued additional standards to provide clarification and implementation guidance on asc 606 

the core principle of asc 606 is to recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services under the new guidance an entity is required to evaluate revenue recognition through a fivestep process 1 identifying a contract with a customer 2 identifying the performance obligations in the contract 3 determining the transaction price 4 allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and 5 recognizing revenue when or as the entity satisfies a performance obligation the standard also requires disclosure of the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers in applying the principles of asc 606 it is possible more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than is required under existing us gaap including identifying performance obligations estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and estimating the value of each performance obligation to allocate the total transaction price to each separate performance obligation 

asc 606 is effective for us in the first quarter of our fiscal 2019 companies may adopt asc 606 using either the retrospective method under which each prior reporting period is presented under asc 606 

with the option to elect certain permitted practical expedients or the modified retrospective method under which a company adopts asc 606 from the beginning of the year of initial application with no restatement of comparative periods with the cumulative effect of initially applying asc 606 recognized at the date of initial application and with certain additional required disclosures we are adopting asc 606 using the modified retrospective method 

while we are continuing to assess the impact of the new standard we currently believe the most significant impact relates to accounting for our subscription arrangements that include termbased onpremise software licenses bundled with support andor cloud services under current gaap the revenue attributable to these subscription licenses bundled with support is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement because vsoe does not exist for the undelivered support element as it is not sold separately under the new standard the requirement to have vsoe for undelivered elements to enable the separation of revenue for the delivered software licenses is eliminated accordingly under the new standard we will be required to recognize as revenue a portion of the subscription fee upon delivery of the software license for subscriptions arrangements that also include cloud services the company assessed whether the cloud component was highly interrelated with the onpremise term software license other than a limited population of subscriptions the cloud component is currently not deemed to be interrelated with the onpremise term software and as a result cloud services will be accounted for as a separate distinct performance obligation we do have a limited number of subscriptions that incorporate substantial cloud services where cloud services are not distinct from the onpremise term license in the context of the contracts as they are considered highly interrelated and represent a single performance obligation for which the revenue will continue to be recognized over time we currently expect revenue related to our perpetual license revenue and related support contracts professional services and cloud offerings to remain substantially unchanged due to the complexity of certain of our contracts the actual revenue recognition treatment required under the new standard may be dependent on contractspecific terms and therefore may vary in some instances 

upon implementation of the new standard in fiscal 2019 we expect to make revisions to contract terms with our customers for new orders that will result in shortening the initial noncancellable term of our multiyear subscriptions to one year this change will result in annual contractual periods for the majority of our software subscriptions the license portion of which will be recognized at the beginning of each annual contract period upon delivery of the licenses and the support portion of which will be recognized ratably over the one year contractual period as a result we anticipate one year of subscription revenue will be recognized for each contract each year however more of the revenue will be recognized in the quarter that the contract period begins and less will be recognized in the subsequent three quarters of the contract than under the current accounting rules 

under the modified retrospective method we will evaluate each contract that is ongoing on the adoption date as if that contract had been accounted for under asc 606 from contract inception some license revenue related to subscription arrangements that would have been recognized in future periods under current gaap will be recast under asc 606 as if the revenue had been recognized in prior periods under this transition method we will not adjust historical reported revenue amounts instead the revenue that would have been recognized under this method prior to the adoption date will be an adjustment to retained earnings and will not be recognized as revenue in future periods as previously planned because we expect that license revenue associated with subscription contracts will be recognized up front instead of over time under asc 606 we expect approximately 350 million to 380 million will be adjusted to retained earnings upon adoption related to billed and unbilled deferred revenue during the first year of adoption we will disclose the amount of this retained earnings adjustment and intend to provide supplemental disclosure of how this revenue would have been recognized under the current rules 

another significant provision under asc 606 includes the capitalization and amortization of costs associated with obtaining and fulfilling a contract currently substantially all of these costs are expensed in the period incurred under asc 606 direct and incremental costs to acquire a contract are capitalized and amortized using a systematic basis over the pattern of transfer of the goods and services to which the asset relates under asc 606 we estimate approximately 70 million of commission costs will be capitalized and amortized over the period the capitalized assets are expected to contribute to future cash flows 

furthermore we have made and will continue to make investments in systems and processes to enable timely and accurate reporting under the new standard we are implementing operational and internal control structural changes 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we face exposure to financial market risks including adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 

foreign currency exchange risk 

our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to western european countries japan israel china and canada we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates that arise from receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies we do not enter into or hold foreign currency derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes nor do we enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge future cash flow or forecast transactions 

our nonus revenues generally are transacted through our nonus subsidiaries and typically are denominated in their local currency in addition expenses that are incurred by our nonus subsidiaries typically are denominated in their local currency in 2018 2017 and 2016 approximately twothirds of our revenue and half of our expenses were transacted in currencies other than the us dollar currency translation affects our reported results because we report our results of operations in us dollars historically our most significant currency risk has been changes in the euro and japanese yen relative to the us dollar based on current revenue and expense levels excluding restructuring charges and stockbased compensation a 010 change in the usd to european exchange rates and a 10 yen change in the yen to usd exchange rate would impact operating income by approximately 16 million and 6 million respectively 

our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations arises in part from intercompany transactions with most intercompany transactions occurring between a us dollar functional currency entity and a foreign currency denominated entity intercompany transactions typically are denominated in the local currency of the nonus dollar functional currency subsidiary in order to centralize foreign currency risk also both ptc the parent company and our nonus subsidiaries may transact business with our customers and vendors in a currency other than their functional currency transaction risk in addition we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results and balances of our nonus subsidiaries are translated into us dollars translation risk if sales to customers outside of the united states increase our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will increase 

our foreign currency risk management strategy is principally designed to mitigate the future potential financial impact of changes in the us dollar value of balances denominated in foreign currency resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates our foreign currency hedging program uses forward contracts to manage the foreign currency exposures that exist as part of our ongoing business operations the contracts primarily are denominated in canadian dollars and european currencies and have maturities of less than three months 

generally we do not designate foreign currency forward contracts as hedges for accounting purposes and changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized immediately in earnings because we enter into forward contracts only as an economic hedge any gain or loss on the underlying foreigndenominated balance would be offset by the loss or gain on the forward contract gains and losses on forward contracts and foreign denominated receivables and payables are included in foreign currency net losses 

as of september 30 2018  and 2017  we had outstanding forward contracts for derivatives not designated as hedging instruments with notional amounts equivalent to the following     

as of september 30 2018  and 2017  we had outstanding forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges with notional amounts equivalent to the following 

debt 

 in addition to amounts due under our 2024 6 notes as described above as of september 30 2018  we had 1481 million  outstanding under our variablerate credit facility loans under the credit facility bear interest at variable rates which reset every 30  to 180  days depending on the rate and period selected by us these loans are subject to interest rate risk as interest rates will be adjusted at each rollover date to the extent such amounts are not repaid as of september 30 2018  the annual rate on the credit facility loans was 38  if there was a hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates the annual net impact to earnings and cash flows would be 15 million this hypothetical change in cash flows and earnings has been calculated based on the borrowings outstanding at september 30 2017 and a 100 basis point per annum change in interest rate applied over a oneyear period 

cash and cash equivalents 

as of september 30 2018  cash equivalents were invested in highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased we invest our cash with highly rated financial institutions in north america europe and asiapacific and in diversified domestic and international money market mutual funds at september 30 2018  we had cash and cash equivalents of 296 million  in the united states 885 million  in europe 956 million  in the pacific rim including india 148 million  in japan and 314 million  in other nonus countries given the short maturities and investment grade quality of the portfolio holdings at september 30 2018  a hypothetical 10 change in interest rates would not materially affect the fair value of our cash and cash equivalents 

our invested cash is subject to interest rate fluctuations and for nonus operations foreign currency risk in a declining interest rate environment we would experience a decrease in interest income the opposite holds true in a rising interest rate environment over the past several years the us federal reserve board european central bank and bank of england have changed certain benchmark interest rates which have led to declines and increases in market interest rates these changes in market interest rates have resulted in fluctuations in interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents interest income will continue to fluctuate based on changes in market interest rates and levels of cash available for investment our consolidated cash balances were impacted favorably by 78 million  and 11 million  in 2018  and 2017  respectively and unfavorably by 68 million  in 2016  due to changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar particularly the euro and the japanese yen

risk factors 

tableend 

the following are important factors we have identified that could affect our future results you should consider them carefully when evaluating an investment in ptc securities or any forwardlooking statements made by us including those contained in this annual report because these factors could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or the performance projected in forwardlooking statements the risks described below are not the only risks we face additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business financial condition andor operating results holders of the 600 senior notes due 2024 the “2024 6 notes” that we issued in may 2016 should also consider the risk factors related to those notes described in the prospectus we filed with the securities and exchange commission on may 5 2016 which are incorporated herein by reference 

i operational considerations 

our operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter making future operating results difficult to predict failure to meet market expectations could cause the price of our securities to decline 

our quarterly operating results historically have fluctuated and are likely to continue to fluctuate depending on a number of factors including 

 accordingly our quarterly results are difficult to predict prior to the end of the quarter and we may be unable to confirm or adjust expectations with respect to our operating results for a particular quarter until that quarter has closed any failure to meet our quarterly revenue or earnings targets could adversely impact the market price of our securities 

we now offer our solutions as subscriptions which has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our nearterm revenue and earnings in the transition period and make predicting our revenue and earnings more difficult 

we began offering most of our solutions under a subscription option in 2015 in addition to a perpetual license option under a subscription customers pay a periodic fee for the right to use our software and receive support or to use our cloud services and have us manage the application for a specified period under a subscription revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the subscription while under a perpetual license revenue is generally recognized upon purchase a significant number of our customers have elected to purchase our solutions as subscriptions rather than under perpetual licenses as a result our license revenues have declined our support revenue which comprises a significant portion of our revenue has also decreased due to support services being included in the subscription offering and to customers converting their support contracts into subscriptions we intend to discontinue sales of perpetual licenses in the americas and western europe as of january 1 2018 which will likely accelerate these effects on our revenue until we complete the subscription transition 

our revenue and earnings targets are based on assumptions about the mix of revenue that will be attributable to subscription and perpetual license revenue if a greater percentage of our customers elect to purchase our solutions as subscriptions in a period than we assumed our revenue and earnings will likely fall below our expectations for that period as occurred in 2017 and 2016 which could cause our stock price to decline 

we may not be able to predict subscription renewal rates and their impact on our future revenue and operating results 

although our subscription solutions are designed to increase the number of customers that purchase our solutions as subscriptions and create a recurring revenue stream that increases and is more predictable over time our customers are not required to renew their subscriptions for our solutions and they may elect not to renew when or as we expect customer renewal rates may decline or fluctuate due to a number of factors including offering pricing competitive offerings customer satisfaction and reductions in customer spending levels or customer activity due to economic downturns or other market uncertainty if our customers do not renew their subscriptions when or as we expect or if they renew on less favorable terms our revenues and earnings may decline 

our long range financial targets are predicated on bookings and revenue growth and operating margin improvements that we may fail to achieve which could reduce our expected earnings and cause us to fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors and cause the price of our securities to decline 

we are projecting longterm bookings revenue and earnings growth our projections are based on the expected growth potential in the iot market as well as more modest growth in our core cad plm and slm markets we may not achieve the expected bookings and revenue growth if the markets we serve do not grow at expected rates if customers do not purchase renew or expand subscriptions as we expect if we are not able to deliver solutions desired by customers and potential customers andor if acquired businesses do not generate the revenue growth that we expect 

our longterm operating margin improvement targets are predicated on operating leverage as long range revenue increases and on improved operating efficiencies particularly within our sales organization and on service margin improvements services margins are significantly lower than license and support margins future projected improvements in our operating margin as a percent of revenue are based in part on our ability to improve services margins by reducing the amount of direct services that we perform through expansion of our service partner program and improving the profitability of services that we perform if our services revenue increases as a percentage of total revenue andor if we are unable to improve our services margins our overall operating margin may not increase to the levels we expect or may decrease additionally if we do not achieve lower sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue through productivity initiatives we may not achieve our operating margin targets if operating margins do not improve our earnings could be adversely affected and the price of our securities could decline 

our significant investment in our iot business may not generate the revenues we expect which could adversely affect our business and financial results 

we have made significant investments in recent years in our iot business including five acquisitions totaling approximately 550 million our iot business provides technology solutions that enable customers to transform their businesses and leverage the opportunities created by the iot 

the internet of things is a relatively new market and there are a significant number of competitors in the market if the market does not expand as rapidly as we or others expect or if customers adopt competitive solutions rather than our solutions our iot business may not generate the revenues we expect further our customers and potential customers often begin the process of implementing iot with a proofofconcept evaluation in some cases with multiple different technology vendors our pace of growth in this emerging market will depend on our ability to engage with customers to ensure that their investment moves beyond planning to broader deployment and yields value at their desired speed and expected costs 

further one market for our iot business is as a platform provider to a broad ecosystem of application and solutions providers this market relies on an extensive and differentiated partner ecosystem to enable us to access markets and customers beyond our traditional markets customers and buyers we may be unable to expand our partner ecosystem as we expect and developers may not adopt our iot solutions as we expect which would adversely affect our ability to realize revenue from our investments in this business 

we may be unable to hire or retain personnel with the technical skills necessary to further develop our software products which could adversely affect our ability to compete 

our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical personnel to develop our products competition for such personnel in our industry is intense especially for personnel with augmented and virtual reality and analytics expertise as there are comparatively fewer persons with those skills if we are unable to attract and retain technical personnel with the requisite skills our product development efforts could be delayed which could adversely affect our ability to compete and thereby adversely our revenues and profitability 

we depend on sales within the discrete manufacturing sector and our business could be adversely affected if manufacturing activity does not grow or if it contracts 

a large amount of our sales are to customers in the discrete manufacturing sector if this economic sector does not grow or if it contracts our customers in this sector may as they have in the past reduce or defer purchases of our products and services which adversely affects our business in 2016 and 2015 the manufacturing sector was weak worldwide which we believe adversely impacted our sales and 

operating results although conditions improved during 2017 if manufacturing economic conditions do not continue to improve or if they deteriorate our revenue and earnings could be adversely affected 

we face significant competition which may reduce our profits and limit or reduce our market share 

the market for product development solutions and iot solutions is rapidly changing and characterized by vigorous competition both by entry of competitors with innovative technologies and by consolidation of companies with complementary products and technologies this competition could result in price reductions for our products and services reduced margins loss of customers and loss of market share our primary competition comes from 

 in addition barriers to entry into certain segments of the software industry have declined and the ability of customers to adopt software solutions has increased with the ability to offer software in the cloud and the increasing prevalence of subscription license models and customer acceptance of both those models because of these and other factors competitive conditions in the industry are likely to intensify in the future 

increased competition could result in price reductions reduced net revenue and profit margins and loss of market share any of which would likely harm our business 

a breach of security in our products or computer systems or those of our thirdparty service providers could compromise the integrity of our products harm our reputation create additional liability and adversely impact our financial results 

we have implemented and continue to implement measures intended to maintain the security and integrity of our products source code and computer systems the potential consequences of a security breach or system disruption particularly through cyberattack or cyberintrusion including by computer hackers foreign governments and cyber terrorists have increased in scope as the number intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased despite efforts to create security barriers to such threats it is impossible for us to eliminate this risk in addition we offer cloud services to our customers and some of our products are hosted by thirdparty service providers which expose us to additional risks as those repositories of our customers’ proprietary data may be targeted by such hackers a significant breach of the security andor integrity of our products or systems or those of our thirdparty service providers could prevent our products from functioning properly could enable access to sensitive proprietary or confidential information including that of our customers without authorization or could disrupt our business operations or those of our customers this could require us to incur significant costs of remediation harm our reputation cause customers to stop buying our products and cause us to face lawsuits and potential liability which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

businesses we acquire may not generate the revenue and earnings we anticipate and may otherwise adversely affect our business 

we have acquired and intend to continue to acquire new businesses and technologies if we fail to successfully integrate and manage the businesses and technologies we acquire or if an acquisition does not further our business strategy as we expect our operating results will be adversely affected 

moreover business combinations also involve a number of risks and uncertainties that can adversely affect our operations and operating results including 



 our sales and operations are globally dispersed which exposes us to additional compliance risks which could adversely affect our business and financial results 

we sell and deliver software and services and maintain support operations in a large number of countries whose laws and practices differ from one another and are subject to unexpected changes managing these geographically dispersed operations requires significant attention and resources to ensure compliance with laws of those countries and those of the us governing our activities in nonus countries 

those laws include but are not limited to anticorruption laws and regulations including the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and the uk bribery act 2010 and trade and economic sanctions laws and regulations including laws administered by the us department of the treasury’s office of foreign assets control the us state department the us department of commerce the united nations security council and other relevant sanctions authorities the fcpa and uk bribery act prohibit us and business partners or agents acting on our behalf from offering or providing anything of value to persons considered to be foreign officials under those laws for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business the uk bribery act also prohibits commercial bribery and accepting bribes our compliance risks with these laws are heightened due to the global nature of our business our new gotomarket approach for our iot business that relies heavily on expanding our partner ecosystem the fact that we operate in and are expanding into countries with a higher incidence of corruption and fraudulent business practices than others and the fact that we deal with governments and stateowned business enterprises the employees and representatives of which may be considered foreign officials for purposes of the fcpa and the uk bribery act 

accordingly while we strive to maintain a comprehensive compliance program we cannot guarantee that an employee agent or business partner will not act in violation of our policies or us or other applicable laws investigations of alleged violations of those laws can be expensive and disruptive violations of such laws can lead to civil andor criminal prosecutions substantial fines and other sanctions including the revocation of our rights to continue certain operations and also cause business and reputation loss 

our international businesses present economic and operating risks which could adversely affect our business and financial results 

we expect that our international operations will continue to expand and to account for a significant portion of our total revenue because we transact business in various foreign currencies the volatility of foreign exchange rates has had and may in the future have a material adverse effect on our revenue expenses and operating results 

other risks inherent in our international operations include but are not limited to the following 



 we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights which could adversely affect our business and our ability to compete effectively 

our software products are proprietary we protect our intellectual property rights in these items by relying on copyrights trademarks patents and common law safeguards including trade secret protection as well as restrictions on disclosures and transferability contained in our agreements with other parties despite these measures the laws of all relevant jurisdictions may not afford adequate protection to our products and other intellectual property in addition we frequently encounter attempts by individuals and companies to pirate our software if our measures to protect our intellectual property rights fail others may be able to use those rights which could reduce our competitiveness and revenues 

in addition any legal action to protect our intellectual property rights that we may bring or be engaged in could be costly may distract management from daytoday operations and may lead to additional claims against us and we may not succeed all of which would materially adversely affect our operating results 

intellectual property infringement claims could be asserted against us which could be expensive to defend and could result in limitations on our use of the claimed intellectual property 

the software industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding copyright patent and other intellectual property rights as well as improper disclosure of confidential or proprietary information if a lawsuit of this type is filed it could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel we cannot be sure that we would prevail against any such asserted claims if we did not prevail we could be prevented from using the claimed intellectual property or be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements which might not be available on terms acceptable to us in addition to possible claims with respect to our proprietary products some of our products contain technology developed by and licensed from third parties and we may likewise be susceptible to infringement claims with respect to these thirdparty technologies 

our financial condition could be adversely affected if significant errors or defects are found in our software 

sophisticated software can sometimes contain errors defects or other performance problems if errors or defects are discovered in our products we may need to expend significant financial technical and management resources or divert some of our development resources in order to resolve or work around those defects and we may not be able to correct them in a timely manner or provide an adequate response to our customers 

errors defects or other performance problems in our products could also cause us to lose revenue lose customers and lose market share and could subject us to liability such defects or problems could also damage our business reputation and cause us to lose new business opportunities 

we may have exposure to additional tax liabilities and our effective tax rate may increase or fluctuate which could increase our income tax expense and reduce our net income 

as a multinational organization we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes in the us and in various foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision and other tax liabilities in the ordinary course of a global business there are many intercompany transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain our tax returns are subject to review by various taxing authorities although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes could be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 

our effective tax rate can be adversely affected by several factors many of which are outside of our control including 



 because we have substantial cash requirements in the united states and a significant portion of our cash is generated and held outside of the united states if our cash available in the united states and the cash available under our credit facility is insufficient to meet our operating expenses and debt repayment obligations in the united states we may be required to raise cash in ways that could negatively affect our financial condition results of operations and the market price of our securities 

we have significant operations outside the united states as of september 30 2017 approximately 90 of our cash and cash equivalents balance was held by subsidiaries outside the united states with the remainder of the balance held by the us parent company or its subsidiaries in the united states we believe that the combination of our existing united states cash and cash equivalents future united states operating cash flows and cash available under our credit facility are sufficient to meet our ongoing united states operating expenses and known capital requirements however if these sources of cash are insufficient to meet our future financial obligations in the united states we will be required to seek other available funding sources or repatriate cash to the united states with potentially incremental tax costs which could negatively impact our results of operations financial position and the market price of our securities 

on september 7 2017 ptc entered into a lease for a new worldwide headquarters location in the boston seaport district beginning in january 2019 because our current headquarters lease will not expire until november 2022 our rent obligations for those premises will overlap which could adversely affect our financial condition if we are unable to successfully exit our current headquarters lease or sublease that space 

under our current headquarters lease we pay approximately 74 million in annual base rent plus operating expenses together an annual total of approximately 120 million we will begin paying rent under our new headquarters lease on july 1 2020 our rent under the new lease when we begin paying rent will be an annual base rent amount of 113 million plus our pro rata portions of building operating expenses and real estate taxes approximately 63 of such amounts estimated to be approximately 71 million in 2020 the base rent will increase by 03 million each year over the term of the lease accordingly we will be required to pay rent for both locations from july 1 2020 until november 30 2022 unless we can successfully negotiate to exit our current lease or sublease our current premises we may be unable to negotiate a financially desirable termination of our current lease or to sublease our current premises for an amount at least equal to our rent obligations under the current lease which could adversely affect our cash flow and financial condition   

ii other considerations 

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations as well as our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt 

we have a significant amount of indebtedness as of november 29 2017 our total debt outstanding was approximately 768 million approximately 268 million of which was under our 600 million secured credit facility which matures in september 2019 and 500 million of which was associated with the 6 senior notes issued may 2016 which mature in may 2024 and are unsecured see  liquidity and capital resourcesoutstanding notes  in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this annual report all amounts outstanding under the credit facility and the notes will be due and payable in full on their respective maturity dates as of november 29 2017 we had unused commitments under our credit facility of approximately 319 million ptc inc the parent company and one of our foreign subsidiaries are eligible borrowers under the credit facility and certain other foreign subsidiaries may become borrowers under our credit facility in the future subject to certain conditions 

notwithstanding the limits contained in the credit agreement governing our credit facility and the indenture governing our 2024 6 notes we may be able to incur substantial additional debt from time to time to finance working capital capital expenditures investments or acquisitions or for other purposes if we do so the risks related to our high level of debt could intensify specifically our high level of debt could 

 any of the abovelisted factors could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt agreements 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness which may not be successful 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business legislative regulatory and other factors some of which are beyond our control we may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness 

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness we may not be able to effect any such alternative measures if necessary on commercially reasonable terms or at all and even if successful those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations our debt agreements restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due 

our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all would materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations and our ability to satisfy our debt obligations 

if we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt we will be in default and the lenders under our credit facility could terminate their commitments to loan money the lenders could foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings the holders of our 2024 6 notes could declare all outstanding principal premium if any and interest to be due and payable and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation all of these events could result in a loss of your investment 

we are required to comply with certain financial and operating covenants under our debt agreements any failure to comply with those covenants could cause amounts borrowed to become immediately due and payable andor prevent us from borrowing under the credit facility 

we are required to comply with specified financial and operating covenants under our debt agreements and to make payments under our debt which limit our ability to operate our business as we otherwise might operate it our failure to comply with any of these covenants or to meet any debt 

payment obligations could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived would result in any amounts outstanding including any accrued interest andor unpaid fees becoming immediately due and payable we might not have sufficient working capital or liquidity to satisfy any repayment obligations in the event of an acceleration of those obligations in addition if we are not in compliance with the financial and operating covenants under the credit facility at the time we wish to borrow funds we will be unable to borrow funds 

in addition the financial and operating covenants under the credit facility may limit our ability to borrow funds including for strategic acquisitions and share repurchases 

we may be unable to meet our goal of returning 40 of free cash flow to shareholders through share repurchases which could decrease your expected return on investment in ptc stock 

our capital allocation strategy includes a longterm goal of returning approximately 40 of free cash flow cash flow from operations less capital expenditures to shareholders through share repurchases meeting this goal requires us to generate consistent free cash flow and have available capital in the years ahead in an amount sufficient to enable us to continue investing in organic and inorganic growth as well as to return a significant portion of the cash generated to stockholders in the form of share repurchases we may not meet this goal if we do not generate the free cash flow we expect if we use our available cash to satisfy other priorities if we have insufficient funds available to make such repurchases or if we are unable to borrow funds under our credit facility to make such repurchases for example covenant limitations under our credit facility specifically our leverage ratio as a result of lower earnings due to our subscription transition limited our ability to repurchase shares in 2017 and 2016 

additionally our cash flow fluctuates over the course of the year and over multiple years so although our goal is to return 40 of free cash flow to shareholders that is an average over a longer term and the number of shares repurchased and amount of free cash flow returned in any given period will vary and may be more or less than 40 in any such period finally the number of shares repurchased for a given amount of cash will vary based on ptc’s stock price so the number of shares repurchased will not be a consistent or predictable number or percentage of outstanding stock 

our stock price has been volatile which may make it harder to resell shares at a favorable time and price 

market prices for securities of software companies are generally volatile and are subject to significant fluctuations that may be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies the trading prices and valuations of these stocks and of ours may not be predictable negative changes in the public’s perception of the prospects of software companies or of ptc or the markets we serve could depress our stock price regardless of our operating results 

also a large percentage of our common stock is held by institutional investors purchases and sales of our common stock by these institutional investors could have a significant impact on the market price of the stock for more information about those investors please see our proxy statement with respect to our most recent annual meeting of stockholders and schedules 13d and 13g filed with the sec with respect to our common stock 

our 2024 6 notes are not listed on any national securities exchange or included in any automated quotation system which could make it harder to resell the notes at a favorable time and price 

our 2024 6 notes are not listed on any national securities exchange or included in any automated quotation system as a result an active market for the notes may not exist or be maintained which would adversely affect the market price and liquidity of the notes in that case holders may not be able to sell their notes at a particular time or at a favorable price 

the market for noninvestment grade debt historically has been subject to severe disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the notes the market if any for the notes may experience similar disruptions and any such disruptions may adversely affect the liquidity in that market or the prices at which the notes may be sold

forwardlooking statements 

statements in this annual report about anticipated financial results and growth as well as about the development of our products and markets are forwardlooking statements that are based on our current plans and assumptions important information about the bases for these plans and assumptions and factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements is contained below and in item 1a “risk factors” of this annual report 

information about our financial reporting 

we use certain operating measures including our subscription measures and nongaap financial measures when discussing our business and results we discuss these measures how we use them and how they are calculated in “subscription measures” and “nongaap financial measures” below 

unless otherwise indicated all references to a year reflect our fiscal year that ends on september 30 

executive overview 

we executed well across our key strategic and operational objectives in 2017 bookings grew year over year reflecting broadbased strength across our iot cad and plm businesses and strength in europe the americas and our global channel our subscription transition initiative also progressed well throughout 2017 with subscription bookings constituting 69 of all software license bookings for the year and subscription revenue up 136 over 2016 finally we improved our operating margins over 2016 despite a higher than expected subscription mix for the year 



the increase in total revenue and subscription revenue reflects our exit from the trough in revenue and eps growth that occurs when transitioning from a perpetual to subscription business model as our mix of subscription sales relative to perpetual license sales has increased perpetual license revenue and support revenue have declined additionally professional services revenue has declined in accordance with our strategy to migrate more services engagements to our partners and to deliver products that require less consulting and training services 

license and subscription bookings grew 4 in 2017 over 2016 to 419 million and grew 21 over 2015 excluding a 20 million slm mega deal from the fourth quarter of 2016 license and subscription bookings grew 10 in 2017 over 2016 

the increase in subscription revenue relative to perpetual license revenue has resulted in an increase in our recurring software revenue with approximately 73 of our total revenue in 2017 from recurring software revenue streams compared to 68 in 2016 and 59 in 2015 annualized recurring revenue   was approximat ely 905 m illion as of the fourth quarter of 2017 an increase of 12 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 



gaap and nongaap operating income in 2017 reflect an increase in gross margin associated with higher revenue and a lower mix of professional services revenue which has lower margins than our software revenue partially offset by higher costs associated with our cloud services revenue additionally operating margin improved due to lower restructuring charges in 2017 which were 683 million lower in 2017 compared to 2016 

our gaap and nongaap earnings reflect an additional 125 million in interest expense due to our 2016 issuance of 500 million of 60 senior unsecured longterm notes and a higher gaap and nongaap tax rate in 2017 compared to 2016   

we ended 2017 with cash cash equivalents and marketable securities of 330 million up from 328 million at the end of 2016 we generated 135 million  of cash from operations in 2017 which included 37 million of restructuring payments and a 3 million legal settlement payment we used cash from operations to repurchase 51 million of common stock and to repay 40 million  of borrowings under our credit facility in 2017 at september 30 2017 the balance outstanding under our credit facility was 218 million and total debt outstanding was 718 million 

future expectations strategies and risks   

our transition to a subscription model has been a headwind for revenue and earnings in 2017 the effect of which is moderating as the subscription business matures and we exit the subscription trough a 

higher mix of subscription bookings is expected to benefit us over the long term but results in lower revenue and lower earnings in the near term 

our results have been impacted and we expect will continue to be impacted by our ability to close large transactions the amount of bookings and revenue particularly license and subscriptions attributable to large transactions and the number of such transactions may vary significantly from quarter to quarter based on customer purchasing decisions and macroeconomic conditions such transactions may have long lead times as they often follow a lengthy product selection and evaluation process and for existing customers are influenced by contract expiration cycles this may cause volatility in our results 

as we move into 2018 our three overriding goals continue to be

the following table shows the financial measures that we consider the most significant indicators of the performance of our business in addition to providing operating income operating margin and diluted earnings per share as calculated under generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” it shows nongaap operating income nongaap operating margin and nongaap diluted earnings per share for the reported periods these nongaap financial measures exclude fair value adjustments related to acquired deferred revenue acquired deferred costs stockbased compensation expense amortization of acquired intangible assets expense acquisitionrelated and pension plan termination costs restructuring charges certain identified gains or charges included in nonoperating other income expense and the related tax effects of the preceding items as well as the tax items identified these nongaap financial measures provide investors another view of our operating results that is aligned with management budgets and with performance criteria in our incentive compensation plans management uses and investors should use nongaap financial measures in conjunction with our gaap results 



  



187 million  related to the reversal of a portion of the us valuation allowance related to reducing deferred tax assets in connection with settling the us pension plan 

subscription measures 

given the difference in revenue recognition between the sale of a perpetual software license revenue is recognized at the time of sale and a subscription revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription term we use bookings for internal planning forecasting and reporting of new license and subscription sales and cloud services transactions 

bookings 

in order to normalize between perpetual and subscription licenses we define subscription bookings  as the subscription annualized contract value subscription acv of new subscription bookings multiplied by a conversion factor of 2 we arrived at the conversion factor of 2 by considering a number of variables including pricing support length of term and renewal rates in 2017 2016 and 2015 the average subscription contract term was approximately two years 

we define subscription acv  as the total value of a new subscription booking divided by the term of the contract in days multiplied by 365 if the term of the subscription contract is less than a year the acv is equal to the total contract value 

s ubscription acv increased 25 over 2016 to 143 million due to continued adoption of our subscription offerings around the globe 

we define  license and subscription bookings  as subscriptions bookings as defined above plus perpetual license bookings during the period 

license and subscription bookings for 2017 were 419 million up 4 over 2016 excluding a 20 million booking from a megadeal in 2016 bookings increased 10 over 2016 cad and plm bookings grew 14 and 6 respectively for the full year and our iot bookings grew above the market growth rate of 3040 organically and in total 

because subscription bookings is a metric we use to approximate the value of subscription sales if sold as perpetual licenses it does not represent the actual revenue that will be recognized with respect to subscription sales or that would be recognized if the sales had been perpetual licenses 

we believe that over time the revenue from these contracts will exceed the initial booking value as we expect customers will renew their subscriptions for more than two years and will expand their subscriptions as well 

annualized recurring revenue arr 

annualized recurring revenue arr for a given period is calculated by dividing the nongaap subscription and support software revenue for the period by the number of days in the period and multiplying by 365 arr should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue as it is an operating measure and is not intended to be combined with or to replace either of those items arr is not a forecast and does not include perpetual license or professional services revenues 

arr was approximat ely 905 m illion as of the fourth quarter of 2017 which increased 12 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 

impact of foreign currency exchange on results of operations 

approximately two thirds of our revenue and half of our expenses are transacted in currencies other than the us dollar currency translation affects our reported results which are in us dollars changes in currency exchange rates particularly for the yen and the euro compared to the prior year decreased revenue and decreased expenses in 2017 and 2016 if actual reported results were converted into us dollars based on the corresponding prior year’s foreign currency exchange rates 2017 and 2016 revenue would have been higher by 10 million and 244 million respectively and expenses would have been higher by 30 million and 241 million respectively the net impact on yearoveryear results would have been a decrease in operating income of 20 million in 2017 and an increase in operating income of 03 million in 2016 the results of operations revenue by line of business and revenue by geographic region in the tables that follow present both actual percentage changes year over year and percentage changes on a constant currency basis 

acquisitions 

there were no significant acquisitions in 2017 in 2017 we had a full year of revenue for kepware which we acquired on january 12 2016 kepware contributed 161 million to 2016 revenue in 2016 we also acquired vuforia on november 3 2015 and in 2015 we acquired coldlight on may 7 2015 prior to their acquisitions vuforia and coldlight revenues were not material 

reclassifications 

effective with the beginning of the third quarter of 2017 we report cost of license and subscription revenue separately from cost of support revenue and are presenting cost of revenue in three  categories 1 cost of license and subscription revenue 2 cost of support revenue and 3 cost of professional services revenue the discussion that follows reflects our revised reporting structure 

deferred revenue and backlog unbilled deferred revenue 

deferred revenue primarily relates to software agreements invoiced to customers for which the revenue has not yet been recognized unbilled deferred revenue backlog consists of contractually committed orders for license subscription and support with a customer for which the customer has not yet been invoiced and the associated revenue has not been recognized we do not record unbilled deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheet until we invoice the customer 

  



of the unbilled deferred revenue balance at september 30 2017 we expect to invoice customers approximately 355 million within the next twelve months unbilled deferred revenue grew 72 yearoveryear due to the high volume of new subscription bookings in the fourth quarter of 2017 with a billing and subscription start date of october 1 2017 or later which are booked in the quarter when the order is received if the start date is less than 100 days from the end of the quarter and a large number of subscription renewals with billing renewal dates of october 1 2017 or later in accordance with the 100 day booking rule as well as the second or third year billing of multiyear subscription contracts many of our subscription bookings are for multiple years and are typically billed annually at the start of each 

annual subscription period the average contract duration was approximately 2 years for new subscription contracts in 2017 and 2016 

we expect that the amount of deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue will fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to the specific timing duration and size of customer subscription and support agreements varying billing cycles of such agreements the specific timing of customer renewals foreign currency fluctuations the timing of when deferred revenue is recognized as revenue and the timing of our fiscal quarter ends 

revenue 

revenue is reported below by line of business subscription support perpetual license and professional services by product area solutions and iot groups and by geographic region americas europe asia pacific results include combined revenue from direct sales and our channel 

revenue by line of business 

revenue by group 



software revenue performance 

software revenue consists of subscription support and perpetual license revenue subscription revenue is comprised of timebased licenses whereby customers use our software and receive related 

support for a specified term and for which revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the contract support revenue is composed of contracts to maintain new andor previously purchased perpetual licenses for which revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the contract perpetual licenses include a perpetual right to use the software for which revenue is generally recognized up front upon delivery to the customer 

solutions group 

 software revenue returned to growth in 2017 after a trough in 2016 as the subscription model transition accelerated customers purchased fewer perpetual licenses and associated support and some existing support contracts converted to subscriptions the strength in our solutions business was driven by our cad and core plm businesses cad delivered 14 bookings growth for the full year well above estimated market growth rates our cad business has now delivered two consecutive years of doubledigit constant currency bookings growth creo growth has benefited from our gotomarket improvement initiatives evidenced by seven consecutive quarters of doubledigit bookings growth in our reseller channel in core plm fullyear bookings grew 6 which is in line with estimated market growth rates plm continues to benefit from sales of thingworx navigate for which we closed transactions across a variety of vertical markets and which we believe presents an opportunity to drive continued plm growth we also closed several major strategic plm deals in the americas and europe growth in cad and plm was offset by a significant decline in slm bookings our slm business is characterized by low volume high dollar transactions and we have experienced volatility period to period in this business 

the decline in software revenue in 2016 compared to 2015 was driven primarily by a higher mix of subscription bookings as well as foreign currency rate changes and macroeconomic conditions 

iot group 

the iot group delivered revenue growth in 2017 and 2016 in 2017 software revenue growth was driven by continued adoption of our iot solutions with iot bookings growing above estimated market rates of 30 to 40 for the fiscal year partially offset by higher subscription mix iot bookings continue to come from a wide variety of vertical markets and use cases led by the industrial factory operations in 2017 customer expansions comprised approximately 70 of thingworx bookings 

 additionally kepware which we acquired on january 12 2016 contributed to iot revenue growth from 2015 to 2016 with 161 million of revenue in 2016 and to a lesser extent in 2017 which included a full year of kepware revenue 

professional services revenue 

consulting and training services engagements typically result from sales of new perpetual licenses and subscriptions particularly of our plm and slm solutions the decline in professional services revenue in 2017 and 2016 was due in part to strong growth in bookings by our service partners which is in line with our strategy for professional services revenue to trend flattodown over time as we e xpand our service partner program under which service engagements are referred to third party service providers additionally over time we anticipate offering solutions that require less service as a result we do not expect that professional services revenue will increase proportionately with software revenue foreign currency exchange rates impacted services revenue positively by 05 million in 2017 and negatively by 59 million in 2016 

revenue by geographic region 

  



a significant percentage of our annual revenue comes from large customers in the broader manufacturing space as a result software revenue growth in our core cad and plm products historically has correlated to growth in broader measures of the global manufacturing economy including gdp industrial production and manufacturing pmi 

the increase in revenue in 2017 compared to 2016 was driven by our exit from the subscription trough coupled with strong new bookings performance despite a 1300 basis point increase in our subscription mix to 69 in 2017 europe and americas were strong with fullyear bookings growth of 29 28 on a constant currency basis in europe and flat in the americas up 15 excluding the 20 million mega deal from the fourth quarter of 2016 asia pacific bookings were down 16 in 2017 compared to 2016 16 decline on a constant currency basis primarily due to japan which was down 42 we believe that the decline in japan is due primarily to sales execution issues which we are addressing 

the decrease in revenue in 2016 compared to 2015 was driven primarily by a higher mix of subscription bookings as well as the impact of currency movements on reported revenue particularly the euro and the yen 

americas 

the increase in revenue in the americas in 2017 compared to 2016 was due to strong bookings offset by a higher subscription mix the increase in revenue in the americas in 2017 compared to 2016 consisted of an increase in subscription revenue of 126 offset by decreases of 33 15 and 8 in perpetual license revenue support revenue and professional services revenue respectively 

the decrease in revenue in the americas in 2016 compared to 2015 consisted of decreases of 39 24 and 3 in perpetual license revenue professional services revenue and support revenue primarily plm respectively partially offset by an increase in subscription revenue of 58 

europe 

the increase in revenue in europe in 2017 compared to 2016 was due to the strong bookings partially offset by a higher subscription mix the increase in revenue in europe in 2017 compared to 2016 consisted of an increase of 139 in subscription revenue offset by decreases of 17 in perpetual license revenue 11 in professional services revenue and 10 in support revenue currency did not have a material impact on revenue in 2017 relative to 2016 

the decrease in revenue in europe in 2016 compared to 2015 consisted of decreases in perpetual license revenue of 46 43 on a constant currency basis and in support revenue of 6 1 on a constant currency basis partially offset by an increase in subscription revenue of 84 91 on a constant currency basis 

yearoveryear changes in foreign currency exchange rates particularly the euro unfavorably impacted european revenue by 39 million and 213 million in 2017 and 2016 respectively 

asia pacific 

asia pacific revenue in 2017 compared to 2016 was flat primarily due to a higher subscription mix and in part due to sales execution challenges in japan asia pacific bookings declined 16 on a constant currency basis in 2017 compared to 2016 although below historical bookings we saw some progress in japan in the fourth quarter of 2017 with bookings growth of 80 sequentially to approximately 8 million 

in 2017 compared to 2016 subscription revenue increased by 178 offset by decreases in perpetual license revenue of 20 in professional services revenue of 13 and in support revenue of 6 currency did not have a material effect on revenue in 2017 relative to 2016 

the decrease in revenue in asia pacific in 2016 compared to 2015 consisted of decreases in perpetual license revenue of 31 29 on a constant currency basis in professional services revenue of 10 10 on a constant currency basis and in support revenue of 4 4 on a constant currency basis partially offset by an increase in subscription revenue of 414 374 on a constant currency basis 

yearoveryear changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted revenue by 16 million in 2017 and unfavorably by 02 million in 2016 

gross margin 



the increase in total gross margin in 2017 compared to 2016 is in line with total revenue growth total revenue in 2017 grew 2 over 2016 margins for license and subscription are beginning to expand as the subscription model matures and revenue that has been deferred begins to contribute to current periods support gross margins are down for 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to the 12 decrease in support revenue associated with an increase in our subscription mix and the conversion of existing customers from support contracts to subscription support revenue comprised 49  of our total revenue in 2017 compared to 57  in 2016 and 54  in 2015 

gross margin as a percentage of total revenue in 2016 compared to 2015 reflects lower software margins due to lower perpetual license revenue as a result of the acceleration of our subscription transition

our cost of license and subscription includes cost of license which consists of fixed and variable costs associated with reproducing and distributing software and documentation as well as royalties paid to third parties for technology embedded in or licensed with our software products and amortization of intangible assets associated with acquired products and cost of subscription which includes our cost of cloud services and software as a service revenue including hosting fees costs associated with providing postcontract support such as providing software updates and technical support for both our subscription offerings and our perpetual licenses are included in cost of support revenue cost of license and subscription revenue as a percent of license and subscription revenue can vary depending on the subscription mix percentage the product mix sold the effect of fixed and variable royalties headcount and the level of amortization of acquired software intangible assets 

costs in 2017 compared to 2016 increased primarily as a result of a 150 million increase in total compensation benefit and travel expense due to increased headcount primarily associated with supporting our cloud products and a 34 million increase in cloud services hosting costs 

costs in 2016 compared to 2015 increased primarily as a result of a 52 million increase in total compensation benefit and travel expense due to increased headcount a 49 million increase in cloud services hosting costs and 19 million increase in amortization of acquired purchase software 

cost of support revenue 



cost of support revenue consists of costs such as salaries benefits and computer equipment and facilities associated with customer support and the release of support updates including related royalty costs associated with providing support for both our perpetual licenses and subscription licenses 

costs and expense in 2017 compared to 2016 increased primarily due to an increase of 31 million 5 in total compensation benefit and travel costs 

costs and expense in 2016 compared to 2015 increased primarily due to an increase of 30 million 5 in total compensation benefit and travel costs 

cost of professional services revenue 



our cost of professional services revenue includes costs such as salaries benefits information technology costs and facilities expenses for our training and consulting personnel and thirdparty subcontractor fees 

in 2017 compared to 2016 total compensation benefit costs and travel expenses decreased by 188 million the cost of thirdparty consulting services was 47 million lower in 2017 compared to 2016 

in 2016 compared to 2015 total compensation benefit costs and travel expenses decreased by 248 million the cost of thirdparty consulting services was 26 million lower in 2016 compared to 2015 

as a result of decreases in professional services revenue in 2017 2016 and 2015 we have reduced headcount resulting in lower compensationrelated costs the decreases in 2017 and 2016 compared to the prior years in the cost of thirdparty consulting services is a result of our strategy to have our strategic services partners perform services for customers directly which has decreased revenue and improved services margins 

sales and marketing 

our sales and marketing expenses primarily include salaries and benefits sales commissions advertising and marketing programs travel information technology costs and facility expenses 

in 2017 compared to 2016 event costs increased 31 million due to our liveworx event held in may 2017 our compensation benefits and travel costs were 35 million lower in 2017 compared to 2016 

primarily due to lower commissions which were higher in 2016 as a result of significantly higher than planned subscription bookings 

our compensation benefit costs and travel expenses were higher by an aggregate of 5 144 million in 2016 compared to 2015 which reflects lower salaries offset by higher incentivebased compensation including commissions due primarily to higher than anticipated subscription bookings and increased headcount 

research and development 



our research and development expenses consist principally of salaries and benefits information technology costs and facility expenses major research and development activities include developing new releases and updates of our software that enhance functionality and add features 

in 2017 compared to 2016 total compensation benefit and travel expenses were higher by 3 50 million due to an increase in headcount and a 16 million increase in cloud services hosting costs as some product testing has moved to a cloud environment the percentage increase in headcount is greater than the percentage increase in total compensation costs due to a shift in headcount to lower cost geographies 

total compensation benefit costs and travel expenses were higher by 2 43 million in 2016 compared to 2015 the decrease in research and development headcount from 2015 to 2016 reflects restructuring actions offset by approximately 132 employees added from businesses acquired since the second quarter of 2015 

general and administrative ga 



our ga expenses include the costs of our corporate finance information technology human resources legal and administrative functions as well as acquisitionrelated charges bad debt expense and outside professional services including accounting and legal fees acquisitionrelated costs include direct costs of acquisitions and expenses related to acquisition integration activities including transaction fees due diligence costs retention bonuses and severance and professional fees including legal and accounting costs related to the acquisition in addition subsequent adjustments to our initial estimated amount of contingent consideration associated with specific acquisitions are included in acquisitionrelated charges 

in 2017 compared to 2016 total compensation benefit and travel cost increased by 70 million primarily because of merit increases and increased severance costs as well as higher stockbased compensation due to a higher attainment of performancebased awards an award modification and the launch of the employee stock purchase plan espp in the fourth quarter of 2016 offsetting the increases acquisitionrelated charges decreased 49 million because there were no significant acquisitions in the year and tax and audit fees decreased 18 million during the year 

the decrease in overall general and administrative costs in 2016 compared to 2015 was due primarily to a 282 million accrual recorded in 2015 related to the settlement of an investigation in china partially offset by an increase in performancebased bonus and stockbased compensation of 237 million due in part to a modification of performancebased awards previously granted under our longterm incentive programs 

us pension settlement loss 

us pension settlement loss reflects the loss recognized in the fourth quarter of 2015 related to the termination of our us pension plan due to the amortization of actuarial losses previously recorded in equity 

amortization of acquired intangible assets 



amortization of acquired intangible assets reflects the amortization of acquired nonproduct related intangible assets primarily customer and trademarkrelated intangible assets recorded in connection with completed acquisitions amortization of intangible assets typically follows the economic benefit pattern of the acquired intangible assets 

the decrease in amortization of acquired intangible assets from 2015 to 2016 is due to certain intangibles becoming fully amortized partially offset by an increase in amortization related to recent acquisitions 

restructuring charges   



restructuring charges for 2017 were 79 million including 56 million of facility related charges and 24 million of employee terminationrelated costs as of september 30 2017 we were materially complete with the restructuring actions and had incurred total restructuring charges of approximately 842 million the cost savings associated with our 2017 and 2016 restructuring actions were largely offset by planned cost increases and investments in our business 

restructuring charges for 2016 were 763 million 771 million related to the plan announced in october 2015 described below offset by a 08 million credit related to prior year restructuring actions 

the charge of 771 million in 2016 included 13 million of facility related charges and 758 million of employee related termination costs primarily related to termination benefits associated with approximately 800 employees 

our 2015 restructuring was undertaken to enable us to increase investment in our iot business and to reduce our cost structure through organizational efficiencies in the face of significant foreign currency depreciation relative to the us dollar and a more cautious outlook on global macroeconomic conditions the restructuring actions resulted in charges of 434 million during 2015 including 14 million of facility related charges and 420 million of employeerelated termination costs primarily related to termination benefits associated with 411 employees this reorganization resulted in net annualized expense reductions of approximately 30 million 

in 2017 2016 and 2015 we made cash payments related to restructuring charges of 371 million 550 million and 536 million respectively at september 30 2017 accrued expenses for unpaid 

restructuring charges totaled 62 million of which we expect to pay 41 million within the next twelve months 

interest expense 

the increase in interest expense in 2017 compared to 2016 was due to a full year of interest being incurred on the 500 million 6 senior notes the 2024 6 notes which were issued in the third quarter of 2016 and higher average interest rates on our revolving credit facility in 2017 compared to 2016 

the increase in interest expense in 2016 compared to 2015 was due to higher amounts outstanding under our credit facility and the issuance of the 2024 6 notes we had 758 million total debt at september 30 2016 compared to 668 million at september 30 2015 we used the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2024 6 notes to repay a portion of our outstanding revolving loan under our credit facility because the interest rate on the notes is higher than the variable rate we paid under our credit facility our annual interest expense has increased 

the average interest rate on our total borrowings was 49  in 2017 30  in 2016 and 17  in 2015 

interest income and other expense net 



foreign currency net losses include costs of hedging contracts certain realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains or losses and foreign exchange gains or losses resulting from the required periodend currency remeasurement of the assets and liabilities of our subsidiaries that use the us dollar as their functional currency because a large portion of our revenue and expenses is transacted in foreign currencies we engage in hedging transactions involving the use of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates changes in the balance year over year are due to required periodend currency remeasurement of the assets and liabilities of our subsidiaries that use the us dollar as their functional currency hedging costs increased 13 million in 2017 compared to 2016 

interest income represents earnings on the investment of our available cash balances and interest on financing provided to customers as described in note b summary of significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report 

other income expense net is primarily made up other nonoperating gains and losses in january 2017 we sold a cost method investment for a gain of 37 million 

income taxes 

tax provision and effective income tax rate 



in 2017 and 2016 our effective tax rate was materially impacted by our corporate structure in which our foreign taxes are at an effective tax rate lower than the us a significant amount of our foreign earnings is generated by our subsidiaries organized in ireland in 2017 2016 and 2015 the foreign rate differential predominantly relates to these irish earnings additionally we have a full valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in the us primarily related to net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards as a result we have not recorded a benefit related to ongoing us losses our foreign rate differential in 2017 2016 and 2015 includes the continuing rate benefit from a business realignment completed on september 30 2014 in which intellectual property was transferred between two whollyowned foreign subsidiaries the realignment allows us to more efficiently manage the distribution of our products to european customers in 2017 and 2016 this realignment resulted in a tax benefit of approximately 28 million each year and a benefit of 24 million in 2015 in 2017 and 2016 we released valuation allowances in certain foreign subsidiaries and recorded benefits of 90 and 31 million respectively also in 2017 we recorded a tax benefit of 35 million related to the release of a tax reserve upon completion of a favorable agreement with tax authorities in a foreign jurisdiction 

additionally in 2015 us permanent items include the tax effect of a 145 million expense related to the settlement of an investigation in china other factors that impacted the 2015 effective tax rate included the release of a valuation allowance totaling 187 million  relating to the us pension plan termination foreign withholding taxes of 38 million  a tax benefit of 31 million  relating to the reassessment of our reserve requirements and a benefit of 14 million  in conjunction with the reorganization of our atego us subsidiaries 

valuation allowance 

we have concluded based on the weight of available evidence that a full valuation allowance continues to be required against our us net deferred tax assets as they are not more likely than not to be realized in the future we will continue to reassess our valuation allowance requirements each financial reporting period 

tax audits and examinations 

in the normal course of business ptc and its subsidiaries are examined by various taxing authorities including the internal revenue service irs in the u s we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate we are currently under audit by tax authorities in several jurisdictions audits by tax authorities typically involve examination of the deductibility of certain permanent items transfer pricing limitations on net operating losses and tax credits although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in material changes in our estimates 

our future effective income tax rate 

our future effective income tax rate may be materially impacted by the amount of income taxes associated with our foreign earnings which are taxed at rates different from the us federal statutory income tax rate as well as the timing and extent of the realization of deferred tax assets and changes in the tax law further our tax rate may fluctuate within a fiscal year including from quarter to quarter due to items arising from discrete events including settlements of tax audits and assessments the resolution or identification of tax position uncertainties and acquisitions of other companies 

nongaap financial measures 

the nongaap financial measures presented in the discussion of our results of operations and the respective most directly comparable gaap measures are 

 the nongaap financial measures exclude fair value adjustments related to acquired deferred revenue and deferred costs stockbased compensation expense amortization of acquired intangible assets expense acquisitionrelated charges pension plan terminationrelated costs a legal settlement 

accrual restructuring charges nonoperating credit facility refinancing costs identified discrete charges included in nonoperating other expense net and the related tax effects of the preceding items and any other identified tax items 

these items are normally included in the comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with gaap our management excludes these items when evaluating our ongoing performance andor predicting our earnings trends and therefore excludes them when presenting nongaap financial measures management uses nongaap financial measures in conjunction with our gaap results as should investors 

fair value of acquired deferred revenue is a purchase accounting adjustment recorded to reduce acquired deferred revenue to the fair value of the remaining obligation so our gaap revenue after an acquisition does not reflect the full amount of revenue that would have been reported if the acquired deferred revenue was not written down to fair value we believe excluding these adjustments to revenue from these contracts and associated costs in fair value adjustment to deferred services cost  is useful to investors as an additional means to assess revenue trends of our business    

stockbased compensation is a noncash expense relating to stockbased awards issued to executive officers employees and outside directors consisting of restricted stock stock options and restricted stock units we exclude this expense as it is a noncash expense and we assess our internal operations excluding this expense and believe it facilitates comparisons to the performance of other companies in our industry 

amortization of acquired intangible assets is a noncash expense that is impacted by the timing and magnitude of our acquisitions we believe the assessment of our operations excluding these costs is relevant to our assessment of internal operations and comparisons to the performance of other companies in our industry 

acquisitionrelated charges included in general and administrative costs are   direct costs of potential and completed acquisitions and expenses related to acquisition integration activities including transaction fees due diligence costs severance and professional fees in addition subsequent adjustments to our initial estimated amount of contingent consideration associated with specific acquisitions are also included within acquisitionrelated charges the occurrence and amount of these costs will vary depending on the timing and size of acquisitions 

us pension plan terminationrelated costs include charges related to our plan that we began terminating in the second quarter of 2014 costs associated with termination of the plan are not considered part of our regular operations 

legal accrual includes amounts accrued to settle our sec and doj fcpa investigation in china which was ultimately settled and paid in the second quarter of 2016 for 282 million and other amounts in respect of related regulatory and other matters we view these matters as nonordinary course events and exclude the amounts when reviewing our operating performance 

restructuring charges include severance costs and excess facility restructuring charges resulting from reductions of personnel driven by modifications to our business strategy these costs may vary in size based on our restructuring plan 

nonoperating credit facility refinancing costs  are nonoperating charges we record as a result of the refinancing of our credit facility we assess our internal operations excluding these costs and believe it facilitates comparisons to the performance of other companies in our industry 

income tax adjustments include the tax impact of the items above and assumes that we are profitable on a nongaap basis in the us and one foreign jurisdiction and eliminates the effect of the valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets in those jurisdictions additionally we exclude other material tax items that we view as nonordinary course 

we use these nongaap financial measures and we believe that they assist our investors to make periodtoperiod comparisons of our operational performance because they provide a view of our operating results without items that are not in our view indicative of our core operating results we believe that these nongaap financial measures help illustrate underlying trends in our business and we use the measures to establish budgets and operational goals communicated internally and externally for managing our business and evaluating our performance we believe that providing nongaap financial measures affords investors a view of our operating results that may be more easily compared to the results of peer companies 

the items excluded from the nongaap financial measures often have a material impact on our financial results and such items often recur accordingly the nongaap financial measures included in this annual report should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for or superior to the comparable measures prepared in accordance with gaap the following tables reconcile each of these nongaap financial measures to its most closely comparable gaap measure on our financial statements 





  



critical accounting policies and estimates 

we have prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america in preparing our financial statements we make estimates assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our reported revenues results of operations and net income as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet these estimates assumptions and judgments are made based on our historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances these estimates may change as new events occur or additional information is obtained and we may periodically be faced with uncertainties the outcomes of which are not within our control and may not be known for a prolonged period of time 

the accounting policies methods and estimates used to prepare our financial statements are described generally in note b summary of significant accounting policies  of “notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report the most important accounting judgments and estimates that we made in preparing the financial statements involved 



 a critical accounting policy is one that is both material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires us to make subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies require us to make assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time of the estimate and different estimates that we could have used or changes in the estimates that are reasonably likely to occur may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process actual results could differ from those estimates 

accounting policies guidelines and interpretations related to our critical accounting policies and estimates are generally subject to numerous sources of authoritative guidance and are often reexamined by accounting standards rule makers and regulators these rule makers andor regulators may promulgate interpretations guidance or regulations that may result in changes to our accounting policies which could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 

revenue recognition 

our sources of revenue include 1 subscription 2 support 3 perpetual license and 4 professional services we record revenues for software related deliverables in accordance with the guidance provided by asc 985605 softwarerevenue recognition and revenues for nonsoftware deliverables in accordance with   asc 60525  revenue recognition multipleelement arrangements when the following criteria are met 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 2 delivery has occurred generally fob shipping point or electronic distribution 3 the fee is fixed or determinable and 4 collection is probable we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with determining the amounts of software license and services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period our primary judgments involve the following 

 our software is distributed primarily through our direct sales force in addition we have an indirect distribution channel through alliances with resellers revenue arrangements with resellers are generally recognized on a sellthrough basis that is when we deliver the product to the enduser customer we record consideration given to a reseller as a reduction of revenue to the extent we have recorded revenue from the reseller we do not offer contractual rights of return stock balancing or price protection to our resellers and actual product returns from them have been insignificant to date as a result we do not maintain reserves for reseller product returns 

at the time of each sale transaction we must make an assessment of the collectability of the amount due from the customer revenue is only recognized at that time if management deems that collection is probable in making this assessment we consider customer creditworthiness and historical payment experience at that same time we assess whether fees are fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties in assessing whether the fee is fixed or determinable we consider the payment terms of the transaction including transactions with payment terms that extend beyond our customary payment terms and our collection experience in similar transactions without making concessions among other factors we have periodically provided financing to creditworthy customers with payment terms up to 24  months if the fee is determined not to be fixed or determinable revenue is recognized only as payments become due from the customer provided that all other revenue recognition criteria are met our software license arrangements generally do not include customer acceptance provisions however if an arrangement includes an acceptance provision we record 

revenue only upon the earlier of 1 receipt of written acceptance from the customer or 2 expiration of the acceptance period 

generally our contracts are accounted for individually however when contracts are closely interrelated and dependent on each other it may be necessary to account for two or more contracts as one to reflect the substance of the group of contracts 

subscription 

subscription revenue includes revenue from two primary sources 1 subscriptionbased licenses and 2 cloud services 

subscriptionbased licenses include the right for a customer to use our licenses and receive related support for a specified term and revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement since we do not have vsoe of fair value for our coterminous support when sold in arrangements with other elements vsoe of fair value is established for the subscriptionbased licenses through the use of a substantive renewal clause within the customer contract for a combined annual fee that includes the termbased license and related support 

cloud services revenue which in 2017 2016 and 2015 represented less than 5  of our total revenue includes fees for hosting and application management of customers’ perpetual or subscriptionbased licenses hosting services and fees for software as a service saas arrangements generally customers have the right to terminate a hosting services contract and take possession of the licenses without a significant penalty when hosting services are sold as part of a multielement transaction revenue is allocated to hosting services based on vsoe and recognized ratably over the contractual term beginning on the commencement dates of each contract which is the date the services are made available to the customer vsoe is established for hosting services either through a substantive stated renewal option or stated contractual overage rates as these rates represent the value the customer is willing to pay on a standalone basis we also offer cloud services under saas arrangements whereby customers access our software in the cloud under saas arrangements customers are not entitled to terminate the cloud services and cannot take possession of the software cloud services include setup fees which are recognized ratably over the contract term or the expected customer life whichever is longer 

support 

support contracts generally include rights to unspecified upgrades when and if available telephone and internetbased support updates and bug fixes support revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the support contract on a straightline basis 

perpetual license 

under perpetual license arrangements we generally recognize license revenue up front upon shipment to the customer we use the residual method to recognize revenue from perpetual license software arrangements that include one or more elements to be delivered at a future date when evidence of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists and the elements of the arrangement qualify for separate accounting as described below under the residual method the fair value of the undelivered elements ie support and services based on our vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” of fair value is deferred and the remaining portion of the total arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements ie perpetual software license if evidence of the fair value of one or more of the undelivered elements does not exist all revenues are deferred and recognized when delivery of all of those elements has occurred or when fair values can be established we determine vsoe of the fair value of services and support revenue based upon our recent pricing for those elements when sold separately for certain transactions vsoe is determined based on a substantive renewal clause within a customer contract our current pricing practices are influenced primarily by product type purchase volume sales channel and customer location we review services and support sold separately on a periodic basis and update when appropriate our vsoe of fair value for such elements to ensure that it reflects our recent pricing experience 

professional services 

our software arrangements often include implementation consulting and training services that are sold under consulting engagement contracts or as part of the software license arrangement when we determine that such services are not essential to the functionality of the licensed software we record revenue separately for the license and service elements of these arrangements provided that 

appropriate evidence of fair value exists for the undelivered services ie vsoe of fair value we consider various factors in assessing whether a service is not essential to the functionality of the software including if the services may be provided by independent third parties experienced in providing such services ie consulting and implementation in coordination with dedicated customer personnel and whether the services result in significant modification or customization of the software’s functionality when professional services qualify for separate accounting professional services revenues under time and materials billing arrangements are recognized as the services are performed professional services revenues under fixedpriced contracts are generally recognized as the services are performed using a proportionate performance model with hours or costs as the input method of attribution 

when we provide professional services that are considered essential to the functionality of the software the arrangement does not qualify for separate accounting of the license and service elements and the license revenue is recognized together with the consulting services using the percentageofcompletion method of contract accounting under such arrangements consideration is recognized as the services are performed as measured by an observable input in these circumstances we separate license revenue from service revenue for income statement presentation by allocating vsoe of fair value of the consulting services as service revenue and the residual portion as license revenue under the percentageofcompletion method we estimate the stage of completion of contracts with fixed or “not to exceed” fees based on hours or costs incurred to date as compared with estimated total project hours or costs at completion adjustments to estimates to complete are made in the periods in which facts resulting in a change become known when total cost estimates exceed revenues we accrue for the estimated losses when identified the use of the proportionate performance and percentageofcompletion methods of accounting require significant judgment relative to estimating total contract costs or hours hours being a proxy for costs including assumptions relative to the length of time to complete the project the nature and complexity of the work to be performed and anticipated changes in salaries and other costs 

reimbursements of outofpocket expenditures incurred in connection with providing consulting services are included in professional services revenue with the offsetting expense recorded in cost of professional services revenue 

training services include onsite and classroom training training revenues are recognized as the related training services are provided 

accounting for income taxes 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to calculate our income tax expense based on taxable income by jurisdiction there are many transactions and calculations about which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain as a result our calculations involve estimates by management some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenuesharing costreimbursement and transfer pricing arrangements among related entities and the differing tax treatment of revenue and cost items across various jurisdictions if we were compelled to revise or to account differently for our arrangements that revision could affect our tax liability 

the income tax accounting process also involves estimating our actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheets we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized we must establish a valuation allowance as a charge to income tax expense 

as of september 30 2017 we have a valuation allowance of 2393 million  against net deferred tax assets in the us and a valuation allowance of 404 million  against net deferred tax assets in certain foreign jurisdictions we have concluded based on the weight of available evidence that a full valuation allowance continues to be required against our us net deferred tax assets as they are not more likely than not to be realized in the future we will continue to reassess our valuation allowance requirements each financial reporting period 

the valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets of certain foreign jurisdictions is established primarily for our net operating loss carryforwards the majority of which do not expire there 

are limitations imposed on the utilization of such net operating losses that could further restrict the recognition of any tax benefits 

we have not provided for us income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on foreign unrepatriated earnings as it is our current intention to permanently reinvest these earnings outside the us unless repatriation can be done with no significant tax cost with the exception of a foreign holding company formed in 2014 and our taiwan subsidiary in 2017 we established a deferred tax liability of 11 million to provide for taxes on the unremitted earnings of this foreign holding company and in 2016 we incurred us tax expense of 12 million  on the repatriation of the 2016 earnings of this foreign holding company in 2017 and 2016 the tax provision associated with these earnings was offset by a corresponding change in the valuation allowance if we decide to repatriate any additional nonus earnings in the future we may be required to establish a deferred tax liability on such earnings the cumulative basis difference associated with the undistributed earnings of our subsidiaries totaled approximately 882 million  and 789 million  as of september 30 2017  and 2016  respectively the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability on the undistributed earnings cannot be practicably determined at this time 

in the normal course of business ptc and its subsidiaries are examined by various taxing authorities including the internal revenue service irs in the us we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate we are currently under audit by tax authorities in several jurisdictions audits by tax authorities typically involve examination of the deductibility of certain permanent items transfer pricing limitations on net operating losses and tax credits although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in material changes in our estimates 

valuation of assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations 

in accordance with business combination accounting we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values determining these fair values requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets 

our identifiable intangible assets acquired consist of developed technology core technology tradenames customer lists and contracts and software support agreements and related relationships developed technology consists of products that have reached technological feasibility core technology represents a combination of processes inventions and trade secrets related to the design and development of acquired products customer lists and contracts and software support agreements and related relationships represent the underlying relationships and agreements with customers of the acquired company’s installed base we have generally valued intangible assets using a discounted cash flow model critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to 

 in addition we estimate the useful lives of our intangible assets based upon the expected period over which we anticipate generating economic benefits from the related intangible asset 

net tangible assets consist of the fair values of tangible assets less the fair values of assumed liabilities and obligations except for deferred revenues net tangible assets were generally valued by us at the respective carrying amounts recorded by the acquired company if we believed that their carrying values approximated their fair values at the acquisition date the values assigned to deferred revenue reflect an amount equivalent to the estimated cost plus an appropriate profit margin to perform the services related to the acquired company’s software support contracts 

in addition uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date and we reevaluate these items quarterly with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill provided that we are within the measurement period up to one year from the acquisition date and we continue to collect information in order to determine their estimated values subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the estimated value of uncertain tax positions or tax related valuation allowances whichever comes first changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of operations 

our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable at that time but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions estimates or actual results 

when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a finitelived intangible asset may not be recoverable we perform an assessment of the asset for potential impairment this assessment is based on projected undiscounted future cash flows over the asset’s remaining life if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its undiscounted cash flows we record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset determined using projected discounted future cash flows of the asset 

valuation of goodwill 

our goodwill totaled 11828 million and 11698 million  as of september 30 2017  and 2016  respectively we assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level our reporting units are determined based on the components of our operating segments that constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and for which operating results are regularly reviewed by segment management we have three operating and reportable segments 1 the solutions group 2 the iot group and 3 professional services 

as of september 30 2017  goodwill and acquired intangible assets in the aggregate attributable to our solutions group iot group and professional services segment was 11756 million  2344 million  and 306 million  respectively as of september 30 2016  goodwill and acquired intangible assets in the aggregate attributable to our solutions group iot group and professional services segment was 11966 million  2528 million  and 307 million  respectively we test goodwill for impairment in the third quarter of our fiscal year or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting segment below its carrying value factors we consider important on an overall company basis and reportable segment basis as applicable that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results significant changes in our use of the acquired assets or a significant change in the strategy for our business significant negative industry or economic trends a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period or a reduction of our market capitalization relative to net book value 

 we completed our annual goodwill impairment review as of july 1 2017 based on a qualitative assessment our qualitative assessment included company specific financial performance and longrange plans industry and macroeconomic factors and consideration of the fair value of each reporting unit which was approximately double its carrying value or higher at july 2 2016 the last valuation date based on our qualitative assessment we believe it is more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units exceed their carrying values and no further impairment testing is required 

accounting for pensions 

we sponsor several international pension plans we make assumptions that are used in calculating the expense and liability of these plans these key assumptions include the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate used to determine the present value of benefit obligations in selecting the expected longterm rate of return on assets we consider the average future rate of earnings expected on the funds invested to provide for the benefits under the pension plan this includes considering the plans asset allocations and the expected returns likely to be earned over the life of the plans the discount rate reflects the estimated rate at which an amount that is invested in a portfolio of highquality debt instruments would provide the future cash flows necessary to pay benefits when they come due the actuarial assumptions used by us may differ materially from actual results due to 

changing market and economic conditions or longer or shorter life spans of the participants our actual results could differ materially from those we estimated which could require us to record a greater amount of pension expense in future years andor require higher than expected cash contributions 

accounting and reporting for these plans requires the use of countryspecific assumptions for discount rates and expected rates of return on assets we apply a consistent methodology in determining the key assumptions that in addition to future experience assumptions such as mortality rates are used by our actuaries to determine our liability and expense for each of these plans the discount rate for germany was selected with reference to a spotrate yield curve based on the yields of aarated eurodenominated corporate bonds in addition our actuarial consultants determine the expense and liabilities of the plan using other assumptions for future experience such as mortality rates in determining our pension cost for 2017  2016  and 2015  we used weighted average discount rates of 13  22  and 24  respectively and weighted average expected returns on plan assets of 54  57  and 58  respectively in 2017  2016  and 2015  our actual return loss on plan assets was 63 million  17 million and 04 million respectively if actual returns are below our expected rates of return it will impact the amount and timing of future contributions and expense for these plans 

as of september 30 2017  and 2016  our plans in total were underfunded representing the difference between our projected benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets by 167 million  and 308 million  respectively the projected benefit obligation as of september 30 2017  was determined using a weighted average discount rate of 18  the most sensitive assumptions used in calculating the expense and liability of our pension plans are the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets total gaap net periodic pension cost was 26 million  in 2017  and we expect it to be approximately 08 million  in 2018  a 50 basis point change to our discount rate and expected return on plan assets assumptions would have changed our pension expense for the year ended september 30 2017 by less than 1 million a 50 basis point decrease in our discount rate assumptions would increase our projected benefit obligation as of september 30 2017 by approximately 7 million 

legal contingencies 

we are periodically subject to various legal claims and involved in various legal proceedings we routinely review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any matter is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we record a liability for the estimated loss significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether the amount of an exposure is reasonably estimable because of inherent uncertainties related to these legal matters we base our loss accruals on the best information available at the time further estimates of this nature are highly subjective and the final outcome of these matters could vary significantly from the amounts that have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as additional information becomes available we reassess our potential liability and may revise our estimates such revisions could have a material impact on future quarterly or annual results of operations 

liquidity and capital resources 

  

cash and cash equivalents 

we invest our cash with highly rated financial institutions and in diversified domestic and international money market mutual funds cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less in addition we hold investments in marketable securities totaling approximately 503 million  with an average maturity of 18 months at september 30 2017  cash and cash equivalents totaled 2800 million  compared to 2779 million  at september 30 2016  reflecting 1346 million  in operating cash flow 152 million  of proceeds from sales of investments 108 million  of proceeds from issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan offset by 510 million  used for repurchases of common stock 400 million  of net repayments under our credit facility 267 million  used to pay withholding taxes on stockbased awards that vested in the period 254 million  used for capital expenditures 111 million  used for payment of contingent consideration and 50 million  used for acquisitions 

cash provided by operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities was 1346 million  in 2017  compared to 1832 million  in 2016  and 1799 million  in 2015  the decrease in 2017 is primarily due to an increase in bonus and commission payments of approximately 33 million lower cash collections from accounts receivable of 27 million due to higher 2016 collections of receivables with extended payment terms and a higher subscription mix in 2017  higher interest payments of approximately 26 million   and a 12 million payment related to a korean tax audit partially offset by a   35 million increase in cash flows from accounts payable and accrued expenses due to renegotiations with vendors and more effective utilization of available payment terms    18 million of lower restructuring payments and 28 million paid in 2016 to resolve the regulatory investigation with respect to our china business 

cash provided by operations in 2016 reflects lower contributions to pension plans 447 million lower in 2016 compared to 2015 

 restructuring payments totaled 371 million  in 2017 compared to 550 million  in 2016 and 536 million  in 2015 cash paid for income taxes was 354 million  255 million  and 301 million  in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively 

cash used by investing activities   



we spent approximately 5 million on acquisitions in 2017 in the second quarter of 2016 we acquired kepware for 994 million  net of cash acquired and in the first quarter of 2016 we acquired vuforia for 648 million  net of cash acquired in the third quarter of 2015 we acquired coldlight for 986 million  net of cash acquired 

in 2017 we disposed of minority investments in preferred stock for proceeds of approximately 15 million which we purchased in 2015 for 11 million 

in 2016 we invested in investment grade securities with maturities up to three years 

our expenditures for property and equipment consist primarily of computer equipment software office equipment and facility improvements 

cash provided used by financing activities 

  



in 2017 we resumed our stock repurchase program and used 510 million  to repurchase our common stock repaid 400 million  under our credit facility and received 108 million  of proceeds from our employee stock purchase plan in 2016 credit facility origination costs included costs associated with issuing our 2024 6 notes in 2015 we borrowed 100 million  as a result of the purchase of coldlight and used 649 million  to repurchase shares 

credit agreement 

in november 2015 we entered into a multicurrency credit facility with a syndicate of banks as a result of an amendment to the credit facility in march 2017 the revolving loan commitment was reduced to 600 million from 900 million the revolving loan commitment may be increased by an additional 500 million if the existing or additional lenders are willing to make such increased commitments due to the decrease in the loan commitment amount under the credit facility associated annual commitment fees will decline by approximately 09 million outstanding revolving loan amounts may be repaid in whole or in part without penalty or premium prior to the september 15 2019 maturity date when all remaining amounts outstanding will be due and payable in full 

we use the credit facility for general corporate purposes including acquisitions of businesses share repurchases and working capital requirements as of september 30 2017 we had 2181 million  in revolving loans outstanding under the credit facility the fair value of which approximated its book value as of september 30 2017 we have approximately 382 million undrawn of which 369 million would be available to borrow the availability of which is reduced by letters of credit and certain other long term liabilities 

any borrowings by ptc inc or certain of our foreign subsidiaries under the credit facility would be guaranteed respectively by our material domestic subsidiaries that become parties to the subsidiary guaranty if any andor by ptc inc borrowings are also secured by first priority liens on property of ptc and certain of our material domestic subsidiaries including 100 of the voting equity interests of certain of our domestic subsidiaries and 65 of our material firsttier foreign subsidiaries loans under the credit facility bear interest at variable rates that reset every 30 to 180 days depending on the rate and period selected by us and based upon our total leverage ratio during 2017 the weighted average annual interest rate for all borrowings outstanding was 494  and as of september 30 2017 the rate on the credit facility was 3125  we also pay a quarterly commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the credit facility ranging from 0175 to 030 per year based on our total leverage ratio 

the credit facility imposes customary covenants that limit our ability to incur liens or guarantee obligations pay dividends and make other distributions make investments and engage in certain other transactions in addition we and our material domestic subsidiaries may not invest in or loan to our foreign subsidiaries in aggregate amounts exceeding 75 million for any purpose and an additional 200 million for acquisitions of businesses we also must maintain the following financial ratios 



       any failure to comply with such covenants would prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds and would constitute a default permitting the lenders to among other things accelerate the amounts outstanding and terminate the credit facility as of september 30 2017 we were in compliance with all financial and operating covenants of the credit facility 

outstanding notes 

on may 12 2016 we issued 500 million of 600 senior notes due 2024 the “2024 6 notes” in a registered offering and used the net proceeds to prepay indebtedness under our senior credit facility as of september 30 2017 unamortized deferred financing fees associated with the offering and presented as a direct reduction from the carrying amount of the 2024 6 notes were 57 million  

the 2024 6 notes are unsecured mature on may 15 2024 and bear interest at a rate of 600 per annum payable semiannually november and may at any time before may 15 2019 i we may redeem up to 40 of the aggregate principal amount of the 2024 6 notes with the net cash proceeds of certain public equity offerings at a price equal to 10600 of the aggregate principal amount redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest provided that at least 60 of the 2024 6 notes that were originally issued remain outstanding immediately thereafter and ii we may redeem some or all of the 2024 6 notes at a price equal to 100 of the aggregate principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest and a makewhole premium on or after may 15 2019 we may redeem some or all of the 2024 6 notes at redemption prices specified in the 2024 6 notes plus accrued and unpaid interest in addition if we undergo a change of control we will be required to make an offer to purchase all the 2024 6 notes at a price equal to 101 of the principal amount of the 2024 6 notes plus accrued and unpaid interest 

the notes were issued under an indenture that contains customary covenants subject to certain exceptions our ability to incur certain additional debt is limited unless after giving pro forma effect to such incurrence and the application of the proceeds thereof the ratio of our ebitda to our consolidated fixed charges as both terms are defined in the indenture is not greater than 200 to 100 the indenture also restricts our ability to incur liens pay dividends or make certain other distributions sell assets or engage in saleleaseback transactions any failure to comply with these and other covenants included in the indenture could constitute an event of default that could result in the acceleration of the payment of the aggregate principal amount of 2024 6 notes then outstanding and accrued interest as of september 30 2017 we were in compliance with all such covenants 

share repurchase authorization 

our articles of organization authorize us to issue up to 500 million  shares of our common stock our board of directors has periodically authorized the repurchase of shares of our common stock in august 2014 our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to 600 million  of our common stock through 

september 30 2017 on september 14 2017 our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to 500 million  of our common stock from october 1 2017 through september 30 2020 

we intend to use cash from operations and borrowings under our credit facility to make such repurchases in 2017 we repurchased 09 million  shares at cost of 510 million  in 2016 we did not repurchase any shares due to the accelerated pace of our transition to a subscription business model and the nearterm impact on free cash flow and ebitda we repurchased 27 million  shares at a cost of 649 million  in 2015 all shares of our common stock repurchased are automatically restored to the status of authorized and unissued 

expectations for fiscal 2018 

our transition to a subscription licensing model has had and will continue to have an adverse impact on revenue operating margin and eps relative to periods in which we primarily sold perpetual licenses until the expected transition of our customer base to subscription is completed this also affects consolidated ebitda as calculated under our credit facility and as a result of the total leverage ratio under the facility limits the amount we can borrow under the facility notwithstanding the effect of the subscription transition and those limitations we believe that existing cash and cash equivalents together with cash generated from operations and amounts available under the credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements which we expect to be 40 million in 2018 through at least the next twelve months and to meet our known longterm capital requirements 

our expected uses of cash could change our cash position could be reduced and we could incur additional debt obligations if we purchase our outstanding shares or retire debt or engage in strategic transactions any of which could be commenced suspended or completed at any time any such purchases or retirement of debt will depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors we also evaluate possible strategic transactions on an ongoing basis and at any given time may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to possible strategic transactions the amounts involved in any share or debt repurchases or strategic transactions may be material 

we ended 2017 with a cash balance of 280 million and marketable securities of 50 million a significant portion of our cash is generated and held outside of the united states at september 30 2017 we had cash and cash equivalents of 268 million  in the united states 1281 million  in europe 681 million  in the pacific rim including india 302 million  in japan and 268 million  in other nonus countries all of the marketable securities are held in europe we have substantial cash requirements in the united states but we believe that the combination of our existing us cash and cash equivalents marketable securities and future us operating cash flows and cash available under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our ongoing us operating expenses and known capital requirements 

contractual obligations 

at september 30 2017  our contractual obligations were as follows 

  



  



amounts outstanding will be due and payable in full principal and interest on any additional borrowing that may be required to refinance the credit facility upon its maturity are not included in the contractual obligations above 

 as of september 30 2017  we had letters of credit and bank guarantees outstanding of approximately 43 million  of which 12 million  was collateralized primarily related to our corporate headquarters lease in needham massachusetts 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have not created and are not party to any specialpurpose or offbalance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital incurring debt or operating parts of our business that are not consolidated to the extent of our ownership interest therein into our financial statements we have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby we have subordinated retained interests derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks contingent liabilities or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing liquidity market risk or credit risk support to us 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in accordance with recently issued accounting pronouncements we will be required to comply with certain changes in accounting rules and regulations refer to note b summary of significant accounting policies to the condensed consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for all recently issued accounting pronouncements we are currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on our consolidated financial statements outlined below are the recent accounting pronouncements that we believe will have the most significant impact on us 

income taxes 

in october 2016 the fasb issued asu 201616 income taxes topic 740 intraentity transfers of assets other than inventory “asu 201616” the purpose of asu 201616 is to simplify the income tax accounting of an intraentity transfer of an asset other than inventory and to record its effect when the transfer occurs the guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 our fiscal 2019 including interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods and early adoption is permitted we are currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on our consolidated financial statements we expect to record a net deferred tax asset of approximately 77 million upon adoption primarily relating to deductible amortization of intangibles in ireland post adoption our effective tax rate will no longer include the benefit of this amortization which is reflected in our effective tax rate reconciliation under the current guidance 

leases 

in february 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201602 leases topic 842 which will replace the existing guidance in asc 840 leases the updated standard aims to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by requiring lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and to disclose important information about leasing arrangements asu 201602 is effective for annual periods beginning after december 15 2018 our fiscal 2020 and interim periods within those annual periods early adoption is permitted and modified retrospective application is required we are currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 asu 201409 asu 201409 supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under us gaap the fasb has also issued additional standards to provide clarification and implementation guidance on asu 201409 

the core principle of asu 201409 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services under the new guidance an entity is required to evaluate revenue recognition through a fivestep process 1 identifying a contract with a customer 2 identifying the performance obligations in the contract 3 determining the transaction price 4 allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and 5 recognizing revenue when or as the entity satisfies a performance obligation the standard also requires disclosure of the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers in applying the principles in asu 201409 it is possible more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than is required under existing us gaap including identifying performance obligations estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and estimating the value of each performance obligation to allocate the total transaction price to each separate performance obligation 

asu 201409 is effective for us in our first quarter of fiscal 2019 companies may adopt asu 201409 using either the retrospective method under which each prior reporting period is presented under asu 201409 with the option to elect certain permitted practical expedients or the modified retrospective method under which a company adopts asu 201409 from the beginning of the year of initial application with no restatement of comparative periods with the cumulative effect of initially applying asu 201409 recognized at the date of initial application with certain additional required disclosures we currently expect to adopt asu 201409 using the modified retrospective method 

while we are continuing to assess the impact of the new standard we currently believe the most significant impact relates to accounting for our subscription arrangements that include termbased on premise software licenses bundled with support under current gaap the revenue attributable to these subscription licenses is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement because vsoe does not exist for the undelivered support element as it is not sold separately under the new standard the requirement to have vsoe for undelivered elements to enable the separation of revenue for the delivered software licenses is eliminated accordingly under the new standard we will be required to recognize as revenue a portion of the subscription fee upon delivery of the software license we currently expect revenue related to our perpetual license revenue and related support contracts professional services and cloud offerings to remain substantially unchanged due to the complexity of certain of our contracts the actual revenue 

recognition treatment required under the new standard may be dependent on contractspecific terms and therefore may vary in some instances 

upon implementation of the new standard in fiscal 2019 we expect to make revisions to contract terms with our customers that will result in shortening the initial noncancellable term of our multiyear subscriptions to one year this change will result in annual contractual periods for the majority of our software subscriptions the license portion of which will be recognized at the beginning of each annual contract period upon delivery of the licenses and the support portion of which will be recognized ratably over the one year contractual period as a result we anticipate one year of subscription revenue will be recognized for each contract each year however more of the revenue will be recognized in the quarter that the contract period begins and less will be recognized in the subsequent three quarters of the contract than under the current accounting rules 

under the modified retrospective method we will evaluate each contract that is ongoing on the adoption date as if that contract had been accounted for under asu 201409 from contract inception some license revenue related to subscription arrangements that would have been recognized in future periods under current gaap will be recast under asu 201409 as if the revenue had been recognized in prior periods under this transition method we will not adjust historical reported revenue amounts instead the revenue that would have been recognized under this method prior to the adoption date will be an adjustment to retained earnings and will not be recognized as revenue in future periods as previously planned because we expect that license revenue associated with subscription contracts will be recognized up front instead of over time under asu 201409 we expect to have some portion of our deferred revenue to be adjusted to retained earnings upon adoption which could be material during the first year of adoption we will disclose the amount of this retained earnings adjustment and intend to provide supplemental disclosure of how this revenue would have been recognized under the current rules 

another significant provision under asu 201409 includes the capitalization and amortization of costs associated with obtaining a contract such as sales commissions currently we expense sales commissions in the period incurred under asu 201409 direct and incremental costs to acquire a contract are capitalized and amortized using a systematic basis over the pattern of transfer of the goods and services to which the asset relates while we are continuing to assess the impact of this provision of asu 201409 we likely will be required to capitalize incremental costs such as commissions and amortize those costs over the period the capitalized assets are expected to contribute to future cash flows 

furthermore we have made and will continue to make investments in systems and processes to enable timely and accurate reporting under the new standard we currently expect that necessary operational and internal control structural changes will be implemented prior to the adoption date 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we face exposure to financial market risks including adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 

foreign currency exchange risk 

our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to western european countries japan china and canada we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates that arise from receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies we do not enter into or hold foreign currency derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes nor do we enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge future cash flow or forecast transactions 

our nonus revenues generally are transacted through our nonus subsidiaries and typically are denominated in their local currency in addition expenses that are incurred by our nonus subsidiaries typically are denominated in their local currency in 2017 2016 and 2015 approximately twothirds of our revenue and half of our expenses were transacted in currencies other than the us dollar currency translation affects our reported results because we report our results of operations in us dollars historically our most significant currency risk has been changes in the euro and japanese yen relative to the us dollar based on current revenue and expense levels excluding restructuring charges and stockbased compensation a 010 change in the usd to european exchange rates and a 10 yen change in 

the yen to usd exchange rate would impact operating income by approximately 14 million and 5 million respectively 

our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations arises in part from intercompany transactions with most intercompany transactions occurring between a us dollar functional currency entity and a foreign currency denominated entity intercompany transactions typically are denominated in the local currency of the nonus dollar functional currency subsidiary in order to centralize foreign currency risk also both ptc the parent company and our nonus subsidiaries may transact business with our customers and vendors in a currency other than their functional currency transaction risk in addition we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results and balances of our nonus subsidiaries are translated into us dollars translation risk if sales to customers outside of the united states increase our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will increase 

our foreign currency risk management strategy is principally designed to mitigate the future potential financial impact of changes in the us dollar value of balances denominated in foreign currency resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates our foreign currency hedging program uses forward contracts to manage the foreign currency exposures that exist as part of our ongoing business operations the contracts primarily are denominated in canadian dollars and european currencies and have maturities of less than three months 

generally we do not designate foreign currency forward contracts as hedges for accounting purposes and changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized immediately in earnings because we enter into forward contracts only as an economic hedge any gain or loss on the underlying foreigndenominated balance would be offset by the loss or gain on the forward contract gains and losses on forward contracts and foreign denominated receivables and payables are included in foreign currency net losses 

as of september 30 2017  and 2016  we had outstanding forward contracts for derivatives not designated as hedging instruments with notional amounts equivalent to the following     

as of september 30 2017  and 2016  we had outstanding forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges with notional amounts equivalent to the following 



debt 

 in addition to amounts due under our 2024 6 notes as described above as of september 30 2017  we had 2181 million  outstanding under our variablerate credit facility loans under the credit facility bear interest at variable rates which reset every 30  to 180  days depending on the rate and period selected by us these loans are subject to interest rate risk as interest rates will be adjusted at each rollover date to the extent such amounts are not repaid as of september 30 2017  the annual rate on the credit facility loans was 3125  if there was a hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates the annual net impact to earnings and cash flows would be 22 million this hypothetical change in cash flows and earnings has been calculated based on the borrowings outstanding at september 30 2017 and a 100 basis point per annum change in interest rate applied over a oneyear period 

cash and cash equivalents 

as of september 30 2017  cash equivalents were invested in highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased we invest our cash with highly rated financial institutions in north america europe and asiapacific and in diversified domestic and international money market mutual funds at september 30 2017  we had cash and cash equivalents of 268 million  in the united states 1281 million  in europe 681 million  in the pacific rim including india 302 million  in japan and 268 million  in other nonus countries given the short maturities and investment grade quality of the portfolio holdings at september 30 2017  a hypothetical 10 change in interest rates would not materially affect the fair value of our cash and cash equivalents 

our invested cash is subject to interest rate fluctuations and for nonus operations foreign currency risk in a declining interest rate environment we would experience a decrease in interest income the opposite holds true in a rising interest rate environment over the past several years the us federal reserve board european central bank and bank of england have changed certain benchmark interest rates which have led to declines and increases in market interest rates these changes in market interest rates have resulted in fluctuations in interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents interest income will continue to fluctuate based on changes in market interest rates and levels of cash available for investment our consolidated cash balances were impacted favorably by 11 million  and 68 million  in 2017  and 2016  respectively and unfavorably by 179 million  in 2015  due to changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar particularly the euro and the japanese yen

the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of september 30 2017  has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which appears under item 8 

change in internal control over financial reporting 

there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended september 30 2017  that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

risk factors 

tableend 

the following are important factors we have identified that could affect our future results you should consider them carefully when evaluating an investment in ptc’s securities or any forwardlooking statements made by us including those contained in this annual report because these factors could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or the performance projected in forwardlooking statements the risks described below are not the only risks we face additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business financial condition andor operating results holders of the 600 senior notes due 2024 the “2024 6 notes” that we issued in may 2016 should also consider the risk factors related to those notes described in the prospectus we filed with the securities and exchange commission on may 5 2016 which are incorporated herein by reference 

i operational considerations 

our operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter making future operating results difficult to predict failure to meet market expectations could cause the price of our securities to decline 

our quarterly operating results historically have fluctuated and are likely to continue to fluctuate depending on a number of factors including 

 accordingly our quarterly results are difficult to predict prior to the end of the quarter and we may be unable to confirm or adjust expectations with respect to our operating results for a particular quarter until that quarter has closed any failure to meet our quarterly revenue or earnings targets could adversely impact the market price of our securities 

we now offer our solutions as subscriptions which has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our revenue and earnings in the transition period and make predicting our revenue and earnings more difficult 

we began offering most of our solutions under a subscription option in 2015 in addition to our perpetual license option under a subscription customers pay a periodic fee for the right to use our software and receive support or to use our cloud services and have us manage the application for a specified period under a subscription revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the subscription while under a perpetual license revenue is generally recognized upon purchase a significant number of our customers have elected to purchase our solutions as subscriptions rather than under perpetual licenses as a result our license revenues have declined our support revenue which comprises a significant portion of our revenue may also decrease due to support services being included in the subscription offering and to customers converting their support contracts into subscriptions 

our revenue and earnings targets are based on assumptions about the mix of revenue that will be attributable to subscription and perpetual license revenue if a greater percentage of our customers elect to purchase our solutions as subscriptions in a period than we assumed our revenue and earnings will likely fall below our expectations for that period as occurred in 2016 which could cause our stock price to decline 

our long range financial targets are predicated on bookings and revenue growth and operating margin improvements that we may fail to achieve which could reduce our expected earnings and cause us to fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors and cause the price of our securities to decline 

we are projecting longterm bookings revenue and earnings growth our projections are based on the expected growth potential in the iot market as well as more modest growth in our core cad plm and slm markets we may not achieve the expected bookings and revenue growth if the markets we serve do not grow at expected rates if customers do not purchase or renew subscriptions as we expect if we are not able to deliver solutions desired by customers and potential customers andor if acquired businesses do not generate the revenue growth that we expect 

our longterm operating margin improvement targets are predicated on operating leverage as long range revenue increases and on improved operating efficiencies particularly within our sales organization and on service margin improvements services margins are significantly lower than license and support margins future projected improvements in our operating margin as a percent of revenue are based in part on our ability to improve services margins by reducing the amount of direct services that we perform through expansion of our service partner program and improving the profitability of services that we perform if our services revenue increases as a percentage of total revenue andor if we are unable to improve our services margins our overall operating margin may not increase to the levels we expect or may decrease additionally if we do not achieve lower sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue through productivity initiatives we may not achieve our operating margin targets if operating margins do not improve our earnings could be adversely affected and the price of our securities could decline 

our significant investment in our iot business may not generate the revenues we expect which could adversely affect our business and financial results   

we have made a significant investment in recent years in our iot business including five acquisitions totaling approximately 550 million our iot business provides technology solutions that enable customers to transform their businesses and leverage the opportunities created by the iot 

the internet of things is a relatively new market and there are a significant number of competitors in the market if the market does not expand as rapidly as we or others expect or if customers adopt competitive solutions rather than our solutions our iot business may not generate the revenues we expect 

further one market for our iot business is as a platform provider to a broad ecosystem of application and solutions providers this market relies on an extensive and differentiated partner ecosystem to enable us to access markets and customers beyond our traditional markets customers and buyers we may be unable to expand our partner ecosystem as we expect and developers may not adopt our iot solutions as we expect which would adversely affect our ability to realize revenue from our investments in this business 

we depend on sales within the discrete manufacturing sector and our business could be adversely affected if manufacturing activity does not grow or if it contracts 

a large amount of our sales are to customers in the discrete manufacturing sector if this economic sector does not grow or if it contracts our customers in this sector may as they have in the past reduce or defer purchases of our products and services which adversely affects our business in 2016 and 2015 the manufacturing sector was weak worldwide which we believe adversely impacted our sales and operating results although we have seen some improvement in the latter part of 2016 if manufacturing economic conditions do not continue to improve or if they deteriorate sales could be adversely affected 

we face significant competition which may reduce our profits and limit or reduce our market share 

the market for product development solutions and iot solutions is rapidly changing and characterized by vigorous competition both by entry of competitors with innovative technologies and by consolidation of companies with complementary products and technologies this competition could result in price reductions for our products and services reduced margins loss of customers and loss of market share our primary competition comes from 

 in addition barriers to entry into certain segments of the software industry have declined and the ability of customers to adopt software solutions has increased with the ability to offer software in the cloud and the increasing prevalence of subscription license models and customer acceptance of both those models because of these and other factors competitive conditions in the industry are likely to intensify in the future 

increased competition could result in price reductions reduced net revenue and profit margins and loss of market share any of which would likely harm our business 

a breach of security in our products or computer systems or those of our thirdparty service providers could compromise the integrity of our products harm our reputation create additional liability and adversely impact our financial results  

we have implemented and continue to implement measures intended to maintain the security and integrity of our products source code and computer systems the potential consequences of a security breach or system disruption particularly through cyberattack or cyberintrusion including by computer hackers foreign governments and cyber terrorists have increased in scope as the number intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased despite efforts to create security barriers to such threats it is impossible for us to entirely eliminate this risk in addition we offer cloud services to our customers and some of our products are hosted by thirdparty service providers which expose us to additional risks as those repositories of our customers’ proprietary data may be targeted by such hackers a significant breach of the security andor integrity of our products or systems or those of our thirdparty service providers could prevent our products from functioning properly could enable access to sensitive proprietary or confidential information including that of our customers without authorization or could disrupt our business operations or those of our customers this could require us to incur significant costs of remediation harm our reputation cause customers to stop buying our products and cause us to face lawsuits and potential liability which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

businesses we acquire may not generate the revenue and earnings we anticipate and may otherwise adversely affect our business 

we have acquired and intend to continue to acquire new businesses and technologies if we fail to successfully integrate and manage the businesses and technologies we acquire or if an acquisition does not further our business strategy as we expect our operating results will be adversely affected 

moreover business combinations also involve a number of risks and uncertainties that can adversely affect our operations and operating results including 

 our restructuring actions and reorganization may be disruptive and could harm our operations 

over the past few years we have taken a number of restructuring actions and reorganizations designed to realign our global workforce to our business needs reduce our expenses and enable us to increase investment in our iot business these actions may not have the expected longterm effect on our expenses or may not be sufficient to fully offset additional investments we may make in our business disruptions in operations have occurred and will likely continue to occur as a result of these actions disruptions may include attrition beyond our planned reduction in workforce a negative effect on employee morale or our ability to attract highly skilled employees further we could experience delays business disruptions decreased productivity unanticipated employee turnover and increased litigationrelated costs in connection with the restructuring and other efficiency initiatives 

our sales and operations are globally dispersed which exposes us to additional compliance risks which could adversely affect our business and financial results 

we sell and deliver software and services and maintain support operations in a large number of countries whose laws and practices differ from one another and are subject to unexpected changes managing these geographically dispersed operations requires significant attention and resources to ensure compliance with laws of those countries and those of the us governing our activities in nonus countries 

those laws include but are not limited to anticorruption laws and regulations including the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and the uk bribery act 2010 and trade and economic sanctions laws and regulations including laws administered by the us department of the treasury’s office of foreign assets control the us state department the us department of commerce the united nations security council and other relevant sanctions authorities the fcpa and uk bribery act prohibit us and business partners or agents acting on our behalf from offering or providing anything of value to persons considered to be foreign officials under those laws for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business the uk bribery act also prohibits commercial bribery and accepting bribes our compliance risks with these laws are heightened due to the global nature of our business our new gotomarket approach for our iot business that relies heavily on expanding our partner ecosystem the fact that we operate in and are expanding into countries with a higher incidence of corruption and fraudulent business practices than others and the fact that we deal with governments and stateowned business enterprises the employees and representatives of which may be considered foreign officials for purposes of the fcpa and the uk bribery act 

accordingly while we strive to maintain a comprehensive compliance program we cannot guarantee that an employee agent or business partner will not act in violation of our policies or us or other applicable laws investigations of alleged violations of those laws can be expensive and disruptive violations of such laws can lead to civil andor criminal prosecutions substantial fines and other sanctions including the revocation of our rights to continue certain operations and also cause business and reputation loss 

our international businesses present economic and operating risks which could adversely affect our business and financial results 

we expect that our international operations will continue to expand and to account for a significant portion of our total revenue because we transact business in various foreign currencies the volatility of foreign exchange rates has had and may in the future have a material adverse effect on our revenue expenses and operating results 

other risks inherent in our international operations include but are not limited to the following 

 we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights which could adversely affect our business and our ability to compete effectively 

our software products are proprietary we protect our intellectual property rights in these items by relying on copyrights trademarks patents and common law safeguards including trade secret protection as well as restrictions on disclosures and transferability contained in our agreements with other parties despite these measures the laws of all relevant jurisdictions may not afford adequate protection to our products and other intellectual property in addition we frequently encounter attempts by individuals and companies to pirate our software if our measures to protect our intellectual property rights fail others may be able to use those rights which could reduce our competitiveness and revenues 

in addition any legal action to protect our intellectual property rights that we may bring or be engaged in could be costly may distract management from daytoday operations and may lead to additional claims against us and we may not succeed all of which would materially adversely affect our operating results 

intellectual property infringement claims could be asserted against us which could be expensive to defend and could result in limitations on our use of the claimed intellectual property 

the software industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding copyright patent and other intellectual property rights as well as improper disclosure of confidential or proprietary information if a lawsuit of this type is filed it could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel we cannot be sure that we would prevail against any such asserted claims if we did not prevail we could be prevented from using the claimed intellectual property or be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements which might not be available on terms acceptable to us in addition to possible claims with respect to our proprietary products some of our products contain technology developed by and licensed from third parties and we may likewise be susceptible to infringement claims with respect to these thirdparty technologies 

our financial condition could be adversely affected if significant errors or defects are found in our software 

sophisticated software can sometimes contain errors defects or other performance problems if errors or defects are discovered in our products we may need to expend significant financial technical and management resources or divert some of our development resources in order to resolve or work around those defects and we may not be able to correct them in a timely manner or provide an adequate response to our customers 

errors defects or other performance problems in our products could also cause us to lose revenue lose customers and lose market share and could subject to liability such defects or problems could also damage our business reputation and cause us to lose new business opportunities 

we may have exposure to additional tax liabilities and our effective tax rate may increase or fluctuate which could increase our income tax expense and reduce our net income 

as a multinational organization we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes in the us and in various foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision and other tax liabilities in the ordinary course of a global business there are many intercompany transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain our tax returns are subject to review by various taxing authorities although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes could be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 

our effective tax rate can be adversely affected by several factors many of which are outside of our control including 



 because we have substantial cash requirements in the united states and a significant portion of our cash is generated and held outside of the united states if our cash available in the united states and the cash available under our credit facility is insufficient to meet our operating expenses and debt repayment obligations in the united states we may be required to raise cash in ways that could negatively affect our financial condition results of operations and the market price of our securities 

we have significant operations outside the united states as of september 30 2016 approximately 90 of our cash and cash equivalents balance was held by subsidiaries outside the united states with the remainder of the balance held by the us parent company or its subsidiaries in the united states we believe that the combination of our existing united states cash and cash equivalents future united states operating cash flows and cash available under our credit facility are sufficient to meet our ongoing united states operating expenses and known capital requirements however if these sources of cash are insufficient to meet our future financial obligations in the united states we will be required to seek other available funding sources or means to repatriate cash to the united states which could negatively impact our results of operations financial position and the market price of our securities 

ii other considerations 

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations as well as our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt 

we have a significant amount of indebtedness as of november 15 2016 our total debt outstanding was approximately818 million approximately 318 million of which was under our 900 million secured credit facility which matures in september 2019 and 500 million of which was associated with the 2024 6 notes which mature in may 2024 and are unsecured all amounts outstanding under the credit facility and the notes will be due and payable in full on their respective maturity dates as of november 15 2016 we had unused commitments under our credit facility of approximately 582 million ptc inc the parent company and one of our foreign subsidiaries are eligible borrowers under the credit facility and certain other foreign subsidiaries may become borrowers under our credit facility in the future subject to certain conditions 

notwithstanding the limits contained in the credit agreement governing our credit facility and the indenture governing our 2024 6 notes we may be able to incur substantial additional debt from time to time to finance working capital capital expenditures investments or acquisitions or for other purposes if we do so the risks related to our high level of debt could intensify specifically our high level of debt could 

 any of the abovelisted factors could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt agreements 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness which may not be successful 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control we may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness 

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness we may not be able to effect any such alternative measures if necessary on commercially reasonable terms or at all and even if successful those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations our debt agreements restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due 

our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all would materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations and our ability to satisfy our debt obligations 

if we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt we will be in default and the lenders under our credit facility could terminate their commitments to loan money the lenders could foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings the holders of our 2024 6 notes could declare all outstanding principal premium if any and interest to be due and payable and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation all of these events could result in a loss of your investment 

we are required to comply with certain financial and operating covenants under our debt agreements any failure to comply with those covenants could cause amounts borrowed to become immediately due and payable andor prevent us from borrowing under the credit facility 

we are required to comply with specified financial and operating covenants under our debt agreements and to make payments under our debt which limit our ability to operate our business as we otherwise might operate it our failure to comply with any of these covenants or to meet any debt payment obligations could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived would result in any amounts outstanding including any accrued interest andor unpaid fees becoming immediately due and payable we might not have sufficient working capital or liquidity to satisfy any repayment obligations in the event of an acceleration of those obligations in addition if we are not in compliance with the financial and operating covenants under the credit facility at the time we wish to borrow funds we will be unable to borrow funds 

in addition the financial and operating covenants under the credit facility may limit our ability to borrow funds including for strategic acquisitions and share repurchases for example as of september 30 2016 although we had unused commitments under our credit facility of approximately 6419 million due to the financial covenants only approximately 100 million would have been available for borrowing 

we may be unable to meet our goal of returning 40 of free cash flow to shareholders through share repurchases which could decrease your expected return on investment in ptc stock 

in august 2014 we announced a new capital allocation strategy a component of which is a longterm goal of returning approximately 40 of free cash flow cash flow from operations less capital expenditures to shareholders through share repurchases meeting this goal requires ptc to generate consistent free cash flow and have available capital in the years ahead in an amount sufficient to enable us to continue investing in organic and inorganic growth as well as to return a significant portion of the cash generated to stockholders in the form of share repurchases we may not meet this goal if we do not generate the free cash flow we expect if we use our available cash to satisfy other priorities or have insufficient funds available to make such repurchases for example in 2016 we made no repurchases due to limits on our borrowing capacity as a result of covenant limitations under our credit facility specifically our leverage ratio as a result of lower earnings due to our subscription transition limited our ability to borrow 

additionally our cash flow fluctuates over the course of the year and over multiple years so although our goal is to return 40 of free cash flow to shareholders that is an average over a longer term and the number of shares repurchased and amount of free cash flow returned in any given period will vary and may be more or less than 40 in any such period finally the number of shares repurchased for a given amount of cash will vary based on ptc’s stock price so the number of shares repurchased will not be a consistent or predictable number or percentage of outstanding stock 

our stock price has been volatile which may make it harder to resell shares at a favorable time and price 

market prices for securities of software companies are generally volatile and are subject to significant fluctuations that may be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies the trading prices and valuations of these stocks and of ours may not be predictable negative changes in the public’s perception of the prospects of software companies or of ptc or the markets we serve could depress our stock price regardless of our operating results 

also a large percentage of our common stock is held by institutional investors purchases and sales of our common stock by these institutional investors could have a significant impact on the market price of the stock for more information about those investors please see our proxy statement with respect to our most recent annual meeting of stockholders and schedules 13d and 13g filed with the sec with respect to our common stock

our 2024 6 notes are not listed on any national securities exchange or included in any automated quotation system as a result an active market for the notes may not exist or be maintained which would adversely affect the market price and liquidity of the notes in that case holders may not be able to sell their notes at a particular time or at a favorable price 

the market for noninvestment grade debt historically has been subject to severe disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the notes the market if any for the notes may experience similar disruptions and any such disruptions may adversely affect the liquidity in that market or the prices at which the notes may be sold

executive overview 

2016 business developments 

subscription acceleration 

in 2016 we saw an acceleration in the adoption of subscription licensing by our customers including the conversion by some customers of their support contracts into subscriptions subscription bookings as a percentage of license and subscription bookings grew to 56 for 2016 up from 17 in 2015 and 8 in 2014 subscription bookings grew to 226 million in 2016 from 60 million in 2015 and 32 million in 2014 license and subscription bookings grew 16 in 2016 over 2015 with license and subscription bookings of 401 million in 2016 and grew 2 over 2014 our success with our subscription initiative contributed to the decline in both revenue including perpetual license revenue and earnings in 2016 

approximately 68 of our revenue in 2016 came from recurring revenue streams compared to 59 in 2015 and 53 in 2014 approximately 82 of our software revenue in 2016 came from recurring revenue streams compared to 73 in 2015 and 66 in 2014 

debt offering 

in may 2016 we issued 500 million of 60 senior unsecured longterm notes at par value due in 2024 the 2024 6 notes we used the net proceeds from the issuance of the notes to repay a portion of the outstanding revolving loan under our credit facility because the interest rate on the notes is higher than the variable rate we now pay under our credit facility our annual interest expense will increase by about 20 million the first interest payment on the notes is due in november 2016 

2016 restructuring of our workforce 

on october 23 2015 we initiated a plan to restructure our workforce and consolidate select facilities to reduce our cost structure to enable us to invest in our identified growth opportunities the restructuring resulted in charges of 37 million in the first quarter of 2016 5 million in the second quarter of 2016 3 million in the third quarter of 2016 and 32 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 primarily related to termination benefits associated with 810 employees we expect to complete facilityrelated restructuring actions in the first half of 2017 and to record approximately 3 million of charges associated with excess facilities 

acquisitions 

we closed two acquisitions in fiscal 2016 both of which enhanced our iot portfolio 

in november 2015 we acquired the vuforia business from qualcomm for approximately 65 million in cash at the time of the acquisition vuforia had approximately 80 employees and its historical annualized revenues were not material 

in january 2016 we acquired kepware inc a software development company that provides communications connectivity to industrial automation environments for approximately 99 million in cash and up to 18 million of contingent earnout at the time of the acquisition kepware had approximately 115 employees and historical annualized revenues of approximately 20 million 

results for 2016 

revenue was down year over year despite growth in license and subscription bookings due to 

 

we delivered strong growth in our iot group closing a number of significant deals with large industrial companies that are adopting our platform for their iot initiatives iot group software revenue represented approximately 8 of our total software revenue in 2016 compared to 5 in 2015 additionally although revenue declined year over year due to our subscription transition we had strong bookings growth in cad plm and slm 

from a geographic perspective total license and subscriptions bookings grew in all regions due to the higher mix of subscription bookings total software revenue in 2016 compared to 2015 decreased by 5 in the americas 6 on a constant currency basis in europe 7 on a constant currency basis in the pacific rim and 14 on a constant currency basis in japan 



gaap and nongaap operating income reflect lower revenue higher incentivebased compensation and costs from acquired businesses partially offset by reductions in operating expenses driven by cost savings from restructuring actions our gaap operating margin in 2016 included restructuring charges of 76 million our gaap operating margin in 2015 included a 66 million pension settlement loss due to the termination of our us pension plan a 28 million accrual associated with the china investigation and restructuring charges of 43 million both gaap and nongaap eps benefited from a lower tax rate 

in 2016 our gaap and nongaap results reflect a tax benefit of 4 million in 2016 related to the writeoff of a deferred tax liability that resulted from the change in tax status of a foreign subsidiary in 2015 our gaap results reflect a tax benefit of 19 million related to the reversal of a portion of the us valuation allowance related to reducing deferred tax assets in connection with settling the us pension plan 

we generated 183 million  of cash from operations in 2016 up 2  from 180 million  in 2015 and we borrowed 90 million  under our credit facility to fund acquisitions we ended 2016 with 278 million  of cash up from 273 million  at the end of 2015

the following table shows the financial measures that we consider the most significant indicators of the performance of our business in addition to providing operating income operating margin and diluted earnings per share as calculated under generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” it shows nongaap operating income nongaap operating margin and nongaap diluted earnings per share for the reported periods these nongaap financial measures exclude fair value adjustments related to acquired deferred revenue acquired deferred costs stockbased compensation expense amortization of acquired intangible assets expense acquisitionrelated and pension plan termination costs restructuring charges certain identified gains or charges included in nonoperating other income expense and the related tax effects of the preceding items as well as the tax items identified these nongaap financial measures provide investors another view of our operating results that is aligned with management budgets and with performance criteria in our incentive compensation plans management uses and investors should use nongaap financial measures in conjunction with our gaap results 

  



  



tax liabilities established for acquisitions recorded in 2014 and ii a tax charge of 35 million to establish valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets in two foreign jurisdictions 

future expectations strategies and risks   

our transition to a subscription model and continued economic uncertainty were headwinds for revenue and earnings growth in fiscal 2016 additionally our results have been impacted and we expect will continue to be impacted by our ability to close large transactions the amount of bookings and revenue particularly license and subscriptions attributable to large transactions and the number of such transactions may vary significantly from quarter to quarter based on customer purchasing decisions and macroeconomic conditions such transactions may have long lead times as they often follow a lengthy product selection and evaluation process and for existing customers are influenced by contract expiration cycles this may cause volatility in our results in addition we expect that deal sizes may decrease as we expect that customers will purchase more of our solutions as subscriptions which tend be smaller purchases than perpetual license purchases 

looking forward as we move into 2017 we have three overriding goals 

• focus on driving sustainable growth 

• continue to control costs and improve margins and 

• continue to expand our subscriptionbased licensing 

sustainable growth 

our goals for overall growth are predicated on continuing to grow in the iot market and continuing to drive improvements in operational performance in our core cad plm and slm solutions business 

subscription 

historically the majority of our software licenses were sold as perpetual licenses under which customers own the software license and revenue is recognized at the time of sale we began offering subscription licensing for our core solutions group products in 2015 and expanded our subscription program in 2016 under a subscription customers pay a periodic fee to license our software and access technical support over a specified period of time as part of our expanded subscription program we also launched a program for our existing customers to convert their support contracts to subscription contracts a number of customers converted their support contracts to subscriptions in 2016 and we expect there will be continued opportunities to convert existing support contracts to subscription contracts in 2017 and beyond due to the renewal cycles of certain of those contracts 

in 2016 56 of our bookings were sold as subscriptions compared to 17 in 2015 we expect that in 2017 a significant majority of our license and subscription bookings could be subscription the transition to a subscription licensing model has had and will continue to have an adverse impact on revenue operating margin and eps growth relative to periods in which we primarily sold perpetual licenses until the transition of our customer base to subscription is completed 

cost controls and margin expansion 

we continue to proactively manage our cost structure and invest in what we believe are high return opportunities in our business our goal is to drive continued margin expansion over the long term to that end we restructured our workforce in 2016 incurring charges of 76 million we expect to complete facilityrelated restructuring actions in the first half of 2017 and record approximately 3 million of charges associated with excess facilities in 2016 we made cash expenditures related to restructuring actions of 55 million we expect that the cost savings associated with the headcount and facility reductions will be offset by certain planned cost increases and investments in our business as a result we do not expect net operating expense reductions in 2017 as compared to 2016 levels 

results of operations 

acquisitions 

in 2016 we acquired vuforia on november 3 and kepware january 12 in 2015 we acquired coldlight on may 7 these acquisitions collectively added 248 million of revenue in 2016 and 17 million of revenue in 2015 

impact of foreign currency exchange on results of operations 

approximately two thirds of our revenue and half of our expenses are transacted in currencies other than the us dollar currency translation affects our reported results which are in us dollars changes in currency exchange rates particularly for the yen and the euro compared to the prior year decreased revenue and decreased expenses in 2016 and 2015 if actual reported results were converted into us dollars based on the corresponding prior year’s foreign currency exchange rates 2016 and 2015 revenue would have been higher by 244 million and 997 million respectively and expenses would have been 

higher by 241 million and 566 million respectively the net impact on yearoveryear results would have been an increase in operating income of 03 million in 2016 and an increase in operating income of 431 million in 2015 the results of operations revenue by line of business and revenue by geographic region in the tables that follow present both actual percentage changes year over year and percentage changes on a constant currency basis 

reclassifications 

in 2015 we classified revenue and cost of revenue in three categories 1 license and subscription 2 support and 3 professional services effective with the beginning of the first quarter of 2016 we are reporting perpetual license revenue separately from subscription revenue and are presenting revenue in four categories 1 subscription 2 support 3 perpetual license and 4 professional services effective with the beginning of the first quarter of 2016 we are combining cost of license and subscription revenue with cost of support revenue and reporting it as cost of software revenue as a result we are presenting cost of revenue in two categories 1 cost of software revenue and 2 cost of professional services revenue the discussion that follows reflects our revised reporting structure 

deferred revenue and backlog unbilled deferred revenue 

we define unbilled deferred revenue as contractually committed orders for license subscription and support with a customer for which the associated revenue has not been recognized and the customer has not been invoiced we do not record unbilled deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheet until we invoice the customer deferred revenue primarily relates to software agreements invoiced to customers for which the revenue has not yet been recognized 



of the unbilled deferred revenue balance at september 30 2016 we expect to invoice customers approximately 210 million within the next twelve months the increase in unbilled deferred revenue is primarily due to the increase in our subscription bookings which are generally billed annually at the start of each annual subscription period 

we expect that the amount of unbilled deferred revenue and deferred revenue will change from quarter to quarter for several reasons including the specific timing duration and size of large customer subscription and support agreements varying billing cycles of such agreements the specific timing of customer renewals foreign currency fluctuations and the timing of when unbilled deferred revenue is to be recognized as revenue 

revenue 

revenue is reported below by line of business subscription support perpetual license and professional services by product area solutions and iot groups and by geographic region americas europe pacific rim and japan results include combined revenue from direct sales and our channel 

revenue by line of business 





software revenue performance 

software revenue consists of subscription support and perpetual license revenue subscription revenue includes timebased licenses whereby customers use our software and receive related support for a specified term and for which revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the contract support revenue is composed of contracts to maintain new andor previously purchased perpetual licenses for which revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the contract perpetual licenses include a perpetual right to use the software for which revenue is generally recognized up front upon shipment to the customer 

solutions group 

the decline in software revenue in 2016 and 2015 compared to the prior year was driven primarily by a higher mix of subscription bookings as well as foreign currency rate changes and macroeconomic conditions 

iot group 

the iot group delivered revenue growth in 2016 and 2015 including from acquisitions revenue from kepware which we acquired on january 12 2016 totaled 161 million in 2016 and revenue from thingworx and axeda totaled 186 million and 325 million respectively in 2015 

professional services revenue 

consulting and training services engagements typically result from sales of new perpetual licenses and subscriptions particularly of our plm and slm solutions the decline in professional services revenue in 2016 was due in part to strong growth in bookings by our service partners which is in line with our strategy for professional services revenue to trend flattodown over time as we e xpand our service partner program under which service engagements are referred to third party service providers additionally over time we anticipate offering solutions that require less service as a result we do not expect that professional services revenue will increase proportionately with software revenue foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted professional services revenue by 59 million and 204 million in 2016 and 2015 respectively 

revenue by geographic region 

  



a significant percentage of our annual revenue comes from large customers in the broader manufacturing space as a result software revenue growth in our core cad and plm products historically has correlated to growth in broader measures of the global manufacturing economy including gdp industrial production and manufacturing pmi 

the decrease in revenue in 2016 compared to 2015 was driven primarily by a higher mix of subscription bookings as well as the impact of currency movements on reported revenue particularly the euro and the yen we believe that continued macroeconomic headwinds also contributed to a decrease in revenue performance year over year 

americas 

the decrease in revenue in americas in 2016 compared to 2015 consisted of decreases of 39 24 and 3 in perpetual license revenue professional services revenue and support revenue primarily plm respectively partially offset by an increase in subscription revenue of 58 

the decrease in revenue in americas in 2015 compared to 2014 consisted of decreases of 32 and 23 in perpetual license revenue and professional services revenue respectively partially offset by increases in subscription revenue and support revenue primarily plm of 128 and 6 respectively 

europe 

the decrease in revenue in europe in 2016 compared to 2015 consisted of decreases in perpetual license revenue of 46 43 on a constant currency basis and in support revenue of 6 1 on a constant currency basis partially offset by an increase in subscription revenue of 84 91 on a constant currency basis 

the decrease in revenue in europe in 2015 compared to 2014 consisted of decreases in perpetual license revenue of 26 13 on a constant currency basis in professional services revenue of 17 4 on a constant currency basis and in support revenue of 7 increase of 7 on a constant currency basis partially offset by an increase in subscription revenue of 150 185 on a constant currency basis 

yearoveryear changes in foreign currency exchange rates particularly the euro unfavorably impacted revenue in europe by 213 million and 736 million in 2016 and 2015 respectively 

pacific rim 

the decrease in revenue in pacific rim in 2016 compared to 2015 consisted of decreases in perpetual license revenue of 17 14 on a constant currency basis in professional services revenue of 14 10 on a constant currency basis and in support revenue of 9 5 on a constant currency basis partially offset by an increase in subscription revenue of 428 448 on a constant currency basis 

the decrease in revenue in pacific rim in 2015 compared to 2014 consisted of decreases in professional services revenue of 29 28 on a constant currency basis and in perpetual license revenue of 6 4 on a constant currency basis partially offset by increases in subscription revenue of 253 257 on a constant currency basis and in support revenue of 5 8 on a constant currency basis 

yearoveryear changes in foreign currency exchange rates unfavorably impacted revenue in pacific rim by 52 million and 32 million in 2016 and 2015 respectively 

in 2016 and 2015 compared to the prior year revenue in china decreased 18 and 14 respectively and represented 4 of total revenue in both years 

japan 

the decrease in revenue in japan in 2016 compared to 2015 consisted of decreases in perpetual license revenue of 55 54 on a constant currency basis and in professional services revenue of 5 11 on a constant currency basis partially offset by an increase in subscription revenue of 408 383 on a constant currency basis 

the decrease in revenue in japan in 2015 compared to 2014 consisted of decreases in support revenue of 10 increase of 5 on a constant currency basis and in perpetual license revenue of 5 increase of 12 on a constant currency basis partially offset by increases in subscription revenue of 572 637 on a constant currency basis and in professional services revenue of 15 34 on a constant currency basis 

yearoveryear changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted revenue in japan by 50 million in 2016 and unfavorably impacted revenue in japan by 192 million in 2015 

gross margin 



gross margin as a percentage of total revenue in 2016 compared to 2015 reflects lower software margins due to lower perpetual license revenue support revenue comprised 57  of our total revenue in 2016 compared to 54  in 2015 and 51  in 2014 

gross margin as a percentage of total revenue in 2015 compared to 2014 reflects lower software margins due to lower perpetual license revenue and a higher mix of cloud services revenue due to our acquisition of axeda which has lower margins than license revenue 

costs and expenses 

  





  



 2016 compared to 2015 

costs and expenses in 2016 compared to 2015 decreased primarily as a result of the following 

 the decreases above were partially offset by increases due to 

 

2015 compared to 2014 

costs and expenses in 2015 compared to 2014 increased primarily as a result of the following 

 these cost increases were partially offset by 

 cost of software revenue 



our cost of software revenue consists of fixed and variable costs associated with reproducing and distributing software and documentation as well as royalties paid to third parties for technology embedded in or licensed with our software products amortization of intangible assets associated with acquired products and costs to perform and support our cloud services business our cost of software revenue also includes costs such as salaries benefits information technology and facilities associated with customer support and the release of support updates including related royalty costs cost of software revenue as a percent of software revenue can vary depending on product mix sold the effect of fixed and variable royalties and the level of amortization of acquired software intangible assets amortization of acquired purchased software totaled 246 million 194 million and 181 million in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively total compensation benefits costs and travel expenses increased by 82 million from 2015 to 2016 and by 09 million from 2014 to 2015 

cost of professional services revenue 



our cost of professional services revenue includes costs such as salaries benefits information technology costs and facilities expenses for our training and consulting personnel and thirdparty subcontractor fees 

in 2016 compared to 2015 total compensation benefit costs and travel expenses decreased by 248 million the cost of thirdparty consulting services was 26 million lower in 2016 compared to 2015 

in 2015 compared to 2014 total compensation benefit costs and travel expenses decreased 21 369 million primarily due to reduced headcount additionally the cost of thirdparty consulting services was 74 million lower in 2015 compared to 2014 

the decreases in 2016 and 2015 compared to the prior years in the cost of thirdparty consulting services is a result of our strategy to have our strategic services partners perform services for customers directly which has contributed to lower revenue and improving services margins as a result of decreases in professional services revenue in 2016 and 2015 compared to the prior year we have reduced headcount resulting in lower compensationrelated costs 

sales and marketing 



our sales and marketing expenses primarily include salaries and benefits sales commissions advertising and marketing programs travel information technology costs and facility expenses 

our compensation benefit costs and travel expenses were higher by an aggregate of 5 144 million in 2016 compared to 2015 which reflects lower salaries offset by higher incentivebased compensation including commissions due primarily to higher than planned subscription bookings and increased headcount 

 our compensation benefit costs and travel expenses were lower by an aggregate of 7 203 million in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to lower headcount 

research and development 



our research and development expenses consist principally of salaries and benefits information technology costs and facility expenses major research and development activities include developing new releases of our software and releases and updates of our software that enhance functionality and add features 

total compensation benefit costs and travel expenses were higher by 2 43 million in 2016 compared to 2015 the decrease in research and development headcount from 2015 to 2016 reflects restructuring actions offset by approximately 132 employees added from businesses acquired after the second quarter of 2015 

total compensation benefit costs and travel expenses were lower by 1 19 million in 2015 compared to 2014 

general and administrative ga 



our ga expenses include the costs of our corporate finance information technology human resources legal and administrative functions as well as acquisitionrelated charges bad debt expense and outside professional services including accounting and legal fees acquisitionrelated costs include direct costs of acquisitions and expenses related to acquisition integration activities including transaction fees due diligence costs retention bonuses and severance and professional fees including legal and accounting costs related to the acquisition in addition subsequent adjustments to our initial estimated amount of contingent consideration associated with specific acquisitions are included in acquisitionrelated charges acquisitionrelated charges and pension plan terminationrelated costs included in ga were 35 million 158 million and 131 million in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively additionally as described below we recorded a pension settlement loss of 663 million in 2015 such loss is not included in ga the decrease in overall general and administrative costs in 2016 compared to 2015 was due primarily to an increase in performancebased bonus and stockbased compensation due in part to a modification of performancebased awards previously granted under our longterm incentive programs of 237 million offset by the 282 million accrual recorded in 2015 related to the settlement of the china investigation 

the increase in overall general and administrative costs in 2015 compared to 2014 was due primarily to the 282 million reserve recorded related to the settlement of the china investigation  

us pension settlement loss 

us pension settlement loss reflects the loss recognized in the fourth quarter of 2015 related to the termination of our us pension plan due to the amortization of actuarial losses previously recorded in equity 

amortization of acquired intangible assets 



amortization of acquired intangible assets reflects the amortization of acquired nonproduct related intangible assets primarily customer and trademarkrelated intangible assets recorded in connection with completed acquisitions the decrease in amortization of acquired intangible assets from 2015 to 2016 is due to certain intangibles becoming fully amortized partially offset by an increase in amortization related to recent acquisitions the increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets in 2015 compared to 2014 includes our acquisitions of coldlight in the third quarter of 2015 axeda and atego in the fourth quarter of 2014 and our acquisition of thingworx in the second quarter of 2014 

restructuring charges   



restructuring charges for 2016 were 763 million 769 million related to the plan announced in october 2015 described below offset by a 06 million credit related to prior year restructuring actions 

our 2016 restructuring actions resulted in a charge of 769 million in 2016 including 11 million of facility related charges and 758 million of employee related termination costs primarily related to termination benefits associated with 810 employees in 2016 we completed planned headcount reductions and we expect to complete facilityrelated restructuring actions in the first half of 2017 and record approximately 3 million of charges associated with excess facilities we expect that the cost savings associated with the headcount and facility reductions will be offset by certain planned cost increases and investments in our business as a result we do not expect net operating expense reductions in 2017 as compared to 2016 levels 

our 2015 restructuring was undertaken to enable us to increase investment in our iot business and to reduce our cost structure through organizational efficiencies in the face of significant foreign currency depreciation relative to the us dollar and a more cautious outlook on global macroeconomic conditions the restructuring actions resulted in charges of 434 million during 2015 including 14 million of facility related charges and 420 million of employeerelated termination costs primarily related to termination benefits associated with 411 employees this reorganization resulted in net annualized expense reductions of approximately 30 million 

our 2014 restructuring in support of integrating businesses acquired in the prior year and the continued evolution of our business model resulted in a charge of 268 million attributable to termination benefits associated with 283 employees which benefits were primarily paid in fiscal 2015 this restructuring action resulted in annualized cost savings of approximately 30 million in addition in 2014 we recorded restructuring charges of 16 million primarily associated with the completion of the restructuring actions initiated in the fourth quarter of 2013 

in 2016 2015 and 2014 we made cash payments related to restructuring charges of 550 million 536 million and 206 million respectively at september 30 2016 accrued expenses for unpaid restructuring charges totaled 366 million which we expect to pay within the next twelve months 

nonoperating income expense 



foreign currency net losses foreign currency net losses include costs of hedging contracts certain realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains or losses and foreign exchange gains or losses resulting from the required periodend currency remeasurement of the assets and liabilities of our subsidiaries that use the us dollar as their functional currency because a large portion of our revenue and expenses is transacted in foreign currencies we engage in hedging transactions involving the use of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 

interest income interest income represents earnings on the investment of our available cash balances and interest on financing provided to customers as described in note b summary of significant accounting policies  of notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report 

interest expense the increase in interest expense in 2016 compared to 2015 was due to higher amounts outstanding under our credit facility and the issuance of the 2024 6 notes we had 758 million total debt at september 30 2016 compared to 668 million at september 30 2015 

we used the net proceeds from the issuance of the notes to repay a portion of our outstanding revolving loan under our credit facility because the interest rate on the notes is higher than the variable rate we now pay under our credit facility our annual interest expense will increase by about 20 million 

we had 668 million outstanding under the credit facility at september 30 2015 compared to 612 million at september 30 2014 including 295 million borrowed in the fourth quarter of 2014 to fund our acquisition of axeda and to fund an accelerated share repurchase program the balance outstanding at september 30 2015 reflects amounts borrowed in 2015 as a result of our acquisition of coldlight 

the average interest rate on amounts outstanding under the credit facility was 30  in 2016 17  in 2015 and 16  in 2014 

other income expense net there were no significant changes to other income expense which is primarily made up other nonoperating gains and losses 

income taxes 

tax provision and effective income tax rates 



in 2016 and 2015 our effective tax rate was lower than the 35  statutory federal income tax rate due in large part to our corporate structure in which our foreign taxes are at an effective tax rate lower than the us a significant amount of our foreign earnings is generated by our subsidiaries organized in ireland and in 2016 2015 and 2014 the foreign rate differential predominantly relates to these irish earnings our foreign rate differential in 2016 and 2015 includes the continuing rate benefit from a business realignment completed on september 30 2014 in which intellectual property was transferred between two whollyowned foreign subsidiaries the realignment allows us to more efficiently manage the distribution of our software to european customers in 2016 and 2015 this realignment resulted in a tax benefit of approximately 28 million  and 24 million  respectively in fiscal 2017 we expect this realignment to result in a tax benefit of approximately 25 million in 2016 the change in valuation allowance primarily relates to us losses not benefitted as well as the release of valuation allowance totaling 31 million  in two foreign subsidiaries our provision also reflects a 60 million  tax benefit related to a us research and development tax credit which was offset by a corresponding provision to increase our us valuation allowance 

additionally in 2015 us permanent items include the tax effect of a 145 million expense related to the settlement of the china investigation other factors that impacted the 2015 effective tax rate included the release of a valuation allowance totaling 187 million  relating to the us pension plan termination foreign withholding taxes of 38 million  a tax benefit of 31 million  relating to the reassessment of our reserve requirements and a benefit of 14 million  in conjunction with the reorganization of our atego us subsidiaries additionally our 2015 provision reflected a 21 million  tax benefit related to a retroactive extension of the us research and development tax credit enacted in the first quarter of 2015 this benefit was offset by a corresponding provision to increase our us valuation allowance 

in 2014 our effective tax rate was lower than the 35  statutory federal income tax rate due in large part to the reversal of a portion of the valuation allowance against us deferred tax assets we recorded benefits resulting from 2014 acquisitions as described below other factors that impacted the rate include foreign withholding taxes of 51 million  and the establishment of a valuation allowance totaling 35 million  in two foreign subsidiaries 

acquisitions in 2014 were accounted for as business combinations assets acquired including the fair value of acquired tangible assets intangible assets and assumed liabilities were recorded and we recorded net deferred tax liabilities of 216 million  in 2014 primarily related to the tax effect of acquired intangible assets that are not deductible for income tax purposes these deferred tax liabilities reduced our net deferred tax asset balance and resulted in a tax benefit of 181 million  in 2014 to decrease our valuation allowance in jurisdictions where we have recorded a valuation allowance primarily the us as these decreases in the valuation allowance are not part of the accounting for business combinations the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed they were recorded as an income tax benefit 

valuation allowance 

we have concluded based on the weight of available evidence that a full valuation allowance continues to be required against our us net deferred tax assets as they are not more likely than not to be realized in the future we will continue to reassess whether a valuation allowance is required each financial reporting period 

tax audits and examinations 

in the normal course of business ptc and its subsidiaries are examined by various taxing authorities including the internal revenue service irs in the united states we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate we are currently under audit by tax authorities in several jurisdictions audits by tax authorities typically involve examination of the deductibility of certain permanent items limitations on net operating losses and tax credits although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in material changes in our estimates 

our future effective income tax rate 

our future effective income tax rate may be materially impacted by the amount of income taxes associated with our foreign earnings which are taxed at rates different from the us federal statutory income tax rate as well as the timing and extent of the realization of deferred tax assets and changes in the tax law further our tax rate may fluctuate within a fiscal year including from quarter to quarter due to items arising from discrete events including settlements of tax audits and assessments the resolution or identification of tax position uncertainties and acquisitions of other companies 

bookings measure 

we offer both perpetual and subscription licensing options to our customers as well as monthly software rentals for certain products given the difference in revenue recognition between the sale of a perpetual software license revenue is recognized at the time of sale and a subscription revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the subscription term we use bookings for internal planning forecasting and reporting of new license and cloud services transactions in order to normalize between perpetual and subscription licenses we define subscription bookings as the subscription annualized contract value subscription acv of new subscription bookings multiplied by a conversion factor of 2 we arrived at the conversion factor of 2 by considering a number of variables including pricing support length of term and renewal rates we define subscription acv as the total value of a new subscription booking divided by the term of the contract in days multiplied by 365 if the term of the subscription contract is less than a year the acv is equal to the total contract value in 2016 the weighted average contract length of our subscription bookings was approximately 2 years 

license and subscription bookings equal subscription bookings as described above plus perpetual license bookings plus any monthly software rental bookings during the period total acv equals subscription acv as described above plus the annualized value of incremental monthly software rental bookings during the period 

because subscription bookings is a metric we use to approximate the value of subscription sales if sold as perpetual licenses it does not represent the actual revenue that will be recognized with respect to subscription sales or that would be recognized if the sales were perpetual licenses nor does the annualized value of monthly software rental bookings represent the value of any such booking 

nongaap financial measures 

the nongaap financial measures presented in the discussion of our results of operations and the respective most directly comparable gaap measures are 

 the nongaap financial measures exclude fair value adjustments related to acquired deferred revenue and deferred costs stockbased compensation expense amortization of acquired intangible assets expense acquisitionrelated charges pension plan terminationrelated costs a legal settlement accrual restructuring charges nonoperating credit facility refinancing costs identified discrete charges included in nonoperating other expense net and the related tax effects of the preceding items and any other identified tax items 

these items are normally included in the comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with gaap our management excludes these items when evaluating our ongoing performance andor predicting our earnings trends and therefore excludes them when presenting nongaap financial measures management uses nongaap financial measures in conjunction with our gaap results as should investors 

fair value of acquired deferred revenue is a purchase accounting adjustment recorded to reduce acquired deferred revenue to the fair value of the remaining obligation so our gaap revenue after an acquisition does not reflect the full amount of revenue that would have been reported if the acquired deferred revenue was not written down to fair value we believe excluding these adjustments to revenue from these contracts and associated costs in fair value adjustment to deferred services cost  is useful to investors as an additional means to assess revenue trends of our business    

stockbased compensation is a noncash expense relating to stockbased awards issued to executive officers employees and outside directors consisting of restricted stock stock options and restricted stock units we exclude this expense as it is a noncash expense and we assess our internal operations excluding this expense and believe it facilitates comparisons to the performance of other companies in our industry 

amortization of acquired intangible assets is a noncash expense that is impacted by the timing and magnitude of our acquisitions we believe the assessment of our operations excluding these costs is relevant to our assessment of internal operations and comparisons to the performance of other companies in our industry 

acquisitionrelated charges included in general and administrative costs are   direct costs of potential and completed acquisitions and expenses related to acquisition integration activities including transaction fees due diligence costs severance and professional fees in addition subsequent adjustments to our initial estimated amount of contingent consideration associated with specific acquisitions are also included within acquisitionrelated charges the occurrence and amount of these costs will vary depending on the timing and size of acquisitions 

us pension plan terminationrelated costs include charges related to our plan that we began terminating in the second quarter of 2014 costs associated with termination of the plan are not considered part of our regular operations 

legal accrual includes amounts accrued to settle our sec and doj fcpa investigation in china which was ultimately settled and paid in the second quarter of 2016 for 282 million and other amounts in respect of related regulatory and other matters we view these matters as nonordinary course events and exclude the amounts when reviewing our operating performance 

restructuring charges include severance costs and excess facility restructuring charges resulting from reductions of personnel driven by modifications to our business strategy these costs may vary in size based on our restructuring plan 

nonoperating credit facility refinancing costs  are nonoperating charges we record as a result of the refinancing of our credit facility we assess our internal operations excluding these costs and believe it facilitates comparisons to the performance of other companies in our industry 

income tax adjustments include the tax impact of the items above and assumes that we are profitable on a nongaap basis in the us and one foreign jurisdiction and eliminates the effect of the valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets in those jurisdictions additionally we exclude other material tax items that we view as nonordinary course 

we use these nongaap financial measures and we believe that they assist our investors to make periodtoperiod comparisons of our operational performance because they provide a view of our operating results without items that are not in our view indicative of our core operating results we believe that these nongaap financial measures help illustrate underlying trends in our business and we use the measures to establish budgets and operational goals communicated internally and externally for managing our business and evaluating our performance we believe that providing nongaap financial measures affords investors a view of our operating results that may be more easily compared to the results of peer companies 

the items excluded from the nongaap financial measures often have a material impact on our financial results and such items often recur accordingly the nongaap financial measures included in this annual report should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for or superior to the comparable measures prepared in accordance with gaap the following tables reconcile each of these nongaap financial measures to its most closely comparable gaap measure on our financial statements   





  



critical accounting policies and estimates 

we have prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america in preparing our financial statements we make estimates assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our reported revenues results of operations and net income as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet these estimates assumptions and judgments are necessary because future events and their effects on our results and the value of our assets cannot be determined with certainty and are made based on our historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances these estimates may change as new events occur or additional information is obtained and we may periodically be faced with uncertainties the outcomes of which are not within our control and may not be known for a prolonged period of time 

the accounting policies methods and estimates used to prepare our financial statements are described generally in note b summary of significant accounting policies  of “notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report the most important accounting judgments and estimates that we made in preparing the financial statements involved 



a critical accounting policy is one that is both material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires us to make subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies require us to make assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time of the estimate and different estimates that we could have used or changes in the estimates that are reasonably likely to occur may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process actual results could differ from those estimates 

accounting policies guidelines and interpretations related to our critical accounting policies and estimates are generally subject to numerous sources of authoritative guidance and are often reexamined by accounting standards rule makers and regulators these rule makers andor regulators may promulgate interpretations guidance or regulations that may result in changes to our accounting policies which could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 

revenue recognition 

our sources of revenue include 1 subscription 2 support 3 perpetual license and 4 professional services we record revenues for software related deliverables in accordance with the guidance provided by asc 985605 softwarerevenue recognition and revenues for nonsoftware deliverables in accordance with   asc 60525  revenue recognition multipleelement arrangements when the following criteria are met 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 2 delivery has occurred generally fob shipping point or electronic distribution 3 the fee is fixed or determinable and 4 collection is probable we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with determining the amounts of software license and services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period our primary judgments involve the following 

 our software is distributed primarily through our direct sales force in addition we have an indirect distribution channel through alliances with resellers revenue arrangements with resellers are generally recognized on a sellthrough basis that is when we deliver the product to the enduser customer we record consideration given to a reseller as a reduction of revenue to the extent we have recorded revenue from the reseller we do not offer contractual rights of return stock balancing or price protection to our resellers and actual product returns from them have been insignificant to date as a result we do not maintain reserves for reseller product returns 

at the time of each sale transaction we must make an assessment of the collectability of the amount due from the customer revenue is only recognized at that time if management deems that collection is probable in making this assessment we consider customer creditworthiness and historical payment experience at that same time we assess whether fees are fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties in assessing whether the fee is fixed or determinable we consider the payment terms of the transaction including transactions with payment terms that extend beyond our customary payment terms and our collection experience in similar transactions without making concessions among other factors we have periodically provided financing to creditworthy customers with payment terms up to 24 months if the fee is determined not to be fixed or determinable revenue is recognized only as payments become due from the customer provided that all other revenue recognition criteria are met our software license arrangements generally do not include customer acceptance provisions however if an arrangement includes an acceptance provision we record revenue only upon the earlier of 1 receipt of written acceptance from the customer or 2 expiration of the acceptance period 

generally our contracts are accounted for individually however when contracts are closely interrelated and dependent on each other it may be necessary to account for two or more contracts as one to reflect the substance of the group of contracts 

subscription 

subscription revenue includes revenue from two primary sources 1 subscriptionbased licenses and 2 cloud services 

subscriptionbased licenses include the right for a customer to use our licenses which may be on premise or in the cloud and receive related support for a specified term and revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement when sold in arrangements with other elements vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” of fair value is established for the subscriptionbased licenses through the use of a substantive renewal clause within the customer contract for a combined annual fee that includes the termbased license and related support 

cloud services reflect recurring revenues that include fees for hosting and application management of customers’ perpetual or subscriptionbased licenses generally customers have the right to terminate the cloud services contract and take 

possession of the licenses without a significant penalty when cloud services are sold as part of a multielement transaction revenue is allocated to cloud services based on vsoe and recognized ratably over the contractual term beginning on the commencement dates of each contract which is the date the services are made available to the customer vsoe is established for cloud services either through a substantive stated renewal option or stated contractual overage rates as these rates represent the value the customer is willing to pay on a standalone basis we also offer cloud services under saas arrangements whereby customers access our software in the cloud under saas arrangements customers are not entitled to terminate the cloud services and cannot take possession of the software cloud services include setup fees which are recognized ratably over the contract term or the expected customer life whichever is longer 

support 

support contracts generally include rights to unspecified upgrades when and if available telephone and internetbased support updates and bug fixes support revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the support contract on a straightline basis 

perpetual license 

under perpetual license arrangements we generally recognize license revenue up front upon shipment to the customer we use the residual method to recognize revenue from perpetual license software arrangements that include one or more elements to be delivered at a future date when evidence of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists and the elements of the arrangement qualify for separate accounting as described below under the residual method the fair value of the undelivered elements ie support and services based on our vsoe of fair value is deferred and the remaining portion of the total arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements ie perpetual software license if evidence of the fair value of one or more of the undelivered elements does not exist all revenues are deferred and recognized when delivery of all of those elements has occurred or when fair values can be established we determine vsoe of the fair value of services and support revenue based upon our recent pricing for those elements when sold separately for certain transactions vsoe is determined based on a substantive renewal clause within a customer contract our current pricing practices are influenced primarily by product type purchase volume sales channel and customer location we review services and support sold separately on a periodic basis and update when appropriate our vsoe of fair value for such elements to ensure that it reflects our recent pricing experience 

professional services 

our software arrangements often include implementation consulting and training services that are sold under consulting engagement contracts or as part of the software license arrangement when we determine that such services are not essential to the functionality of the licensed software we record revenue separately for the license and service elements of these arrangements provided that appropriate evidence of fair value exists for the undelivered services ie vsoe of fair value we consider various factors in assessing whether a service is not essential to the functionality of the software including if the services may be provided by independent third parties experienced in providing such services ie consulting and implementation in coordination with dedicated customer personnel and whether the services result in significant modification or customization of the software’s functionality when professional services qualify for separate accounting professional services revenues under time and materials billing arrangements are recognized as the services are performed professional services revenues under fixedpriced contracts are generally recognized as the services are performed using a proportionate performance model with hours or costs as the input method of attribution 

when we provide professional services that are considered essential to the functionality of the software the arrangement does not qualify for separate accounting of the license and service elements and the license revenue is recognized together with the consulting services using the percentageofcompletion method of contract accounting under such arrangements consideration is recognized as the services are performed as measured by an observable input in these circumstances we separate license revenue from service revenue for income statement presentation by allocating vsoe of fair value of the consulting services as service revenue and the residual portion as license revenue under the percentageofcompletion method we estimate the stage of completion of contracts with fixed or “not to exceed” fees based on hours or costs incurred to date as compared with estimated total project hours or costs at completion adjustments to estimates to complete are made in the periods in which facts resulting in a change become known when total cost estimates exceed revenues we accrue for the estimated losses when identified the use of the proportionate performance and percentageofcompletion methods of accounting require significant judgment relative to estimating total contract costs or hours hours being a proxy for costs including assumptions relative to the length of time to complete the project the nature and complexity of the work to be performed and anticipated changes in salaries and other costs 

reimbursements of outofpocket expenditures incurred in connection with providing consulting services are included in professional services revenue with the offsetting expense recorded in cost of professional services revenue 

training services include onsite and classroom training training revenues are recognized as the related training services are provided 

accounting for income taxes 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to calculate our income tax expense based on taxable income by jurisdiction there are many transactions and calculations about which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain as a result our calculations involve estimates by management some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenuesharing costreimbursement and transfer pricing arrangements among related entities and the differing tax treatment of revenue and cost items across various jurisdictions if we were compelled to revise or to account differently for our arrangements that revision could affect our tax liability 

the income tax accounting process also involves estimating our actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheets we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized we must establish a valuation allowance as a charge to income tax expense 

as of september 30 2016 we have a valuation allowance of 2090 million  against net deferred tax assets in the us and a valuation allowance of 265 million  against net deferred tax assets in certain foreign jurisdictions we have concluded based on the weight of available evidence that a full valuation allowance continues to be required against our us net deferred tax assets as they are not more likely than not to be realized in the future we will continue to reassess our valuation allowance requirements each financial reporting period 

the valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets of certain foreign jurisdictions is established primarily for our net operating loss carryforwards the majority of which do not expire there are limitations imposed on the utilization of such net operating losses that could further restrict the recognition of any tax benefits 

we have not provided for us income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on foreign unrepatriated earnings as it is our current intention to permanently reinvest these earnings outside the us unless it can be done with no significant tax cost with the exception of a foreign holding company formed in 2014 in 2016 we incurred us tax expense of 12 million  on the repatriation of the 2016 earnings of this foreign holding company this expense was offset by a change in the valuation allowance if we decide to change this assertion in the future to repatriate any additional nonus earnings we may be required to establish a deferred tax liability on such earnings the cumulative basis difference associated with the undistributed earnings of our subsidiaries totaled approximately 789 million  and 684 million  as of september 30 2016  and 2015  respectively the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability on the undistributed earnings cannot be practicably determined at this time if we decide to change this assertion in the future to repatriate any additional nonus earnings we may be required to establish a deferred tax liability on such earnings 

in the normal course of business ptc and its subsidiaries are examined by various taxing authorities including the internal revenue service irs in the united states we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate we are currently under audit by tax authorities in several jurisdictions audits by tax authorities typically involve examination of the deductibility of certain permanent items limitations on net operating losses and tax credits although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in material changes in our estimates 

valuation of assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations 

in accordance with business combination accounting we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values determining these fair values requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets 

our identifiable intangible assets acquired consist of developed technology core technology tradenames customer lists and contracts and software support agreements and related relationships developed technology consists of products that have reached technological feasibility core technology represents a combination of processes inventions and trade secrets related to the design and development of acquired products customer lists and contracts and software support agreements and related relationships represent the underlying relationships and agreements with customers of the acquired company’s installed base we have generally valued intangible assets using a discounted cash flow model critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to 



 in addition we estimate the useful lives of our intangible assets based upon the expected period over which we anticipate generating economic benefits from the related intangible asset 

net tangible assets consist of the fair values of tangible assets less the fair values of assumed liabilities and obligations except for deferred revenues net tangible assets were generally valued by us at the respective carrying amounts recorded by the acquired company if we believed that their carrying values approximated their fair values at the acquisition date the values assigned to deferred revenue reflect an amount equivalent to the estimated cost plus an appropriate profit margin to perform the services related to the acquired company’s software support contracts 

in addition uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date and we reevaluate these items quarterly with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill provided that we are within the measurement period up to one year from the acquisition date and we continue to collect information in order to determine their estimated values subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the estimated value of uncertain tax positions or tax related valuation allowances whichever comes first changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of operations 

our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable at that time but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions estimates or actual results 

when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a finitelived intangible asset may not be recoverable we perform an assessment of the asset for potential impairment this assessment is based on projected undiscounted future cash flows over the asset’s remaining life if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its undiscounted cash flows we record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset determined using projected discounted future cash flows of the asset 

valuation of goodwill 

our goodwill totaled 11698 million and 10690 million  as of september 30 2016 and 2015 respectively we assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level our reporting units are determined based on the components of our operating segments that constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and for which operating results are regularly reviewed by segment management our reporting units are consistent with our operating segments through the second quarter of 2016 we had two operating and reportable segments 1 software products and 2 services with a change in our organizational structure in an effort to create more effective and efficient operations and to improve customer and product focus in the third quarter of 2016 we revised the information that our chief executive officer who is also our chief operating decision maker “codm” regularly reviews for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance as a result effective in the third quarter of 2016 we changed our operating and reportable segments from two to three 1 the solutions group 2 the iot group and 3 professional services 

as of september 30 2016  goodwill and acquired intangible assets in the aggregate attributable to our solutions group iot group and professional services segment was 11966 million  2528 million  and 307 million  respectively as of september 30 2015 goodwill and acquired intangible assets in the aggregate attributable to our software products reportable segment and our services reportable segment was 12979 million  and 624 million  respectively we test goodwill for impairment in the third quarter of our fiscal year or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting segment below its carrying value factors we consider important on an overall company basis and reportable segment basis as applicable that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results significant changes in our use of the acquired assets or a significant change in the strategy for our business significant negative industry or economic trends a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period or a reduction of our market capitalization relative to net book value 

 we completed our annual goodwill impairment review as of july 2 2016  and concluded that no impairment charge was required as of that date to conduct our test of goodwill the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value if the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value we record an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value of goodwill and its implied fair value we estimate the fair values of our reporting units using discounted cash flow valuation models those models require estimates of future revenues profits capital expenditures working capital 

terminal values based on revenue multiples and discount rates for each reporting unit we estimate these amounts by evaluating historical trends current budgets operating plans and industry data the estimated fair value of each reporting unit was at least approximately twice its carrying value as of july 2 2016  

accounting for pensions 

we sponsor several international pension plans we make assumptions that are used in calculating the expense and liability of these plans these key assumptions include the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate used to determine the present value of benefit obligations in selecting the expected longterm rate of return on assets we consider the average future rate of earnings expected on the funds invested to provide for the benefits under the pension plan this includes considering the plans asset allocations and the expected returns likely to be earned over the life of the plans the discount rate reflects the estimated rate at which an amount that is invested in a portfolio of highquality debt instruments would provide the future cash flows necessary to pay benefits when they come due the actuarial assumptions used by us may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions or longer or shorter life spans of the participants our actual results could differ materially from those we estimated which could require us to record a greater amount of pension expense in future years andor require higher than expected cash contributions 

accounting and reporting for these plans requires the use of countryspecific assumptions for discount rates and expected rates of return on assets we apply a consistent methodology in determining the key assumptions that in addition to future experience assumptions such as mortality rates are used by our actuaries to determine our liability and expense for each of these plans the discount rate for germany was selected with reference to a spotrate yield curve based on the yields of aarated eurodenominated corporate bonds in addition our actuarial consultants determine the expense and liabilities of the plan using other assumptions for future experience such as mortality rates in determining our pension cost for 2016 2015 and 2014 we used weighted average discount rates of 22  24  and 33  respectively and weighted average expected returns on plan assets of 57  58  and 57  respectively in 2016  2015 and 2014 our actual return loss on plan assets was 17 million  04 million and 35 million respectively if actual returns are below our expected rates of return it will impact the amount and timing of future contributions and expense for these plans 

as of september 30 2016 and 2015 our plans in total were underfunded representing the difference between our projected benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets by 308 million  and 202 million  respectively the projected benefit obligation as of september 30 2016 was determined using a weighted average discount rate of 13  the most sensitive assumptions used in calculating the expense and liability of our pension plans are the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets total gaap net periodic pension cost was 20 million  in 2016 and we expect it to be approximately 27 million  in 2017 a 50 basis point change to our discount rate and expected return on plan assets assumptions would have changed our pension expense for the year ended september 30 2016 by less than 1 million a 50 basis point decrease in our discount rate assumptions would increase our projected benefit obligation as of september 30 2015 by approximately 8 million 

legal contingencies 

we are periodically subject to various legal claims and involved in various legal proceedings we routinely review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any matter is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we record a liability for the estimated loss significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether the amount of an exposure is reasonably estimable because of inherent uncertainties related to these legal matters we base our loss accruals on the best information available at the time further estimates of this nature are highly subjective and the final outcome of these matters could vary significantly from the amounts that have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as additional information becomes available we reassess our potential liability and may revise our estimates such revisions could have a material impact on future quarterly or annual results of operations 

liquidity and capital resources 

  



cash and cash equivalents 

we invest our cash with highly rated financial institutions and in diversified domestic and international money market mutual funds cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less in addition we hold investments in marketable securities totaling approximately 496 million  with average maturity of 18 months at september 30 2016  cash and cash equivalents totaled 2779 million  up from 2734 million  at september 30 2015 reflecting 1832 million  in operating cash flow 900 million  of net amounts borrowed under our credit facility and debt issuance partially offset by 1658 million  used to acquire vuforia and kepware 452 million  used for the purchase of investment grade securities 262 million  used for capital expenditures and 209 million  used to pay withholding taxes on stockbased awards that vested in the period 

cash provided by operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities was 1832 million  in 2016 compared to 1799 million  in 2015 and 3046 million  in 2014 cash provided by operations in 2016 reflects lower contributions to pension plans 447 million lower in 2016 compared to 2015 offset by 282 million paid to resolve the china investigation and lower earnings restructuring payments totaled 550 million  in 2016 compared to 536 million  in 2015 and 206 million  in 2014 cash paid for income taxes was 255 million  301 million  and 255 million  in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively 

we periodically provide financing with payment terms up to 24 months to creditworthy customers the accompanying consolidated balance sheets include receivables from customers related to extended payment term contracts totaling 71 million  and 274 million  at september 30 2016 and 2015 respectively we periodically transfer future payments under customer contracts to thirdparty financial institutions on a nonrecourse basis we did not sell any receivables in 2016  compared to 30 million  in 2015  and 245 million  in 2014

credit agreement 

in november 2015 we entered into a multicurrency credit facility with a syndicate of sixteen banks for which jpmorgan chase bank na acts as administrative agent we amended the credit facility in june and september 2016 to decrease the revolving loan commitment from 1 billion to 900 million and to make additional adjustments 

we use the credit facility for general corporate purposes including acquisitions of businesses share repurchases and working capital requirements as of september 30 2016 we had 2581 million  in revolving loans outstanding under the credit facility the fair value of which approximated its book value in november 2016 we borrowed 60 million under our credit facility to fund working capital requirements including 2016 year end incentivebased compensation accruals after such borrowing we had approximately 318 million outstanding under the credit facility with approximately 582 million undrawn of which only approximately 40 million would be available to borrow due to covenant limitations 

the revolving loan commitment does not require amortization of principal and may be repaid in whole or in part before the scheduled maturity date at our option without penalty or premium the credit facility matures on september 15 2019 when all remaining amounts outstanding will be due and payable in full 

any borrowings by ptc inc or certain of our foreign subsidiaries under the credit facility would be guaranteed respectively by our material domestic subsidiaries that become parties to the subsidiary guaranty if any andor by ptc inc borrowings are also secured by first priority liens on property of ptc and certain of our material domestic subsidiaries including 100 of the voting equity interests of certain of our domestic subsidiaries and 65 of our material firsttier foreign subsidiaries loans under the credit facility bear interest at variable rates that reset every 30 to 180 days depending on the rate and period selected by us and based upon our total leverage ratio during 2016 the weighted average annual interest rate for borrowings outstanding was 30 and as of september 30 2016 the rate on the credit facility was 256  

the credit facility imposes customary covenants that limit our ability to incur liens or guarantee obligations pay dividends and make other distributions make investments and engage in certain other transactions in addition we and our material domestic subsidiaries may not invest in or loan to our foreign subsidiaries in aggregate amounts exceeding 75 million for any purpose and an additional 200 million for acquisitions of businesses we also must maintain the following financial ratios 



      any failure to comply with such covenants would prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds and would constitute a default permitting the lenders to among other things accelerate the amounts outstanding and terminate the credit facility as of september 30 2016 we were in compliance with all financial and operating covenants of the credit facility 

outstanding notes 

on may 12 2016 we issued 500 million of 600 senior notes due 2024 the “2024 6 notes” in a registered offering and used the net proceeds to prepay indebtedness under our senior credit facility as of september 30 2016 unamortized deferred financing fees associated with the offering were 65 million 

the 2024 6 notes are unsecured mature on may 15 2024 and bear interest at a rate of 600 per annum payable semiannually beginning in november 2016 at any time before may 15 2019 i we may redeem up to 40 of the aggregate principal amount of the 2024 6 notes with the net cash proceeds of certain public equity offerings at a price equal to 10600 of the aggregate principal amount redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest provided that at least 60 of the 2024 6 notes that were originally issued remain outstanding immediately thereafter and ii we may redeem some or all of the 2024 6 notes at a price equal to 100 of the aggregate principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest and a makewhole premium on or after may 15 2019 we may redeem some or all of the 2024 6 notes at redemption prices specified in the 2024 6 notes plus accrued and unpaid interest in addition if we undergo a change of control we will be required to make an offer to purchase all the 2024 6 notes at a price equal to 101 of the principal amount of the 2024 6 notes plus accrued and unpaid interest 

the notes were issued under an indenture that contains customary covenants subject to certain exceptions our ability to incur certain additional debt is limited unless after giving pro forma effect to such incurrence and the application of the proceeds thereof the ratio of our ebitda to our consolidated fixed charges as both terms are defined in the indenture is not greater than 200 to 100 the indenture also restricts our ability to incur liens pay dividends or make certain other distributions sell assets or engage in saleleaseback transactions any failure to comply with these and other covenants included in the indenture could constitute an event of default that could result in the acceleration of the payment of the aggregate principal amount of 2024 6 notes then outstanding and accrued interest as of september 30 2016 we were in compliance with all such covenants 

share repurchase authorization 

our articles of organization authorize us to issue up to 500 million  shares of our common stock our board of directors has periodically authorized the repurchase of shares of our common stock in august 2014 our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to 600 million  of our common stock through september 30 2017 we intend to use cash from operations and borrowings under our credit facility to make such repurchases in 2016 we did not repurchase any shares due to the accelerated pace of our transition to a subscription business model and the nearterm impact on free cash flow and ebitda we repurchased 27 million  shares at a cost of 649 million  in 2015 and 51 million  shares at a cost of 2249 million  in 2014 including 125 million  purchased through accelerated share repurchase transaction all shares of our common stock repurchased are automatically restored to the status of authorized and unissued 

expectations for fiscal 2017 

we believe that existing cash and cash equivalents together with cash generated from operations and amounts available under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements which we expect to be 30 million in 2017 through at least the next twelve months and to meet our known longterm capital requirements we expect to resume share repurchases in the second half of fiscal 2017 our ability to repurchase shares is subject to our having sufficient cash available and maintaining compliance with credit facility covenants 

we evaluate possible strategic transactions on an ongoing basis and at any given time may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to possible strategic transactions our expected uses of cash could change our cash position could be reduced and we may incur additional debt obligations to the extent we complete additional acquisitions 

we have substantial cash requirements in the united states and a significant portion of our cash is generated and held outside of the united states at september 30 2016 we had cash and cash equivalents of 273 million  in the united states 1045 million  in europe 1018 million  in the pacific rim including india 243 million  in japan and 200 million  in other nonus countries we believe that the combination of our existing united states cash and cash equivalents future united states operating cash flows and cash available under our credit facility are sufficient to meet our ongoing united states operating expenses and known capital requirements 

contractual obligations 

at september 30 2016 our contractual obligations were as follows 

  



  



as of september 30 2016 we had letters of credit and bank guarantees outstanding of approximately 42 million  of which 12 million  was collateralized primarily related to our corporate headquarters lease in needham massachusetts 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have not created and are not party to any specialpurpose or offbalance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital incurring debt or operating parts of our business that are not consolidated to the extent of our ownership interest therein into our financial statements we have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby we have subordinated retained interests derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks contingent liabilities or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing liquidity market risk or credit risk support to us

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we face exposure to financial market risks including adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 

foreign currency exchange risk 

our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to western european countries japan china and canada we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates that arise from receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies we do not enter into or hold foreign currency derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes nor do we enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge future cash flow or forecast transactions 

our nonus revenues generally are transacted through our nonus subsidiaries and typically are denominated in their local currency in addition expenses that are incurred by our nonus subsidiaries typically are denominated in their local currency in 2016 2015 and 2014 approximately twothirds of our revenue and half of our expenses were transacted in currencies other than the us dollar currency translation affects our reported results because we report our results of operations in us dollars historically our most significant currency risk has been changes in the euro and japanese yen relative to the us dollar based on current revenue and expense levels excluding restructuring charges and stockbased compensation a 010 change in the usd to european exchange rates and a 10 yen change in the yen to usd exchange rate would impact operating income by approximately 8 million and 7 million respectively 

our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations arises in part from intercompany transactions with most intercompany transactions occurring between a us dollar functional currency entity and a foreign currency denominated entity intercompany transactions typically are denominated in the local currency of the nonus dollar functional currency subsidiary in order to centralize foreign currency risk also both ptc the parent company and our nonus subsidiaries may transact business with our customers and vendors in a currency other than their functional currency transaction risk in addition we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results and balances of our nonus subsidiaries are translated into us dollars translation risk if sales to customers outside of the united states increase our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will increase 

our foreign currency risk management strategy is principally designed to mitigate the future potential financial impact of changes in the us dollar value of balances denominated in foreign currency resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates our foreign currency hedging program uses forward contracts to manage the foreign currency exposures that exist as part of our ongoing business operations the contracts primarily are denominated in canadian dollars and european currencies and have maturities of less than three months 

generally we do not designate foreign currency forward contracts as hedges for accounting purposes and changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized immediately in earnings because we enter into forward contracts only as an economic hedge any gain or loss on the underlying foreigndenominated balance would be offset by the loss or gain on the forward contract gains and losses on forward contracts and foreign denominated receivables and payables are included in foreign currency net losses 

as of september 30 2016  and 2015  we had outstanding forward contracts for derivatives not designated as hedging instruments with notional amounts equivalent to the following   

as of september 30 2016  and 2015  we had outstanding forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges with notional amounts equivalent to the following 



debt 

 in addition to amounts due under our 2024 6 notes as described above as of september 30 2016  we had 2581 million  outstanding under our variablerate credit facility loans under the credit facility bear interest at variable rates which reset every 30  to 180  days depending on the rate and period selected by us these loans are subject to interest rate risk as interest rates will be adjusted at each rollover date to the extent such amounts are not repaid as of september 30 2016  the annual rate on the credit facility loans was 256  if there was a hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates the annual net impact to earnings and cash flows would be 26 million this hypothetical change in cash flows and earnings has been calculated based on the borrowings outstanding at september 30 2016 and a 100 basis point per annum change in interest rate applied over a oneyear period 

cash and cash equivalents 

as of september 30 2016  cash equivalents were invested in highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased we invest our cash with highly rated financial institutions in north america europe and asiapacific and in diversified domestic and international money market mutual funds at september 30 2016  we had cash and cash equivalents of 273 million  in the united states 1045 million  in europe 1018 million  in the pacific rim including india 243 million  in japan and 200 million  in other nonus countries given the short maturities and investment grade quality of the portfolio holdings at september 30 2016  a hypothetical 10 change in interest rates would not materially affect the fair value of our cash and cash equivalents 

our invested cash is subject to interest rate fluctuations and for nonus operations foreign currency risk in a declining interest rate environment we would experience a decrease in interest income the opposite holds true in a rising interest rate environment over the past several years the us federal reserve board european central bank and bank of england have changed certain benchmark interest rates which have led to declines and increases in market interest rates these changes in market interest rates have resulted in fluctuations in interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents interest income will continue to fluctuate based on changes in market interest rates and levels of cash available for investment our consolidated cash balances were impacted favorably by 68 million  in 2016 and unfavorably by 179 million  and 94 

million  in 2015 and 2014 respectively due to changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar particularly the euro and the japanese yen

 because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate

the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of september 30 2016  has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which appears under item 8

corporate organizational changes 

as we expand into new technologies our business is becoming more complex and our newer business differs in important ways from our traditional core business the core and new businesses have different strategies and business models and each has its own needs with respect to how to best build market sell and service its products for example we believe that the new iot analytics and augmented reality business is best addressed through a large developer and partner ecosystem cultivated through marketingled approaches whereas we believe our traditional business is best served by leveraging direct sales efforts given the differing gotomarket strategies and the growth opportunities we see in both our core and new businesses we have made changes to our organizational structure that will allow us to more effectively manage these two 

different but complementary business models as of october 1 2015 we reorganized the company into two main business units 

• the  solutions group  comprised of our core cad plm alm and slm and 

• the  technology platform group  comprised of our iot analytics and augmented reality business 

each of the units will be led by a group president and will have separate research and development and gotomarket resources while the other corporate functions will support both we believe that this new structure will allow us to optimize our focus and our balance on each of these two businesses providing focused leadership improved execution and performanceoriented accountability that will enable us to leverage our assets and capabilities with the goal of increasing growth 

our markets 

the markets we serve present different growth opportunities for us we see greater opportunity for market growth in our technology platform solutions followed by slm plm and alm solutions cad which is a more highly penetrated market likely presents a lower growth opportunity over time

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend 

the following are important factors we have identified that could affect our future results you should consider them carefully when evaluating an investment in ptc’s securities or any forwardlooking statements made by us including those contained in this annual report because these factors could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or 

the performance projected in forwardlooking statements the risks described below are not the only risks we face additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business financial condition andor operating results 

i operational considerations 

our operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter making future operating results difficult to predict failure to meet market expectations could cause the price of our securities to decline 

our quarterly operating results historically have fluctuated and are likely to continue to fluctuate depending on a number of factors including 

 accordingly our quarterly results are difficult to predict prior to the end of the quarter and we may be unable to confirm or adjust expectations with respect to our operating results for a particular quarter until that quarter has closed any failure to meet our quarterly revenue or earnings targets could adversely impact the market price of our securities 

we now offer our solutions as subscriptions which will adversely affect our revenue and earnings in the transition period and make predicting our revenue and earnings more difficult 

we began offering most of our solutions under a subscription option in 2015 in addition to our perpetual license option under a subscription customers pay a periodic fee for the right to use our software and receive support or to use our cloud services and have us manage the application for a specified period we believe that a significant number of our customers will elect to purchase our solutions as subscriptions rather than under a perpetual license if available until we have fully transitioned to a stable mix of subscription and perpetual license purchases we expect that our license revenue will decrease due to the difference in revenue recognition for a subscription license revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the license and a perpetual license revenue is generally recognized upon purchase and that our support revenue which comprises a significant portion of our revenue may also decrease due to support services being included in the subscription offering 

our revenue and earnings targets are based on assumptions about the mix of revenue that will be attributable to subscription and perpetual license revenue if a greater percentage of our customers elect to purchase our solutions as subscriptions in a period than we assumed our revenue and earnings will likely fall below our expectations for that period which could cause our stock price to decline 

our long range financial targets are predicated on revenue growth and operating margin improvements that we may fail to achieve which could reduce our expected earnings and cause us to fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors and cause the price of our securities to decline 

we are projecting longterm revenue and earnings growth however as we transition to a subscription model our plan through 2021 assumes that our license revenue and earnings will decrease in 2016 2017 and 2018 due to lower upfront revenue recognized for a subscription license compared to a perpetual license and assumes increases in revenue from a recurring subscription revenue stream beginning in 2019 our projections are based on the expected growth potential in the iot and slm markets with more modest growth expectations for cad and eplm we may not achieve the expected bookings and 

revenue growth if the markets we serve do not grow at expected rates if we are not able to deliver solutions desired by customers and potential customers andor if acquired businesses do not generate the revenue growth that we expect 

our longterm operating margin improvement is predicated on operating leverage as long range revenue increases improved operating efficiencies particularly within our sales organization and service margin improvements services margins are significantly lower than license and support margins future projected improvements in our operating margin as a percent of revenue are based in part on our ability to improve services margins by reducing the amount of direct services that we perform through expansion of our service partner program and improving the profitability of services that we perform if our services revenue increases as a percentage of total revenue andor if we are unable to improve our services margins our overall operating margin may not increase to the levels we expect or may decrease additionally if we do not achieve lower sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue through productivity initiatives we may not achieve our operating margin targets if operating margins do not improve our earnings could be adversely affected and the price of our securities could decline 

our significant investment in our technology platform business may not generate the revenues we expect 

  

we have made a significant investment in recent years in our technology platform business including four acquisitions totaling approximately 450 million our technology platform business provides technology solutions that enable customers to transform their businesses and leverage the opportunities created by the internet of things iot 

  

the technology platform market is a new market for us that requires us to adopt a new sales approach the gotomarket approach for the technology platform business relies on an extensive and differentiated partner ecosystem to enable us to access markets and customers beyond our traditional markets customers and buyers we also expect to focus on marketing directly to software application developers to become the technology platform of choice for the iot we may be unable to expand our partner ecosystem as we expect and developers may not adopt our technology platform solutions as we expect which would adversely affect our ability to realize revenue from our investments in this business 

  

further the internet of things is a relatively new market and there are a significant number of competitors in the market if the market does not expand as rapidly as we or others expect or if customers adopt competitive solutions rather than our solutions our technology platform business may not generate the revenues we expect 

businesses we acquire may not generate the revenue and earnings we anticipate and may otherwise adversely affect our business 

we have acquired and intend to continue to acquire new businesses and technologies if we fail to successfully integrate and manage the businesses and technologies we acquire or if an acquisition does not further our business strategy as we expect our operating results will be adversely affected 

moreover business combinations also involve a number of risks and uncertainties that can adversely affect our operations and operating results including 

 

our restructuring actions and reorganization may be disruptive and could harm our operations 

over the past few years we have taken a number of restructuring actions and reorganizations designed to realign our global workforce to our business needs reduce our expenses and enable us to increase investment in our technology platform business these actions may not have the expected longterm effect on our expenses or may not be sufficient to fully offset additional investments we may make in our business disruptions in operations have occurred and will likely continue to occur as a result of these actions disruptions may include attrition beyond our planned reduction in workforce a negative effect on employee morale or our ability to attract highly skilled employees further we could experience delays business disruptions decreased productivity unanticipated employee turnover and increased litigation related costs in connection with the restructuring and other efficiency initiatives 

we recently committed to a plan to reduce costs and realign investments with what we believe are our high growth opportunities by reducing our workforce and consolidating facilities this restructuring may result in higher charges than anticipated and  or our actual projected expense reductions may fall below our expectations 

we depend on sales within the discrete manufacturing sector and our business could be adversely affected if manufacturing activity does not grow or if it contracts 

a large amount of our revenue is related to sales to customers in the discrete manufacturing sector if this economic sector does not grow or if it contracts our customers in this sector may as they have in the past reduce or defer purchases of our products and services which adversely affects our business in 2015 the manufacturing sector was weak particularly in the americas and china which we believe adversely impacted our sales and operating results in those regions in 2015 we expect global manufacturing economic conditions could continue to adversely impact our results in 2016 particularly in the us and china 

we face significant competition which may reduce our profits and limit or reduce our market share 

the market for product development solutions and iot solutions is rapidly changing and characterized by vigorous competition both by entry of competitors with innovative technologies and by consolidation of companies with complementary products and technologies this competition could result in price reductions for our products and services reduced margins loss of customers and loss of market share our primary competition comes from 

 

in addition barriers to entry into certain segments of the software industry have declined and the ability of customers to adopt software solutions has increased with the ability to offer software in the cloud and the increasing prevalence of subscription license models and customer acceptance of both those models because of these and other factors competitive conditions in the industry are likely to intensify in the future 

increased competition could result in price reductions reduced net revenue and profit margins and loss of market share any of which would likely harm our business 

a breach of security in our products or computer systems or those of our thirdparty service providers could compromise the integrity of our products harm our reputation create additional liability and adversely impact our financial results  

we have implemented and continue to implement measures intended to maintain the security and integrity of our products source code and computer systems the potential consequences of a security breach or system disruption particularly through cyberattack or cyberintrusion including by computer hackers foreign governments and cyber terrorists have increased in scope as the number intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased despite efforts to create security barriers to such threats it is virtually impossible for us to entirely eliminate this risk in addition we offer cloud services to our customers and some of our products are hosted by thirdparty service providers which expose us to additional risks as those repositories of our customers’ proprietary data may be targeted by such hackers a significant breach of the security andor integrity of our products or systems or those of our thirdparty service providers could prevent our products from functioning properly could enable access to sensitive proprietary or confidential information including that of our customers without authorization or could disrupt our business operations or those of our customers this could require us to incur significant costs of remediation harm our reputation cause customers to stop buying our products 

and cause us to face lawsuits and potential liability which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

our sales and operations are globally dispersed which exposes us to additional compliance risks 

we sell and deliver software and services and maintain support operations in a large number of countries whose laws and practices differ from one another and are subject to unexpected changes managing these geographically dispersed operations requires significant attention and resources to ensure compliance with laws of those countries and those of the us governing our activities in nonus countries 

those laws include but are not limited to anticorruption laws and regulations including the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and the uk bribery act 2010 and trade and economic sanctions laws and regulations including laws administered by the us department of the treasury’s office of foreign assets control the us state department the us department of commerce the united nations security council and other relevant sanctions authorities the fcpa and uk bribery act prohibit us and business partners or agents acting on our behalf from offering or providing anything of value to persons considered to be foreign officials under those laws for the purposes of obtaining favorable treatment the uk bribery act also prohibits commercial bribery and accepting bribes our compliance risks with these laws are heightened due to the global nature of our business the fact that we operate in and are expanding into countries with a higher incidence of corruption and fraudulent business practices than others and the fact that we deal with governments and stateowned business enterprises the employees and representatives of which may be considered foreign officials for purposes of the fcpa and the uk bribery act 

accordingly while we strive to maintain a comprehensive compliance program we cannot guarantee that an employee agent or business partner will not act in violation of our policies or us or other applicable laws investigations of alleged violations of those laws can be expensive and disruptive violations of such laws can lead to civil andor criminal prosecutions substantial fines and other sanctions including the revocation of our rights to continue certain operations and also cause business and reputation loss for example as discussed in risk factors ii other considerations we are currently in discussions with the us securities and exchange commission and us department of justice to attempt to resolve an investigation concerning certain payments and expenses by certain business partners and employees in china that raise questions of compliance with laws including the us foreign corrupt practices act andor compliance with our business policies 

our international businesses present economic and operating risks 

we expect that our international operations will continue to expand and to account for a significant portion of our total revenue because we transact business in various foreign currencies the volatility of foreign exchange rates has had and may in the future have a material adverse effect on our revenue expenses and operating results 

other risks inherent in our international operations include but are not limited to the following 

 

we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights 

our software products are proprietary we protect our intellectual property rights in these items by relying on copyrights trademarks patents and common law safeguards including trade secret protection as well as restrictions on disclosures and transferability contained in our agreements with other parties despite these measures the laws of all relevant jurisdictions may not afford adequate protection to our products and other intellectual property in addition we frequently encounter attempts by individuals and companies to pirate our software if our measures to protect our intellectual property rights fail others may be able to use those rights which could reduce our competitiveness and revenues 

in addition any legal action to protect our intellectual property rights that we may bring or be engaged in could be costly may distract management from daytoday operations and may lead to additional claims against us and we may not succeed all of which would materially adversely affect our operating results 

intellectual property infringement claims could be asserted against us which could be expensive to defend and could result in limitations on our use of the claimed intellectual property 

the software industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding copyright patent and other intellectual property rights as well as improper disclosure of confidential or proprietary information if a lawsuit of this type is filed it could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel we cannot be sure that we would prevail against any such asserted claims if we did not prevail we could be prevented from using the claimed intellectual property or be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements which might not be available on terms acceptable to us in addition to possible claims with respect to our proprietary products some of our products contain technology developed by and licensed from third parties and we may likewise be susceptible to infringement claims with respect to these thirdparty technologies 

some of our products contain “open source” software and any failure to comply with the terms of one or more of these open source licenses could negatively affect our business and subject us to possible litigation 

some of our products incorporate socalled “open source” software and we may incorporate open source software into other products in the future such open source software is generally licensed by its authors or other third parties under open source licenses we monitor our use of open source software in an effort to avoid subjecting our products to conditions we do not intend although we believe that we have complied with our obligations under the various applicable licenses for open source software that we use our processes used to monitor how open source software is used could be improperly followed or subject to error 

if an author or other third party that distributes such open source software were to allege that we had not complied with the conditions of one or more of these licenses we could be required to incur significant legal expenses defending against such allegations if our defenses were not successful we could be subject to significant damages we could also be enjoined from the distribution of our products that contained the open source software or be required to modify our products in order to comply with the conditions of the open source licenses in question thereby disrupting the distribution and sale of some of our products in addition if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner under some open source licenses we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software which would adversely affect our ability to derive revenue from the affected products 

our financial condition could be adversely affected if significant errors or defects are found in our software 

sophisticated software can sometimes contain errors defects or other performance problems if errors or defects are discovered in our products we may need to expend significant financial technical and management resources or divert some of our development resources in order to resolve or work around those defects and we may not be able to correct them in a timely manner or provide an adequate response to our customers 

errors defects or other performance problems in our products could also cause us to lose revenue lose customers and lose market share and could subject to liability such defects or problems could also damage our business reputation and cause us to lose new business opportunities 

we may have exposure to additional tax liabilities and our effective tax rate may increase or fluctuate which could increase our income tax expense and reduce our net income 

as a multinational organization we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes in the us and in various foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision and other tax liabilities in the ordinary course of a global business there are many intercompany transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain our tax returns are subject to review by various taxing authorities although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes could be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 

our effective tax rate can be adversely affected by several factors many of which are outside of our control including 

 10 

 

because we have substantial cash requirements in the united states and a significant portion of our cash is generated and held outside of the united states if our cash available in the united states and the cash available under our credit facility is insufficient to meet our operating expenses and debt repayment obligations in the united states we may be required to raise cash in ways that could negatively affect our financial condition results of operations and the market price of our securities 

we have significant operations outside the united states as of september 30 2015 approximately 72 of our cash and cash equivalents balance was held by subsidiaries outside the united states with the remainder of the balance held by the us parent or its subsidiaries in the united states we believe that the combination of our existing united states cash and cash equivalents future united states operating cash flows and cash available under our credit facility are sufficient to meet our ongoing united states operating expenses and known capital requirements however if these sources of cash are insufficient to meet our future financial obligations in the united states we will be required to seek other available funding sources or means to repatriate cash to the united states which could negatively impact our results of operations financial position and the market price of our securities 

ii other considerations 

we have been investigating certain matters in china the resolution of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and our results 

we have been in discussions with the us securities and exchange commission sec and the department of justice doj to resolve an investigation concerning expenditures by our business partners in china and by our china business including for travel and entertainment that apparently benefited employees of customers regarded as state owned enterprises in china this matter involves issues regarding compliance with laws including the us foreign corrupt practices act we have recorded liabilities of 282 million as a result of our agreements in principle with those agencies to settle the matter there can be no assurance that we will enter into final settlements on the agreed terms with these agencies or if not that the cost of any final settlements if reached would not exceed the existing accrual further any settlement or other resolution of this matter could have collateral effects on our business in china the united states and elsewhere 

we are required to comply with certain financial and operating covenants under our credit facility and to make scheduled debt payments as they become due any failure to comply with those covenants or to make scheduled payments could cause amounts borrowed under the facility to become immediately due and payable andor prevent us from borrowing under the facility 

our credit facility consists of a 1 billion revolving loan commitment that matures on september 15 2019 at which time all remaining amounts outstanding will be due and payable in full as of november 4 2015 we had 718 million outstanding under the credit facility we may wish to borrow additional amounts under the facility in the future to support our operations including for strategic acquisitions and share repurchases 

we are required to comply with specified financial and operating covenants and to make payments under the facility which limit our ability to operate our business as we otherwise might operate it our failure to comply with any of these covenants or to meet any payment obligations under the facility could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived would result in any amounts outstanding including any accrued interest and unpaid fees becoming immediately due and payable we might not have sufficient working capital or liquidity to satisfy any repayment obligations in the event of an acceleration of those obligations in addition if we are not in compliance with the financial and operating covenants at the time we wish to borrow funds we will be unable to borrow funds 

we may be unable to meet our goal of returning 40 of free cash flow to shareholders through share repurchases which could decrease your expected return on investment in ptc stock 

in august 2014 we announced a new capital allocation strategy a component of which is a longterm goal of returning approximately 40 of free cash flow cash flow from operations less capital expenditures to shareholders through share repurchases meeting this goal requires ptc to generate consistent free cash flow in the years ahead in an amount sufficient to enable us to continue investing in organic and inorganic growth as well as to return a significant portion of the cash generated to stockholders in the form of share repurchases we may not meet this goal if we do not generate the free cash flow we expect or if we use our available cash to satisfy other priorities in addition our cash flow fluctuates over the course of the year and over multiple years so although our goal is to return 40 of free cash flow to shareholders that is an average over a longer 

term and the number of shares repurchased and amount of free cash flow returned in any given period will vary and may be more or less than 40 in any such period finally the number of shares repurchased for a given amount of cash will vary based on ptc’s stock price so the number of shares repurchased will not be a consistent or predictable number or percentage of outstanding stock 

our stock price has been volatile which may make it harder to resell your shares at a time and at a price that is favorable to you 

market prices for securities of software companies are generally volatile and are subject to significant fluctuations that may be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies the trading prices and valuations of these stocks and of ours may not be predictable negative changes in the public’s perception of the prospects of software companies or of ptc or the markets we serve could depress our stock price regardless of our operating results 

also a large percentage of our common stock is held by institutional investors purchases and sales of our common stock by these institutional investors could have a significant impact on the market price of the stock for more information about those investors please see our proxy statement with respect to our most recent annual meeting of stockholders and schedules 13d and 13g filed with the sec with respect to our common stock

executive overview 

results for 2015 

revenue was down year over year due to changes within our business including a higher mix of subscription revenue in 2015 compared to 2014 as we transition from selling perpetual licenses to a subscriptionbased licensing model as well as external factors including a challenging macroeconomic environment and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our reported revenue due to an increase in the strength of the us dollar relative to international currencies most notably the euro and the yen

 from a geographic perspective we believe macroeconomic challenges in the americas and europe impacted our ability to close large cad and eplm deals which given the maturity of these markets tend to be more cyclical total software revenue was flat in the americas as growth in our iot and slm businesses offset our weaker results in cad and eplm in europe we saw 4 software revenue growth on a constant currency basis driven by iot slm and eplm with a decline in cad pacific rim software revenue declined modestly due to weak results in eplm and slm which we believe was primarily due to the overall economic slowdown in china japan software revenue increased 9 in 2015 on a constant currency basis from 2014 due to ls revenue growth in iot slm and eplm offset by a decline in cad 



gaap and nongaap operating income reflect lower revenue offset by reductions in operating expenses driven by cost savings from restructuring actions and by lower incentive compensation accruals associated with performance based incentive compensation plans for which the associated performance metrics were not achieved additionally our gaap operating margin includes a 66 million pension settlement loss due to the termination of our us pension plan a 28 million accrual associated with the pending china matter and restructuring charges of 43 million due to our april 2015 restructuring plan currency movements reduced gaap eps by approximately 026 both gaap and nongaap eps benefited from a lower tax rate 

our gaap results reflect a tax benefit of 19 million related to the reversal of a portion of the us valuation allowance related to reducing deferred tax assets in connection with settling the us pension plan and a tax benefit of 18 million in 2014 related to the reversal of a portion of the valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets in the us and a foreign jurisdiction as a result of accounting for acquisitions 

we generated 180 million  of cash from operations in 2015 down 41  from 305 million  in 2014 and we borrowed 56 million  under our credit facility to fund acquisitions and stock repurchases the decrease in cash from operations in 2015 compared to 2014 was due in part to pension funding which was higher by 34 million and restructuring payments which were higher by 33 million we used 99 million  of cash to acquire coldlight and 65 million  to repurchase stock at september 30 2015 the balance outstanding under our credit facility was 668 million  and we had 155 million  available to borrow under the revolving loan portion of our credit facility we ended 2015 with 273 million  of cash down from 294 million  at the end 2014 

acquisitions 

i n 2015 we acquired coldlight solutions llc for 99 million  coldlight offers solutions for data machine learning and predictive analytics which expanded our technology portfolio in the iot market coldlight was not material to our results for 2015 

2015 restructuring of our workforce 

in april 2015 we committed to a plan to restructure our global workforce and consolidate select facilities to increase investment in our iot business and to reduce our cost structure through organizational efficiencies in the face of significant foreign currency depreciation relative to the us dollar and a more cautious outlook on global macroeconomic conditions the restructuring actions resulted in charges of 43 million during 2015 including 1 million of facility related charges and 42 million of employee related termination costs primarily related to termination benefits associated with 411 employees this reorganization resulted in net annualized expense reductions of approximately 30 million we recently announced a 2016 restructuring plan as described below in future expectations strategies and risks 

pension termination 

we maintained a us defined benefit pension plan that covered certain persons who were employees of computervision corporation acquired by us in 1998 benefits under the plan were frozen in 1990 in the second quarter of 2014 we began the process of terminating the plan which included settling plan liabilities by offering lump sum distributions to certain plan participants and purchasing annuity contracts to cover vested benefits we completed the termination in the fourth quarter of 2015 in connection with the termination we contributed 255 million  to the plan and recorded a settlement loss of 66 million 

future expectations strategies and risks   

the slowdown in the global manufacturing industry uncertainty about the economic environment volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and our transition to a subscription model were headwinds for revenue and earnings growth in fiscal 2015 while we saw indications of improvements in global manufacturing economic conditions early in 2015 recent economic indicators raise continued concerns about the economic climate and current indicators suggest the global manufacturing economy is weaker than we experienced entering 2015 with foreign currency depreciation and other acute macro factors potentially weighing on our multinational customers particularly in the americas china and japan 

looking forward as we move into 2016 we have three overriding goals 1 to focus on driving sustainable growth 2 to expand our subscriptionbased licensing and 3 to continue to control costs and improve margins 

sustainable growth 

our goals for overall growth are predicated on continuing to expand our iot technology footprint and making structural changes to our business to improve operational performance and increase growth potential for both our new iot solutions as well as our core solutions we continue to invest in iot solutions most recently with our acquisitions of coldlight and vuforia as described in 2015 business developments corporate organizational changes  above  effective in 2016 we have reorganized the company into two main business units the solutions group comprised of our core cad eplm and slm business and the technology platform group comprised of our iot analytics and augmented reality business this new structure will allow for appropriate focus on both the core solutions and the technology platform business 

subscription 

a majority of our software license sales to date have been perpetual licenses where customers own the software license and revenue is recognized at the time of sale due to evolving customer preferences our plan to increase our recurring revenue base as well as acquisitions we have made in the iot and cloud services space we began offering our products under a subscription license model in 2015 a small but growing percentage of our business now consists of ratably recognized subscriptions under a subscription customers do not own the software license but pay a periodic fee for the right to use our software including access to technical support beginning october 1 2015 we launched the second phase of our subscription program with the goal of accelerating our transition to a predominantly subscriptionbased licensing model to drive that acceleration we launched new pricing and packaging for subscriptions and new sales incentive compensation plans to drive our business toward subscription we are targeting that by 2018 a significant majority of our ls bookings could be subscription in 2016 we expect that subscription bookings will increase over 2015 but will still constitute significantly less than a majority of bookings if a greater percentage of our customers elect our subscription offering in 2016 than our base case assumption it will have an adverse impact on revenue operating margin cash flow and eps growth relative to our expectations in addition subscription orders tend to be smaller in size than perpetual deals 

cost controls and margin expansion 

we continue to proactively manage our cost structure and invest in what we believe are high return opportunities in our business our goal is to drive continued margin expansion over the long term to that end on october 23 2015 we committed to a plan to restructure our workforce and consolidate select facilities in order to reduce our cost structure and to realign our investments with our identified growth opportunities the restructuring is expected to result in a charge of approximately 

40 million to 50 million which is primarily attributable to termination benefits substantially all of which will be recorded in our first fiscal quarter ending january 2 2016 the restructuring will result in cash expenditures of approximately 40 million to 50 million which we expect will primarily be paid over the first three quarters of fiscal 2016 we expect that the effect of the expense reductions offset by certain planned cost increases and investments in our business will result in a decrease in costs and expenses of approximately 17 million  in 2016 as compared to 2015 which effect is contemplated in our financial guidance for fiscal 2016 

2016 guidance 

for 2016 we expect yearoveryear revenue to decrease 3 to 5 due to our subscription transition and expected decrease in professional services revenue while subscription revenue is expected to grow by approximately 35 in 2016 the subscription transition is expected to result in a 2 decrease in support revenue and 8 to 15 decrease in perpetual revenue professional services revenue is expected to decrease 12 due to further transition of certain customers to our partners and ongoing development of solutions that require less professional services to deploy our results will differ materially from our guidance if economic conditions do not improve or deteriorate further if foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar differ significantly from our current assumed rates if customers do not purchase subscriptions at the rate we expect if our businesses do not grow as we have assumed or if our cost reductions do not achieve the expected results 

in november 2015 we acquired the vuforia business from qualcomm connected experiences inc for 65 million in cash vuforia is an augmented reality technology platform that expands our technology platform portfolio 

our results have been impacted and we expect will continue to be impacted by our ability to close large transactions the amount of bookings and revenue particularly license and subscriptions attributable to large transactions and the number of such transactions may vary significantly from quarter to quarter based on customer purchasing decisions and macroeconomic conditions such transactions may have long lead times as they often follow a lengthy product selection and evaluation process and for existing customers are influenced by contract expiration cycles this may cause volatility in our results in 2016 we expect large license transactions will continue to be unfavorably impacted by a challenging global manufacturing economy particularly affecting our cad and eplm businesses in addition we expect that deal sizes will decrease as we expect that customers will purchase more of our solutions as subscriptions which may involve smaller purchases than perpetual license purchases 

impact of an investigation in china 

as previously announced we have been in discussions with the us securities and exchange commission sec and the department of justice doj to resolve an investigation concerning expenditures by our business partners in china and by our china business including for travel and entertainment that apparently benefited employees of customers regarded as state owned enterprises in china this matter involves issues regarding compliance with laws including the us foreign corrupt practices act we have recorded liabilities of 282 million as a result of our agreements in principle with those agencies to settle the matter there can be no assurance that we will enter into final settlements on the agreed terms with these agencies or if not that the cost of any final settlements if reached would not exceed the existing accrual further any settlement or other resolution of this matter could have collateral effects on our business in china the united states and elsewhere

results of operations 

acquisitions 

in 2015 we acquired coldlight on may 7 in 2014 we acquired thingworx on december 30 atego on june 30 and axeda on august 11 these acquisitions collectively added 692 million of revenue in 2015 and 98 million of revenue in 2014 

impact of foreign currency exchange on results of operations 

approximately two thirds of our revenue and half of our expenses are transacted in currencies other than the us dollar currency translation affects our reported results which are in us dollars changes in currency exchange rates particularly for the yen and the euro compared to the prior year decreased revenue and decreased expenses in 2015 and increased revenue and decreased expenses in 2014 if actual reported results were converted into us dollars based on the corresponding prior year’s foreign currency exchange rates 2015 and 2014 revenue would have been higher by 997 million and lower by 21 million respectively and expenses would have been higher by 566 million and 09 million respectively the net impact on yearoveryear results would have been an increase in operating income of 431 million in 2015 and a decrease in operating income of 30 million in 2014 the results of operations revenue by line of business and revenue by geographic region in the tables that follow present both actual percentage changes year over year and percentage changes on a constant currency basis 

reclassifications 

through 2014 we classified revenue in three categories 1 license 2 service and 3 support because we introduced subscriptionbased licenses in 2015 we have revised our revenue reporting effective with the beginning of the first quarter of 2015 we report revenue as follows 1 license and subscriptions ls 2 support and 3 professional services ls revenue includes perpetual license revenue subscription revenue and cloud services revenue cloud service offerings were previously reflected in service revenue and cost of service revenue consulting and training service revenue and consulting and training cost of service revenue are now referred to as professional services revenue and cost of professional services revenue the discussion that follows reflects our revised reporting structure 

revenue 

revenue is reported below by line of business license and subscription support and professional services by solution area cad extended plm eplm slm and iot and by geographic region americas europe pacific rim and japan 

results include combined revenue from direct sales and our channel 

revenue by line of business 





ls revenue 

2015 compared to 2014 

the decline in ls revenue in 2015 reflected yearoveryear declines of 12 in the americas 15 in europe down 1 on a constant currency basis and 5 in the pacific rim yearoveryear amounts in japan were flat and increased on a constant currency basis by 16 the decreases were partially related to a higher mix of subscription bookings in 2015 results also reflected lower ls revenue primarily due to fewer large license transactions in 2015 this was particularly true for cad and plm in europe and the americas iot revenue increased significantly primarily as a result of our acquisition of axeda 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates unfavorably impacted ls revenue by 275 million in 2015 compared to 2014 

2014 compared to 2013 

ls revenue was strongest in europe and the americas with 33 and 12 yearoveryear growth respectively offsetting yearoveryear declines in the pacific rim region which was down 17 cad ls revenue was driven by double digit yearoveryear growth in creo modules and upgrades training software and certain heritage products slm ls revenue in 2014 decreased due to a slowerthanexpected rebuilding of our pipeline after a strong 2013 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted ls revenue by 07 million in 2014 compared to 2013 

support revenue 

support revenue is comprised of contracts to maintain new andor previously purchased software support revenue has tended to be fairly stable and predictable yeartoyear however with our transition to subscription sales we expect support revenue will decline as customers purchase our solutions as subscriptions 

support revenue decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 due to the effect of foreign currency exchange rates changes in currency unfavorably impacted support revenue by 518 million in 2015 compared to 2014 

support revenue increased 5 338 million in 2014 compared to 2013 changes in foreign exchange rates did not have a significant effect on support revenue in 2014 

professional services revenue 

consulting and training services engagements typically result from sales of new licenses particularly of our eplm and slm solutions expanding our service partner program under which service engagements are referred to third party service providers is part of our overall margin expansion strategy additionally over time we anticipate implementing solutions that require fewer services as a result we do not expect that the amount of services we deliver will increase proportionately with any ls revenue increases 

2015 compared to 2014 

the decrease in professional services revenue for 2015 was primarily due to a 25 decrease in plmrelated services and changes in foreign currency exchange rates we attribute the decline in total professional services revenue to lower plm and to a lesser extent cad ls revenue and to success in expanding our service partner program 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates unfavorably impacted professional services revenue by 204 million in 2015 compared to 2014 

2014 compared to 2013 

in 2014 professional services revenue declined slightly due to the expansion of our services partner program 

revenue by geographic region 

  



a significant percentage of our annual revenue comes from large customers in the broader manufacturing space as a result ls revenue growth in our core cad and eplm products historically has correlated to growth in broader measures of the global manufacturing economy including gdp industrial production and manufacturing pmi pmi data in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 suggests manufacturing economies in the us china and japan are slowing while manufacturing activity in europe has increased for 2016 our financial guidance assumes a slower rate of growth in the manufacturing economies in the us japan and the pacific rim 

americas 

in 2015 compared to 2014 americas ls revenue decreased 12 due primarily to a decrease in cad and plm ls revenue offset in part by increases in iot ls revenue primarily due to our acquisition of axeda and slm ls revenue professional services revenue decreased by 23 and support revenue increased by 6 

americas revenue increased in 2014 compared to 2013 due to increases in all lines of business primarily a 7 increase in support and a 12 increase in ls revenue 

europe 

in 2015 compared to 2014 changes in foreign currency exchange rates particularly the euro unfavorably impacted revenue by 736 million in 2015 europe ls revenue decreased 15 year over year down 1 on a constant currency basis with constant currency growth in iot and eplm and modest constant currency growth in slm offset by a decline in cad europe support revenue decreased 7 year over year and increased 7 yearoveryear on a constant currency basis 

in 2014 compared to 2013 europe ls revenue increased 33 and support revenue increased 7 europe professional services revenue decreased 3 year over year changes in foreign currency exchange rates particularly the euro favorably impacted revenue in europe by 157 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 

pacific rim 

in 2015 compared to 2014 pacific rim ls revenue declined 5 year over year with growth in iot and modest growth in cad offset by declines in eplm and slm pacific rim support revenue increased 5 year over year and professional services revenue decreased 29 changes in foreign currency exchange rates unfavorably impacted revenue in the pacific rim by 32 million in 2015 compared to 2014 

in 2014 compared to 2013 pacific rim ls revenue declined 17 year over year and professional services revenue decreased 11 pacific rim support revenue increased 7 year over year changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted revenue in the pacific rim by 06 million in 2014 compared to 2013 

in 2015 and 2014 compared to the prior year revenue in china decreased 14 and 12 respectively and represented 4 and 5 respectively of total revenue 

japan 

in 2015 and 2014 declines in japan revenue were due to changes in foreign currency rates in 2015 compared to 2014 japan ls revenue was flat support revenue decreased 10 and professional services revenue increased 15 on a constant currency basis ls revenue increased 16 support revenue increased 5 and professional services revenue increased 34 changes in foreign currency exchange rates unfavorably impacted revenue in japan by 192 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 

in 2014 compared to 2013 japan ls revenue decreased 2 support revenue decreased 8 and professional services revenue decreased 1 on a constant currency basis ls revenue increased 5 professional services revenue increased 9 and support revenue increased 3 changes in foreign currency exchange rates unfavorably impacted revenue in japan by 128 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 

gross margin 



gross margin as a percentage of total revenue in 2015 compared to 2014 reflects lower ls margins due to a higher mix of cloud services revenue due to our acquisition of axeda which has lower margins than license revenue and higher support volume support revenue comprised 54 of our total revenue in 2015 compared to 51 in both 2014 and 2013 

gross margin as a percentage of total revenue in 2014 compared to 2013 reflects higher service margins partially offset by lower ls margins primarily attributable to lower ls revenue and higher amortization of acquired purchased software the increase in our gaap service gross margin in 2014 was due in part to improved consulting margin service margins have improved due to cost reductions and a reduction in the amount of direct services that we perform through expansion of our service partner program 

costs and expenses 

  





  

 2015 compared to 2014 

costs and expenses in 2015 compared to 2014 increased primarily as a result of the following 

 these cost increases were partially offset by

sales and marketing 



our sales and marketing expenses primarily include salaries and benefits sales commissions advertising and marketing programs travel and facility costs 

 our compensation benefit costs and travel expenses were lower by an aggregate of 7 203 million in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to lower headcount

restructuring charges 

  



in april 2015 we committed to a plan to restructure our global workforce and consolidate select facilities to increase investment in our iot business and to reduce our cost structure through organizational efficiencies in the face of significant foreign currency depreciation relative to the us dollar and a more cautious outlook on global macroeconomic conditions the restructuring actions resulted in charges of 434 million during 2015 including 14 million of facility related charges and 420 million of employee related termination costs primarily related to termination benefits associated with 411 employees this reorganization resulted in net annualized expense reductions of approximately 30 million 

in september 2014 in support of integrating businesses acquired in the prior year and the continued evolution of our business model we committed to a plan to restructure our workforce and recorded a restructuring charge of 268 million attributable to termination benefits associated with 283 employees which were primarily paid in fiscal 2015 this restructuring action resulted in annualized cost savings of approximately 30 million in addition in 2014 we recorded restructuring charges of 16 million primarily associated with the completion of the restructuring actions initiated in the fourth quarter of 2013 

in 2013 to improve profitability we implemented restructuring actions and recorded restructuring charges of 522 million including 509 million for severance and related costs associated with approximately 550 employees and 13 million related to facility consolidations these restructuring actions were substantially completed in 2013 and resulted in 16 million per quarter reduction in operating expenses which was reflected in our results for 2014 

in 2015 2014 and 2013 we made cash payments related to restructuring charges of 536 million 206 million and 372 million respectively at september 30 2015 accrued expenses for unpaid restructuring charges totaled 153 million which we expect to pay within the next twelve months 

nonoperating income expense 



foreign currency net losses foreign currency net losses include costs of hedging contracts certain realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains or losses and foreign exchange gains or losses resulting from the required periodend currency remeasurement of the assets and liabilities of our subsidiaries that use the us dollar as their functional currency because a large portion of our revenue and expenses is transacted in foreign currencies we engage in hedging transactions involving the use of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 

interest income interest income represents earnings on the investment of our available cash balances and interest on financing provided to customers as described in note b summary of significant accounting policies  of notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report 

interest expense interest expense is primarily related to interest on borrowings under our credit facility the increase in interest expense in 2015 from 2014 and 2013 is due to higher average amounts outstanding under our credit facility we had 668 million  outstanding under the credit facility at september 30 2015 compared to 612 million at september 30 2014 including 295 million borrowed in the fourth quarter of 2014 to fund our acquisition of axeda and to fund an accelerated share repurchase program and 258 million at september 30 2013 the balance outstanding at september 30 2015 reflects amounts borrowed in 2015 as a result of our acquisition of coldlight the average interest rate on amounts outstanding under the credit facility was 17  in 2015 16 in 2014 and 17 in 2013 

other income expense net the change in other income expense net in 2013 compared to 2014 and 2015 was due primarily to a legal settlement gain of 51 million recorded in 2013 

income taxes 



in 2015 our effective tax rate was lower than the 35  statutory federal income tax rate due in large part to our corporate structure in which our foreign taxes are at an effective tax rate lower than the us a significant amount of our foreign earnings is generated by our subsidiaries organized in ireland in 2015 2014 and 2013 the foreign rate differential predominantly relates to these irish earnings our foreign rate differential in 2015 includes a rate benefit from a business realignment completed on september 30 2014 in which intellectual property was transferred between two whollyowned foreign subsidiaries the realignment allows us to more efficiently manage the distribution of our products to european customers in 2015 this realignment resulted in a tax benefit of approximately 240 million  we expect this realignment to result in an annual tax benefit of approximately 15 million to 20 million for the next several years declining annually thereafter through 2021 us permanent items include the tax effect of a 145 million expense related to a pending legal settlement  other factors impacting the effective tax rate include the release of a valuation allowance totaling 187 million  relating to the us pension plan termination foreign withholding taxes of 38 million  a tax benefit of 31 million  relating to the reassessment of our reserve requirements and a benefit of 14 million  in conjunction with the reorganization of our atego us subsidiaries additionally our provision reflects a 21 million  tax benefit related to a retroactive extension of the us research and development tax credit enacted in the first quarter of 2015 this benefit was offset by a corresponding provision to increase our us valuation allowance 

in 2014 our effective tax rate was lower than the 35  statutory federal income tax rate due to our corporate structure in which our foreign taxes are at a net effective tax rate lower than the us rate and the reversal of a portion of our valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets described below other factors impacting the rate include foreign withholding taxes of 51 million  and the establishment of a valuation allowance totaling 35 million  in two foreign subsidiaries 

in 2013 our effective tax rate was lower than the 35  statutory federal income tax rate due in large part to the reversal of a portion of the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets primarily the us we recorded benefits resulting from 2013 acquisitions as described below and a benefit of 79 million  related to the release of a valuation allowance as a result of a pension gain recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in equity additionally our 2013 tax provision reflected a 20 million  provision related to a research and development rd cost sharing prepayment by a foreign subsidiary to the us a similar prepayment was made in 2012 resulting in a 78 million  provision in that year this impact was offset by a corresponding increase in our valuation allowance in the us other factors impacting the rate include our corporate structure in which our foreign taxes are at an effective tax rate lower than the us rate foreign withholding taxes of 60 million  and noncash tax benefits of 53 million  recorded as a result of the conclusion of tax audits in several foreign jurisdictions 

acquisitions in 2014 and 2013 were accounted for as business combinations assets acquired including the fair value of acquired tangible assets intangible assets and assumed liabilities were recorded and we recorded net deferred tax liabilities of 216 million  and 387 million  in 2014 and 2013 respectively primarily related to the tax effect of the acquired intangible assets that are not deductible for income tax purposes these deferred tax liabilities reduced our net deferred tax asset balance and resulted in a tax benefit of 181 million  and 367 million  in 2014 and 2013 respectively to decrease our valuation allowance in jurisdictions where we have recorded a valuation allowance as these decreases in the valuation allowance are not part of the accounting for business combinations the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed they were recorded as an income tax benefit 

we have concluded based on the weight of available evidence that a full valuation allowance continues to be required against our us net deferred tax assets as they are not more likely than not to be realized in the future we will continue to reassess whether a valuation allowance is required each financial reporting period 

in the normal course of business ptc and its subsidiaries are examined by various taxing authorities including the internal revenue service irs in the united states we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate we are currently under audit by tax authorities in several jurisdictions audits by tax authorities typically involve examination of the deductibility of certain permanent items limitations on net operating losses and tax credits although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in material changes in our estimates 

our future effective income tax rate may be materially impacted by the amount of income taxes associated with our foreign earnings which are taxed at rates different from the us federal statutory income tax rate as well as the timing and extent of the realization of deferred tax assets and changes in the tax law further our tax rate may fluctuate within a fiscal year including from quarter to quarter due to items arising from discrete events including settlements of tax audits and assessments the resolution or identification of tax position uncertainties and acquisitions of other companies 

nongaap measures 

the nongaap measures presented in the above discussion of our results of operations and the respective most directly comparable gaap measures are 

 the nongaap measures exclude fair value adjustments related to acquired deferred revenue acquired deferred costs stockbased compensation expense amortization of acquired intangible assets expense acquisitionrelated charges restructuring charges pension plan terminationrelated costs identified discrete items included in nonoperating other income expense net and the related tax effects of the preceding items and any other identified tax items these items are normally included in the comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 

fair value of acquired deferred revenue  is a purchase accounting adjustment recorded to reduce acquired deferred revenue to the fair value of the remaining obligation 

stockbased compensation expense  is noncash expense relating to stockbased awards issued to executive officers employees and outside directors consisting of restricted stock stock options and restricted stock units 

amortization of acquired intangible assets expense  is a noncash expense that is impacted by the timing and magnitude of our acquisitions we believe the assessment of our operations excluding these costs is relevant to our assessment of internal operations and comparisons to the performance of other companies in our industry 

acquisitionrelated charges included in general and administrative expenses include direct costs of potential and completed acquisitions and expenses related to acquisition integration activities including transaction fees due diligence costs severance and professional fees in addition subsequent adjustments to our initial estimated amount of contingent consideration associated with specific acquisitions are included within acquisitionrelated charges these costs are not considered part of our normal operations as the occurrence and amount will vary depending on the timing and size of acquisitions 

us pension plan terminationrelated costs include charges related to our plan that we began terminating in the second quarter of 2014 costs associated with the termination are not considered part of our ongoing operations 

pending legal settlement accrual includes amounts related to the china matter described in impact of an investigation in china 

restructuring charges  include excess facility restructuring charges and severance costs resulting from reductions of personnel driven by modifications to our business strategy and not as part of our normal operations these costs may vary in size based on our restructuring plan 

we use these nongaap measures and we believe that they assist our investors to make periodtoperiod comparisons of our operational performance because they provide a view of our operating results without items that are not in our view indicative of our core operating results we believe that these nongaap measures help illustrate underlying trends in our business and we use the measures to establish budgets and operational goals communicated internally and externally for managing our business and evaluating our performance we believe that providing nongaap measures affords investors a view of our operating results that may be more easily compared to the results of peer companies in addition compensation of our executives is based in part on the performance of our business based on these nongaap measures 

the items excluded from the nongaap measures often have a material impact on our financial results and such items often recur accordingly the nongaap measures included in this annual report should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for or superior to the comparable measures prepared in accordance with gaap 

the following tables reconcile each of these nongaap measures to its most closely comparable gaap measure on our financial statements 

  





  

 critical accounting policies and estimates 

we have prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america in preparing our financial statements we make estimates assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our reported revenues results of operations and net income as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet these estimates assumptions and judgments are necessary because future events and their effects on our results and the value of our assets cannot be determined with certainty and are made based on our historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances these estimates may change as new events occur or additional information is obtained and we may periodically be faced with uncertainties the outcomes of which are not within our control and may not be known for a prolonged period of time 

the accounting policies methods and estimates used to prepare our financial statements are described generally in note b summary of significant accounting policies  of “notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report the most important accounting judgments and estimates that we made in preparing the financial statements involved 

 30 

 a critical accounting policy is one that is both material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires us to make subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies require us to make assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time of the estimate and different estimates that we could have used or changes in the estimates that are reasonably likely to occur may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process actual results could differ from those estimates 

accounting policies guidelines and interpretations related to our critical accounting policies and estimates are generally subject to numerous sources of authoritative guidance and are often reexamined by accounting standards rule makers and regulators these rule makers andor regulators may promulgate interpretations guidance or regulations that may result in changes to our accounting policies which could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 

revenue recognition 

our sources of revenue include 1 license and subscription 2 support and 3 professional services we record revenues in accordance with the guidance provided by asc 985605 softwarerevenue recognition when the following criteria are met 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 2 delivery has occurred generally fob shipping point or electronic distribution 3 the fee is fixed or determinable and 4 collection is probable we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with determining the amounts of software license and services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period our primary judgments involve the following 

 our software is distributed primarily through our direct sales force in addition we have an indirect distribution channel through alliances with resellers revenue arrangements with resellers are recognized on a sellthrough basis that is when we deliver the product to the enduser customer we record consideration given to a reseller as a reduction of revenue to the extent we have recorded revenue from the reseller we do not offer contractual rights of return stock balancing or price protection to our resellers and actual product returns from them have been insignificant to date as a result we do not maintain reserves for reseller product returns 

at the time of each sale transaction we must make an assessment of the collectability of the amount due from the customer revenue is only recognized at that time if management deems that collection is probable in making this assessment we consider customer creditworthiness and historical payment experience at that same time we assess whether fees are fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties in assessing whether the fee is fixed or determinable we consider the payment terms of the transaction including transactions with payment terms that extend beyond our customary payment terms and our collection experience in similar transactions without making concessions among other factors we have periodically provided financing to creditworthy customers with payment terms up to 24 months if the fee is determined not to be fixed or determinable revenue is recognized only as payments become due from the customer provided that all other revenue recognition criteria are met our software license arrangements generally do not include customer acceptance provisions however if an arrangement includes an acceptance provision we record revenue only upon the earlier of 1 receipt of written acceptance from the customer or 2 expiration of the acceptance period 

generally our contracts are accounted for individually however when contracts are closely interrelated and dependent on each other it may be necessary to account for two or more contracts as one to reflect the substance of the group of contracts 

license and subscription 

license and subscription ls revenue includes revenue from three primary sources 1 sales of perpetual licenses 2 subscriptionbased licenses and 3 cloud services 

under perpetual license arrangements we generally recognize license revenue up front upon shipment to the customer we use the residual method to recognize revenue from perpetual license software arrangements that include one or more elements to be delivered at a future date when evidence of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists and the elements of the arrangement qualify for separate accounting as described below under the residual method the fair value of the 

undelivered elements ie support and services based on our vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” of fair value is deferred and the remaining portion of the total arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements ie perpetual software license if evidence of the fair value of one or more of the undelivered elements does not exist all revenues are deferred and recognized when delivery of all of those elements has occurred or when fair values can be established we determine vsoe of the fair value of services and support revenue based upon our recent pricing for those elements when sold separately for certain transactions vsoe is determined based on a substantive renewal clause within a customer contract our current pricing practices are influenced primarily by product type purchase volume sales channel and customer location we review services and support sold separately on a periodic basis and update when appropriate our vsoe of fair value for such elements to ensure that it reflects our recent pricing experience 

subscriptionbased licenses include the right for a customer to use our licenses and receive related support for a specified term and revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement when sold in arrangements with other elements vsoe of fair value is established for the subscriptionbased licenses through the use of a substantive renewal clause within the customer contract for a combined annual fee that includes the termbased license and related support 

cloud services reflect recurring revenues that include fees for hosting and application management of customers’ perpetual or subscriptionbased licenses generally customers have the right to terminate the cloud services contract and take possession of the licenses without a significant penalty when cloud services are sold as part of a multielement transaction revenue is allocated to cloud services based on vsoe and recognized ratably over the contractual term beginning on the commencement dates of each contract which is the date the services are made available to the customer vsoe is established for cloud services either through a substantive stated renewal option or stated contractual overage rates as these rates represent the value the customer is willing to pay on a standalone basis in addition cloud services include setup fees which are recognized ratably over the contract term or the expected customer life whichever is longer 

support 

support contracts generally include rights to unspecified upgrades when and if available telephone and internetbased support updates and bug fixes support revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the support contract on a straightline basis 

professional services 

our software arrangements often include implementation consulting and training services that are sold under consulting engagement contracts or as part of the software license arrangement when we determine that such services are not essential to the functionality of the licensed software we record revenue separately for the license and service elements of these arrangements provided that appropriate evidence of fair value exists for the undelivered services ie vsoe of fair value we consider various factors in assessing whether a service is not essential to the functionality of the software including if the services may be provided by independent third parties experienced in providing such services ie consulting and implementation in coordination with dedicated customer personnel and whether the services result in significant modification or customization of the software’s functionality when professional services qualify for separate accounting professional services revenues under time and materials billing arrangements are recognized as the services are performed professional services revenues under fixedpriced contracts are generally recognized as the services are performed using a proportionate performance model with hours or costs as the input method of attribution 

when we provide professional services that are considered essential to the functionality of the software the arrangement does not qualify for separate accounting of the license and service elements and the license revenue is recognized together with the consulting services using the percentageofcompletion method of contract accounting under such arrangements consideration is recognized as the services are performed as measured by an observable input in these circumstances we separate license revenue from service revenue for income statement presentation by allocating vsoe of fair value of the consulting services as service revenue and the residual portion as license revenue under the percentageofcompletion method we estimate the stage of completion of contracts with fixed or “not to exceed” fees based on hours or costs incurred to date as compared with estimated total project hours or costs at completion adjustments to estimates to complete are made in the periods in which facts resulting in a change become known when total cost estimates exceed revenues we accrue for the estimated losses when identified the use of the proportionate performance and percentageofcompletion methods of accounting require significant judgment relative to estimating total contract costs or hours hours being a proxy for costs including assumptions relative to the length of time to complete the project the nature and complexity of the work to be performed and anticipated changes in salaries and other costs 

reimbursements of outofpocket expenditures incurred in connection with providing consulting services are included in service revenue with the offsetting expense recorded in cost of service revenue 

training services include onsite and classroom training training revenues are recognized as the related training services are provided 

accounting for income taxes 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to calculate our income tax expense based on taxable income by jurisdiction there are many transactions and calculations about which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain as a result our calculations involve estimates by management some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenuesharing costreimbursement and transfer pricing arrangements among related entities and the differing tax treatment of revenue and cost items across various jurisdictions if we were compelled to revise or to account differently for our arrangements that revision could affect our tax liability 

the income tax accounting process also involves estimating our actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheets we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized we must establish a valuation allowance as a charge to income tax expense 

as of september 30 2015 we have a valuation allowance of 1665 million  against net deferred tax assets in the us and a valuation allowance of 317 million  against net deferred tax assets in certain foreign jurisdictions we have concluded based on the weight of available evidence that a full valuation allowance continues to be required against our us net deferred tax assets as they are not more likely than not to be realized in the future we will continue to reassess our valuation allowance requirements each financial reporting period 

the valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets of certain foreign jurisdictions is established primarily for our net operating loss carryforwards the majority of which do not expire there are limitations imposed on the utilization of such net operating losses that could further restrict the recognition of any tax benefits 

we have not provided for us income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on foreign unrepatriated earnings as it is our current intention to permanently reinvest these earnings outside the us unless it can be done with no significant tax cost with the exception of a newly formed foreign holding company there was no impact to this assertion in the current year in the future we expect to incur annual deferred tax expense of 11 million  if we decide to change this assertion in the future to repatriate any additional nonus earnings we may be required to establish a deferred tax liability on such earnings the cumulative amount of undistributed earnings of our subsidiaries for which us income taxes have not been provided totaled approximately 1915 million  and 613 million  as of september 30 2015 and 2014 respectively in 2015 we reorganized certain european entities to simplify our legal and reporting structure this reorganization resulted in a transfer of assets between subsidiaries and triggered a gain that resulted in an increase in unremitted earnings the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability on the undistributed earnings cannot be practicably determined at this time 

in the normal course of business ptc and its subsidiaries are examined by various taxing authorities including the internal revenue service irs in the united states we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate we are currently under audit by tax authorities in several jurisdictions audits by tax authorities typically involve examination of the deductibility of certain permanent items limitations on net operating losses and tax credits although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in material changes in our estimates 

valuation of assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations 

in accordance with business combination accounting we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values determining these fair values requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets 

our identifiable intangible assets acquired consist of developed technology core technology tradenames customer lists and contracts and software support agreements and related relationships developed technology consists of products that have reached technological feasibility core technology represents a combination of processes inventions and trade secrets related to the design and development of acquired products customer lists and contracts and software support agreements and related relationships represent the underlying relationships and agreements with customers of the acquired company’s installed base we have generally valued intangible assets using a discounted cash flow model critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to 

 33 

 in addition we estimate the useful lives of our intangible assets based upon the expected period over which we anticipate generating economic benefits from the related intangible asset 

net tangible assets consist of the fair values of tangible assets less the fair values of assumed liabilities and obligations except for deferred revenues net tangible assets were generally valued by us at the respective carrying amounts recorded by the acquired company if we believed that their carrying values approximated their fair values at the acquisition date the values assigned to deferred revenue reflect an amount equivalent to the estimated cost plus an appropriate profit margin to perform the services related to the acquired company’s software support contracts 

in addition uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date and we reevaluate these items quarterly with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill provided that we are within the measurement period up to one year from the acquisition date and we continue to collect information in order to determine their estimated values subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the estimated value of uncertain tax positions or tax related valuation allowances whichever comes first changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of operations 

our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable at that time but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions estimates or actual results 

when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a finitelived intangible asset may not be recoverable we perform an assessment of the asset for potential impairment this assessment is based on projected undiscounted future cash flows over the asset’s remaining life if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its undiscounted cash flows we record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset determined using projected discounted future cash flows of the asset 

valuation of goodwill 

our goodwill totaled 10690 million and 10125 million  as of september 30 2015 and 2014 respectively we have two operating segments 1 software products and 2 services we assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level our reporting units are determined based on the components of our operating segments that constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and for which operating results are regularly reviewed by segment management our reporting units are consistent with our operating segments as of september 30 2015 and 2014 goodwill and acquired intangible assets in the aggregate attributable to our software products reportable segment was 12979 million  and 12830 million  respectively and attributable to our services reportable segment was 624 million  and 664 million  respectively we test goodwill for impairment in the third quarter of our fiscal year or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting segment below its carrying value factors we consider important on an overall company basis and reportable segment basis as applicable that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results significant changes in our use of the acquired assets or a significant change in the strategy for our business significant negative industry or economic trends a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period or a reduction of our market capitalization relative to net book value 

 we completed our annual goodwill impairment review as of july 4 2015  and concluded that no impairment charge was required as of that date to conduct our test of goodwill the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value if the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value we record an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value of goodwill and its implied fair value we estimate the fair values of our reporting units using discounted cash flow valuation models those models require estimates of future revenues profits capital expenditures working capital terminal values based on revenue multiples and discount rates for each reporting unit we estimate these amounts by evaluating historical trends current budgets operating plans and industry data the estimated fair value of each reporting unit was more than double its carrying value as of july 4 2015  

accounting for pensions 

we sponsor several international pension plans we make assumptions that are used in calculating the expense and liability of these plans these key assumptions include the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate 

used to determine the present value of benefit obligations in selecting the expected longterm rate of return on assets we consider the average future rate of earnings expected on the funds invested to provide for the benefits under the pension plan this includes considering the plans asset allocations and the expected returns likely to be earned over the life of the plans the discount rate reflects the estimated rate at which an amount that is invested in a portfolio of highquality debt instruments would provide the future cash flows necessary to pay benefits when they come due the actuarial assumptions used by us may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions or longer or shorter life spans of the participants our actual results could differ materially from those we estimated which could require us to record a greater amount of pension expense in future years andor require higher than expected cash contributions 

we previously maintained a us defined benefit pension plan the plan that covered certain persons who were employees of computervision corporation acquired by us in 1998 benefits under the plan were frozen in 1990 in the second quarter of 2014 we began the process of terminating the plan and we completed the plan termination in the fourth quarter of 2015 as of september 30 2014 we valued the projected benefit obligations of the us plan based on the present value of estimated costs to settle the liabilities through a combination of lump sum payments to participants and purchasing annuities from an insurance company this reflected an estimate of how many participants we expected will accept a lump sum offering and an estimate of lump sum payouts for those participants liabilities expected to be settled through annuity contracts were estimated based on future benefit payments discounted based on current interest rates that correspond to the liability payouts adjusted to reflect a premium that would be assessed by the insurer 

we settled the liabilities in 2015 and recognized a settlement loss of 663 million  based on the projected benefit obligations and assets measured as of the dates the settlements occurred in the fourth quarter of 2015 we contributed 25 million  to fully fund the plan 

in determining our us pension cost for 2015 2014 and 2013 we used a discount rate of 380  490  and 400  respectively and an expected return on plan assets of 135  for 2015 725  for 2014 and 2013 the decrease in the expected return in 2015 was because assets were moved to fixed income security in anticipation of terminating the us pension plan 

certain of our international subsidiaries principally germany also sponsor pension plans accounting and reporting for these plans requires the use of countryspecific assumptions for discount rates and expected rates of return on assets we apply a consistent methodology in determining the key assumptions that in addition to future experience assumptions such as mortality rates are used by our actuaries to determine our liability and expense for each of these plans the discount rate for germany was selected with reference to a spotrate yield curve based on the yields of aarated eurodenominated corporate bonds in addition our actuarial consultants determine the expense and liabilities of the plan using other assumptions for future experience such as mortality rates in determining our pension cost for 2015 2014 and 2013 we used weighted average discount rates of 24  33  and 34  respectively and weighted average expected returns on plan assets of 58  57  and 54  respectively in 2015  2014 and 2013 our actual return on plan assets for all plans was 19 million  159 million  and 136 million respectively if actual returns are below our expected rates of return it will impact the amount and timing of future contributions and expense for these plans 

as of september 30 2015 and 2014 our plans in total were underfunded representing the difference between our projected benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets by 202 million  and 612 million  respectively the projected benefit obligation as of september 30 2015 was determined using a weighted average discount rate of 22  for our international plans the most sensitive assumptions used in calculating the expense and liability of our pension plans are the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets total gaap net periodic pension cost was 739 million  in 2015 including a 663 million  settlement loss related to the us plan termination and we expect it to be approximately 2 million  in 2016 a 50 basis point change to our discount rate and expected return on plan assets assumptions would have changed our pension expense for the year ended september 30 2015 by approximately 1 million a 50 basis point decrease in our discount rate assumptions would increase our projected benefit obligation as of september 30 2015 by approximately 7 million 

legal contingencies 

we are periodically subject to various legal claims and involved in various legal proceedings we routinely review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any matter is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we record a liability for the estimated loss significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether the amount of an exposure is reasonably estimable because of inherent uncertainties related to these legal matters we base our loss accruals on the best information available at the time further estimates of this nature are highly subjective and the final outcome of these matters could vary significantly from the amounts that have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as additional information becomes available we reassess our potential liability and may revise our estimates such revisions could have a material impact on future quarterly or annual results of operations 

liquidity and capital resources 

  



we invest our cash with highly rated financial institutions and in diversified domestic and international money market mutual funds the portfolio is invested in shortterm instruments to ensure cash is available to meet requirements as needed at september 30 2015  cash and cash equivalents totaled 2734 million  down from 2937 million  at september 30 2014 reflecting 1799 million  in operating cash flow 563 million  of net amounts borrowed under our credit facility 100 million borrowed in the third quarter of 2015 as a result of our acquisition of coldlight net of amounts repaid in 2015 partially offset by 99 million used to acquire coldlight and 649 million  used to repurchase common shares outstanding 

cash provided by operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities was 1799 million  in 2015 compared to 3046 million  in 2014 and 2247 million  in 2013 cash provided by operations was lower due to lower net income higher restructuring payments  536 million  in 2015 compared to 206 million  in 2014 and 372 million  in 2013 and contributions to pension plans which were higher by 338 million in 2015 cash paid for income taxes was 301 million  255 million  and 354 million  in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively 

accounts receivable days sales outstanding was 57 days as of september 30 2015 compared to 58 days as of september 30 2014 and 60 days as of september 30 2013 we periodically provide financing with payment terms up to 24 months to creditworthy customers other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets include noncurrent receivables from customers related to extended payment term contracts totaling 56 million  and 135 million  at september 30 2015 and 2014 respectively we periodically transfer future payments under customer contracts to thirdparty financial institutions on a nonrecourse basis we sold 30 million  of receivables in 2015  compared to 245 million  in 2014  and 170 million  in 2013

share repurchase authorization 

our articles of organization authorize us to issue up to 500 million  shares of our common stock our board of directors has periodically authorized the repurchase of shares of our common stock we were authorized to repurchase up to 100 million  worth of shares with cash from operations for each of our fiscal years 2014 and 2013 additionally on august 4 2014 our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to an additional 600 million  of our common stock through september 30 2017 we intend to use cash from operations and borrowings under our credit facility to make such repurchases pursuant to this repurchase authorization in the fourth quarter of 2014 we entered into the 125 million  accelerated share repurchase agreement described below we repurchased 27 million  shares at a cost of 649 million  in 2015 51 million  shares at a cost of 2249 million  in 2014 including 125 million  purchased through accelerated share repurchase agreement described below and 31 million  shares at a cost of 749 million  in 2013 all shares of our common stock repurchased are automatically restored to the status of authorized and unissued

the credit facility limits ptc’s and its subsidiaries’ ability to among other things incur liens or guarantee obligations pay dividends other than to ptc and make other distributions make investments and enter into joint ventures dispose of assets and engage in transactions with affiliates except on an armslength basis under the credit facility ptc and its material domestic subsidiaries may not invest cash or property in or loan to ptc’s foreign subsidiaries in aggregate amounts exceeding 75 million  for any purpose and an additional 200 million for acquisitions of businesses in addition under the credit facility ptc and its subsidiaries must maintain the following financial ratios 

 any failure to comply with the financial or operating covenants of the credit facility would prevent ptc from being able to borrow additional funds and would constitute a default permitting the lenders to among other things accelerate the amounts outstanding including all accrued interest and unpaid fees under the credit facility and to terminate the credit facility a change in control of ptc as defined in the agreement also constitutes an event of default permitting the lenders to accelerate the indebtedness and terminate the credit facility 

expectations for fiscal 2016 

we believe that existing cash and cash equivalents together with cash generated from operations and amounts available under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements which we expect to be 37 million in 2016 through at least the next twelve months and to meet our known longterm capital requirements in 2016 we expect to pay 28 million to settle the china matter and to repurchase 80 million of our stock our ability to repurchase shares is subject to our having sufficient cash available and maintaining compliance with credit facility covenants 

we evaluate possible strategic transactions on an ongoing basis and at any given time may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to possible strategic transactions our expected uses of cash could change our cash position could be reduced and we may incur additional debt obligations to the extent we complete additional acquisitions 

we have substantial cash requirements in the united states and a significant portion of our cash is generated and held outside of the united states at september 30 2015 we had cash and cash equivalents of 755 million in the united states 667 million in europe 892 million in the pacific rim including india 208 million in japan and 211 million in other nonus countries we believe that the combination of our existing united states cash and cash equivalents future united states operating cash flows and cash available under our credit facility are sufficient to meet our ongoing united states operating expenses and known capital requirements 

in november of 2015 we acquired the vuforia business from qualcomm connected experiences inc for 65 million in cash 

contractual obligations 

at september 30 2015 our contractual obligations were as follows 

  



  

 as of september 30 2015 we had letters of credit and bank guarantees outstanding of approximately 4 million  of which 11 million  was collateralized primarily related to our corporate headquarters lease in needham massachusetts 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have not created and are not party to any specialpurpose or offbalance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital incurring debt or operating parts of our business that are not consolidated to the extent of our ownership interest therein into our financial statements we have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby we have subordinated retained interests derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks contingent liabilities or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing liquidity market risk or credit risk support to us 

recent accounting pronouncements 

revenue recognition 

in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 asu 201409 to supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under us gaap the core principle of asu 201409 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services asu 201409 defines a five step process to achieve this core principle and in doing so it is possible more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than required under existing us gaap 

including identifying performance obligations in the contract estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation asu 201409 is effective for us in our first quarter of fiscal 2018 using either of two methods i retrospective to each prior reporting period presented with the option to elect certain practical expedients as defined within asu 201409 or ii retrospective with the cumulative effect of initially applying asu 201409 recognized at the date of initial application and providing certain additional disclosures as defined per asu 201409 we are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of asu 201409 on our consolidated financial statements 

debt issuance costs 

in april 2015 the fasb issued asu no 201503 interestimputation of interest subtopic 83530 to simplify the required presentation of debt issuance costs the amended guidance requires that debt issuance costs be presented in the balance sheet as a direct reduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability rather than as an asset it is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2015 our fiscal 2017 with early adoption permitted the new guidance will be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented we are currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on our consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we face exposure to financial market risks including adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 

foreign currency exchange risk 

our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to western european countries japan china and canada we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates that arise from receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies we do not enter into or hold foreign currency derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes nor do we enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge future cash flow or forecast transactions 

our nonus revenues generally are transacted through our nonus subsidiaries and typically are denominated in their local currency in addition expenses that are incurred by our nonus subsidiaries typically are denominated in their local currency in 2015 2014 and 2013 approximately twothirds of our revenue and half of our expenses were transacted in currencies other than the us dollar currency translation affects our reported results because we report our results of operations in us dollars historically our most significant currency risk has been changes in the euro and japanese yen relative to the us dollar based on 2015 revenue and expense levels excluding restructuring charges and stockbased compensation a 010 change in the usd to european exchange rates and a 10 yen change in the yen to usd exchange rate would impact operating income by approximately 19 million and 6 million respectively 

our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations arises in part from intercompany transactions with most intercompany transactions occurring between a us dollar functional currency entity and a foreign currency denominated entity intercompany transactions typically are denominated in the local currency of the nonus dollar functional currency subsidiary in order to centralize foreign currency risk also both ptc the parent company and our nonus subsidiaries may transact business with our customers and vendors in a currency other than their functional currency transaction risk in addition we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results and balances of our nonus subsidiaries are translated into us dollars translation risk if sales to customers outside of the united states increase our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will increase 

our foreign currency risk management strategy is principally designed to mitigate the future potential financial impact of changes in the us dollar value of balances denominated in foreign currency resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates our foreign currency hedging program uses forward contracts to manage the foreign currency exposures that exist as part of our ongoing business operations the contracts primarily are denominated in canadian dollars and european currencies and have maturities of less than three months 

generally we do not designate foreign currency forward contracts as hedges for accounting purposes and changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized immediately in earnings because we enter into forward contracts only as an economic hedge any gain or loss on the underlying foreigndenominated balance would be offset by the loss or gain on the forward contract gains and losses on forward contracts and foreign denominated receivables and payables are included in foreign currency net losses 

as of september 30 2015  and 2014  we had outstanding forward contracts with notional amounts equivalent to the following 

  



debt 

 as of september 30 2015  we had 6681 million  outstanding under our variablerate credit facility comprised of a 475 million  term loan and a 1931 million  revolving loan loans under the credit facility bear interest at variable rates which reset every 30  to 180  days depending on the rate and period selected by the company these loans are subject to interest rate risk as interest rates will be adjusted at each rollover date to the extent such amounts are not repaid as of september 30 2015  the annual rates on the term and revolving loan loans were 1875  if there was a hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates the annual net impact to earnings and cash flows would be 67 million this hypothetical change in cash flows and earnings has been calculated based on the borrowings outstanding at september 30 2015 and a 100 basis point per annum change in interest rate applied over a oneyear period 

cash and cash equivalents 

as of september 30 2015  cash equivalents were invested in highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased we invest our cash with highly rated financial institutions in north america europe and asiapacific and in diversified domestic and international money market mutual funds at september 30 2015  we had cash and cash equivalents of 755 million in the united states 667 million in europe 892 million in the pacific rim including india 208 million in japan and 212 million in other nonus countries given the short maturities and investment grade quality of the portfolio holdings at september 30 2015  a hypothetical 10 change in interest rates would not materially affect the fair value of our cash and cash equivalents 

our invested cash is subject to interest rate fluctuations and for nonus operations foreign currency risk in a declining interest rate environment we would experience a decrease in interest income the opposite holds true in a rising interest rate environment over the past several years the us federal reserve board european central bank and bank of england have changed certain benchmark interest rates which have led to declines and increases in market interest rates these changes in market interest rates have resulted in fluctuations in interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents interest income will continue to fluctuate based on changes in market interest rates and levels of cash available for investment our consolidated cash balances were impacted unfavorably by 179 million  94 million  and 13 million  in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively due to changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar particularly the euro and the japanese yen

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend the following are important factors we have identified that could affect our future results you should consider them carefully when evaluating your investment in our shares or any forwardlooking statements made by us including those contained in this annual report because these factors could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or the performance projected in forwardlooking statements the risks described below are not the only risks we face additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business financial condition andor operating results 

i operational considerations 

our operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter making future operating results difficult to predict failure to meet market expectations could cause our stock price to decline 

our quarterly operating results historically have fluctuated and are likely to continue to fluctuate depending on a number of factors including 

 moreover we recently began offering customers the option of purchasing software licenses as a subscription under the subscription model significantly less license revenue is likely to be recognized at the time of sale than if the license had been 

purchased under our historical perpetual model in developing our earnings guidance and targets we have modeled a certain level of subscription license purchases however if a greater percentage of our customers elect to purchase licenses as subscriptions than we have assumed it will have an adverse impact on revenue operating margin cash flow and eps growth relative to our earnings guidance and targets 

accordingly our quarterly results are difficult to predict prior to the end of the quarter and we may be unable to confirm or adjust expectations with respect to our operating results for a particular quarter until that quarter has closed any failure to meet our quarterly revenue or earnings targets could adversely impact the market price of our stock 

our long range financial targets are predicated on revenue growth and operating margin improvements that we may fail to achieve which could reduce our expected earnings and cause us to fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors and cause our stock price to decline 

we are projecting revenue growth and operating margin improvements in our long range plan through 2018 our revenue projections include our expectations regarding revenue growth from sales of our cad extended plm eplm slm and iot products and acquired products we see the strongest growth potential in the iot and slm markets with more modest growth expectations for cad which comprised 43 of our revenue in 2014 and the market for which is mature and eplm we believe we can grow at or modestly faster than the markets in which we participate based on our technology leadership position in these markets we may not achieve planned revenue growth if the markets we serve do not grow at expected rates if we are not able to deliver solutions desired by customers and potential customers andor if acquired businesses do not generate the revenue growth that we expect 

we are projecting operating margin improvements predicated on operating leverage as revenue increases improved operating efficiencies particularly within our sales organization and service margin improvements services margins are significantly lower than license and support margins future projected improvements in our operating margin as a percent of revenue are based in part on our ability to improve services margins by reducing the amount of direct services that we perform through expansion of our service partner program and improving the profitability of services that we perform if our services revenue increases as a percentage of total revenue andor if we are unable to improve our services margins our overall operating margin may not increase to the levels we expect or may decrease additionally if we do not achieve lower sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue through productivity initiatives we may not achieve our operating margin targets if operating margins do not improve our earnings could be adversely affected and our stock price could decline 

global economic weakness may adversely affect our business  

the economies of markets outside the us in which we operate particularly europe japan and china are projected to grow at slower rates than the us if at all because approximately 60 of our revenue comes from outside the us weak conditions in those markets could adversely affect our business as customers in those markets may reduce or defer purchases of our products and services if the conditions in those markets do not improve or if they or the us economy deteriorates our business could be further adversely affected 

we depend on sales within the discrete manufacturing sector and our business could be adversely affected if manufacturing activity does not grow or if it contracts 

a large amount of our revenue is related to sales to customers in the discrete manufacturing sector if this economic sector does not grow or if it contracts our customers in this sector may reduce or defer purchases of our products and services which could adversely affect our business we expect that the manufacturing sector will be weak in europe and china in 2015 which could reduce our sales in these areas in 2015 and adversely impact our operating results for 2015 

a significant portion of our revenue is generated from support contracts decreases in support renewal rates or a decrease in the number of new licenses we sell would negatively impact our future support revenue and operating results 

a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from support contracts these contracts are generally renewed on an annual basis and typically have a high rate of customer renewal in addition to the recurring revenue base associated with these contracts a majority of customers purchasing new perpetual licenses also purchase related annual support contracts if the rate of renewal for these contracts or the sale of new licenses decreases our support revenue growth and profitability will be adversely affected 

we face significant competition which may reduce our profits and limit or reduce our market share 

the market for product development solutions and iot solutions is rapidly changing and very competitive and there has been a trend in industry consolidation among technology companies this competition could result in price reductions for our products and services reduced margins loss of customers and loss of market share our primary competition comes from 

 a breach of security in our products or computer systems could compromise the integrity of our products harm our reputation create additional liability and adversely impact our financial results 

we have implemented and continue to implement measures intended to maintain the security and integrity of our products source code and computer systems the potential consequences of a security breach or system disruption particularly through cyberattack or cyberintrusion including by computer hackers foreign governments and cyber terrorists have increased in scope as the number intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased a significant breach of the security andor integrity of our products or systems could prevent our products from functioning properly or could enable access to sensitive proprietary or confidential information including that of our customers without authorization this could require us to incur significant costs of remediation harm our reputation cause customers to stop buying our products and cause us to face lawsuits and potential liability which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

we must continually modify and enhance our products to keep pace with changing technology and to address our customers’ needs and expectations and any failure to do so could reduce demand for our products 

our ability to remain competitive will depend on our ability to enhance our current offerings and develop new products and services that keep pace with technological developments and meet evolving customer requirements in addition our solutions must meet customer expectations to be successful if our solutions fail to meet customer expectations customers may discontinue adoption of our solutions resulting in a loss of potential additional sales and we may be unable to retain existing customers or attract new customers 

our financial condition could be adversely affected if significant errors or defects are found in our software 

sophisticated software can sometimes contain errors defects or other performance problems if errors or defects are discovered in our current or future products we may need to expend significant financial technical and management resources or divert some of our development resources in order to resolve or work around those defects and we may not be able to correct them in a timely manner or provide an adequate response to our customers 

errors defects or other performance problems in our products could cause us to delay new product releases or customer deployments any such delays could cause delays in our ability to realize revenue from the licensing and shipment of new or enhanced products and give our competitors a greater opportunity to market competing products such difficulties could also cause us to lose customers technical problems or the loss of customers could also damage our business reputation and cause us to lose new business opportunities 

businesses we acquire may not generate the revenue and earnings we anticipated and may otherwise adversely affect our business 

we have acquired and intend to continue to acquire new businesses and technologies if we fail to successfully integrate and manage the businesses and technologies we acquire or if an acquisition does not further our business strategy as we expect our operating results may be adversely affected 

moreover business combinations also involve a number of risks and uncertainties that can adversely affect our operations and operating results including 

 7 

 our sales and operations are globally dispersed which exposes us to additional operating and compliance risks 

we sell and deliver software and services and maintain support operations in a large number of countries whose laws and practices differ from one another the americas accounted for 41 europe for 39 and asiapacific for 20 of our revenue in 2014 managing these geographically dispersed operations requires significant attention and resources to ensure compliance with laws accordingly while we strive to maintain a comprehensive compliance program we cannot guarantee that an employee agent or business partner will not act in violation of our policies or us or other applicable laws such violations can lead to civil andor criminal prosecutions substantial fines and the revocation of our rights to continue certain operations and also cause business and reputation loss for example as discussed in risk factors ii other considerations we are currently cooperating to provide information to the sec and department of justice in connection with an investigation concerning certain payments and expenses by certain business partners and employees in china that raise questions of compliance with laws including the us foreign corrupt practices act andor compliance with our business policies 

at times we provide extended payment terms to our customers which may be a factor in our customers’ purchasing decisions and our revenues could be adversely affected if we ceased making these terms available 

we have provided extended payment terms to certain customers in connection with transactions we have completed with them providing extended payment terms may positively influence our customers’ purchasing decisions but may reduce our cash flows in the shortterm if we reduce the amount of extended payment terms we provide to customers customers might reduce or defer the amount they spend on our products from the amount they might otherwise have spent if extended payment terms were available to them if this were to occur our revenue or revenue growth could be lower than in prior periods andor lower than we expect 

we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights 

our software products and trademarks including our company names product names and logos are proprietary we protect our intellectual property rights in these items by relying on copyrights trademarks patents and common law safeguards including trade secret protection as well as restrictions on disclosures and transferability contained in our agreements with other parties despite these measures the laws of all relevant jurisdictions may not afford adequate protection to our products and other intellectual property in addition we frequently encounter attempts by individuals and companies to pirate our software if our measures to protect our intellectual property rights fail others may be able to use those rights which could reduce our competitiveness and revenues 

intellectual property infringement claims could be asserted against us which could be expensive to defend and could result in limitations on our use of the claimed intellectual property 

the software industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding copyright patent and other intellectual property rights if a lawsuit of this type is filed it could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel we cannot be sure that we would prevail against any such asserted claims if we did not prevail we could be prevented from using the claimed intellectual property or be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements which might not be available on terms acceptable to us in addition to possible claims with respect to our proprietary products some of our products contain technology developed by and licensed from third parties and we may likewise be susceptible to infringement claims with respect to these thirdparty technologies 

our current research and development efforts may not generate revenue for several years if at all 

developing and localizing software products is expensive and the investment in product development often involves a long return on investment cycle we have made and expect to continue to make significant investments in research and development and related product opportunities that could adversely affect our operating results if not offset by revenue increases we believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position 

we may have exposure to additional tax liabilities and our effective tax rate may increase or fluctuate which could increase our income tax expense and reduce our net income 

as a multinational organization we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes in the us and in various foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision and other tax liabilities in the ordinary course of a global business there are many intercompany transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain our tax returns are subject to review by various taxing authorities although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes could be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 

our effective tax rate can be adversely affected by several factors many of which are outside of our control including 

 because we have substantial cash requirements in the united states and a significant portion of our cash is generated and held outside of the united states if our cash available in the united states and the cash available under our credit facility is insufficient to meet our operating expenses and debt repayment obligations in the united states we may be required to raise cash in ways that could negatively affect our financial condition results of operations and the market price of our common stock 

we have significant operations outside the united states as of september 30 2014 approximately 75 of our cash and cash equivalents balance was held by subsidiaries outside the united states with the remainder of the balance held by the us parent or its subsidiaries in the united states we believe that the combination of our existing united states cash and cash equivalents future united states operating cash flows and cash available under our credit facility are sufficient to meet our ongoing united states operating expenses and debt repayment obligations however if these sources of cash are insufficient to meet our future financial obligations in the united states we will be required to seek other available funding sources or means to repatriate cash to the united states which could negatively impact our results of operations financial position and the market price of our common stock 

our sales to government clients subject us to risks of funding approvals 

we derive revenues from contracts with the us government state and local governments and their respective agencies there is increased pressure for governments and their agencies to reduce spending many of our federal government contracts contain fiscal funding clauses whereby ongoing funding of the contracts is subject to approval of appropriations by the us congress similarly our contracts at the state and local levels are subject to government funding authorizations if additional funding for these contracts is not approved it could reduce revenue we have recognized and reduce future revenue from such contracts 

ii other considerations 

we have been investigating certain matters in china which matters and related remedial actions could have an adverse effect on our business and our results 

we have been cooperating to provide information to the us securities and exchange commission and the department of justice concerning payments and expenses by certain of our business partners in china andor by employees of our chinese subsidiary that raise questions concerning compliance with laws including the us foreign corrupt practices act our internal review is ongoing and we continue to respond to requests for information from these agencies including a subpoena issued to the company by the sec we cannot predict when or how this matter may be resolved resolution of this matter could include fines and penalties however we are unable to estimate an amount that could be associated with any resolution and accordingly we have not recorded a liability for this matter if resolution of this matter includes substantial fines or penalties this could materially impact our results for the period in which the associated liability is recorded or such amounts are paid further any settlement or other resolution of this matter could have collateral effects on our business in china the united states and elsewhere 

we terminated certain employees and business partners in china in connection with this matter which may have an adverse impact on our level of sales in china revenue from china has historically represented 5 to 7 of our total revenue 

we are required to comply with certain financial and operating covenants under our credit facility and to make scheduled debt payments as they become due any failure to comply with those covenants or to make scheduled payments could cause amounts borrowed under the facility to become immediately due and payable or prevent us from borrowing under the facility 

our credit facility which consists of a 500 million term loan and a 1 billion revolving loan and may be increased by an additional 250 million  in the form of revolving loans or term loans or a combination thereof if the existing or additional lenders are willing to make such increased commitments matures on september 15 2019 at which time any amounts outstanding will be due and payable in full as of september 30 2014 we had 612 million outstanding under the credit facility we may wish to borrow additional amounts under the facility in the future to support our operations including for strategic acquisitions and share repurchases 

we are required to comply with specified financial and operating covenants and to make scheduled repayments of our term loan which limit our ability to operate our business as we otherwise might operate it our failure to comply with any of these covenants or to meet any payment obligations under the facility could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived would result in any amounts outstanding including any accrued interest and unpaid fees becoming immediately due and payable we might not have sufficient working capital or liquidity to satisfy any repayment obligations in the event of an acceleration of those obligations in addition if we are not in compliance with the financial and operating covenants at the time we wish to borrow funds we will be unable to borrow funds at september 30 2014 we had 408 million available to borrow under the revolving loan portion of our credit facility the availability of which is limited based on financial covenants in the facility 

we may be unable to meet our goal of returning 40 of free cash flow to shareholders through share repurchases which could decrease your expected return on investment in ptc stock 

in august 2014 we announced a new capital allocation strategy a component of which is a longterm goal of returning approximately 40 of free cash flow cash flow from operations less capital expenditures to shareholders through share repurchases meeting this goal requires ptc to generate consistent free cash flow in the years ahead in an amount sufficient to enable us to continue investing in organic and inorganic growth as well as to return a significant portion of the cash generated to stockholders we may not meet this goal if we do not generate the free cash flow we expect or if we use our available cash to satisfy other priorities in addition our cash flow fluctuates over the course of the year and over multiple years so although our goal is to return 40 of free cash flow to shareholders that is an average over a longer term and the number of shares repurchased and amount of free cash flow returned in any given period will vary and may be more or less than 40 in any such period finally the number of shares repurchased for a given amount of cash will vary based on ptc’s stock price so the number of shares repurchased will not be a consistent or predictable number or percentage of outstanding stock 

our stock price has been volatile which may make it harder to resell your shares at a time and at a price that is favorable to you 

market prices for securities of software companies are generally volatile and are subject to significant fluctuations unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies the trading prices and valuations of these stocks and of ours may not be predictable negative changes in the public’s perception of the prospects of software companies or of ptc or the markets we serve could depress our stock price regardless of our operating results 

also a large percentage of our common stock is held by institutional investors purchases and sales of our common stock by these institutional investors could have a significant impact on the market price of the stock for more information about those investors please see our proxy statement with respect to our most recent annual meeting of stockholders and schedules 13d and 13g filed with the sec with respect to our common stock

executive overview 

in 2014 we made significant investments in the internet of things iot space with our acquisitions of thingworx and axeda which we believe has established us as a leader in the fastgrowing market for smart connected products our iot solutions combined with strong product offerings in our core cad plm alm and slm markets positions us to deliver new customer opportunities and accelerate growth in 2015 and beyond from a financial perspective in 2014 we achieved 5 revenue growth and 13 earnings per share eps growth 20 nongaap eps growth and we continued to deliver on our margin expansion strategy we achieved operating margins of 145 25 on a nongaap basis compared to 10 in 2013 22 on a nongaap basis the improvement in operating margin reflects continued vigilance on cost controls and cost savings from restructuring actions increased sales productivity improvements in services gross margins and lower restructuring charges these favorable effects on operating margin were partially offset by incremental costs from acquired businesses investments we are making in our iot business and annual merit salary increases for employees 

we delivered gaap eps of 134 for 2014 up from 119 for 2013 and nongaap eps of 217 up from 181 in 2013 our gaap results reflect tax benefits of 18 million in 2014 and 37 million in 2013 related to the reversal of a portion of the valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets in the us and a foreign jurisdiction as a result of accounting for acquisitions and an 8 million tax benefit in 2013 associated with accounting for our us pension plan nongaap measures are reconciled to gaap results under results of operations  nongaap measures  below 

for 2014 total revenue was up 5 year over year on an organic basis excluding revenue of 23 million from businesses acquired in 2014 and the fourth quarter of 2013 total revenue was up 3 year over year total license revenue for 2014 was 370 million an increase of 7 year over year on an organic basis excluding license revenue of 8 million from acquired businesses total license revenue was up 5 year over year our revenue in 2014 was adversely impacted by volatility in the global manufacturing industry from a geographic perspective organic license revenue in the americas and europe in 2014 was strong with double digit growth over 2013 in europe following declines in both regions from 2012 to 2013 we saw declines in japan license revenue in 2014 following double digit growth in 2013 due in part to unfavorable movements in the yen and higher large deals in japan in 2013 we saw double digit yearoveryear declines in license revenue in the pacific rim following modest growth in 2013 we believe results in the pacific rim including china were impacted by adverse macroeconomic conditions in that region our service revenue in 2014 was flat year over year down 3 on an organic basis which is in part due to expansion of our service partner program under which certain service opportunities are referred to partners our support revenue in 2014 was up 6 year over year up 5 on an organic basis 

we generated 305 million of cash from operations in 2014 up 36 from 225 million in 2013 and we borrowed 354 million under our credit facility to fund acquisitions and stock repurchases we used 324 million of cash to acquire thingworx atego and axeda and 225 million to repurchase stock at september 30 2014 the balance outstanding under our credit facility was 612 million and we had 408 million available to borrow under the revolving loan portion of our credit facility the availability of which is limited based on financial covenants in the facility we ended 2014 with 294 million of cash up from 242 million at the end 2013 

acquisitions 

as discussed above we acquired thingworx inc in the second quarter of 2014 for approximately 112 million and axeda corporation in the fourth quarter of 2014 for approximately 166 million thingworx is a small but highlyinnovative creator of an awardwinning platform to build and run applications designed to leverage the iot axeda is a developer of solutions to securely connect machines and sensors to the cloud axeda had historical annualized revenue of approximately 25 million 

as part of our strategy to supplement and expand our other businesses we also acquired atego group limited a europeanbased developer of modelbased systems and software engineering applications for approximately 46 million in cash on june 30 2014 atego enhances our portfolio of alm and plm solutions and strengthens our commitment to supporting our customers systems engineering initiatives atego had historical annualized revenue of approximately 20 million in the aggregate these 2014 acquisitions contributed 10 million to our 2014 revenue 

expanded share repurchase authorization and expanded credit facility 

on august 4 2014 we announced a capital allocation strategy that over time is expected to return approximately 40 of free cash flow to shareholders while still enabling us to invest in organic and new growth opportunities as part of this strategy our board of directors has authorized us to repurchase up to 600 million of our common shares through september 30 2017 under this authorization we borrowed 125 million under our credit facility to repurchase shares of our common stock in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 under an accelerated share repurchase asr agreement 

additionally in the fourth quarter of 2014 we entered into a new 15 billion credit facility with a syndicate of existing and new banks consisting of a 500 million term loan and a 1 billion revolving loan facility the new facility which replaced our previous 10 billion credit facility matures on september 15 2019 

restructuring of our workforce 

in the fourth quarter of 2014 in support of integrating businesses acquired in the past year and the continued evolution of our business model we committed to a plan to restructure our workforce and recorded a restructuring charge of 27 million attributable to termination benefits associated with 283 employees which will primarily be paid in fiscal 2015 we expect that the annualized cost savings of the restructuring actions will be approximately 30 million which effect is contemplated in our financial targets for fiscal 2015 

future expectations strategies and risks   

the slowdown in the global manufacturing industry uncertainty about the economic environment and volatility in foreign currency exchange rates are headwinds for revenue growth in fiscal 2015 while we saw indications of improvements in global manufacturing economic conditions in 2014 recent economic indicators raise renewed concerns about the economic climate particularly in europe china and japan because of this level of uncertainty and current unfavorable euro and yen to us dollar exchange rates relative to 2014 we expect only modest revenue growth in 2015 we expect an increase in nongaap operating margin to 26 through a combination of 1 increasing our nongaap professional services gross margin toward our longerterm goal of 20 by 2018 2 further expanding our professional services partner ecosystem to reduce professional services revenue as a percentage of total revenue 3 enhancing sales force productivity and efficiency 4 implementing solutions that require shorter sales cycles and less professional services 5 continued vigilance on cost control and 6 driving revenue growth across our existing markets while capitalizing on new opportunities such as the trend toward smart connected products and the internet of things 

for 2015 we expect yearoveryear revenue to grow 0 to 2 this revenue goal includes perpetual license  subscription solutions revenue growth of 4 to 10 support revenue growth of approximately 1 and a decline in professional services revenue of approximately 6 our 2015 earnings goals are to achieve nongaap operating margin expansion of 100 basis points from 25 in 2014 to 26 in 2015 expansion of gaap operating margins from approximately 14 in 2014 to 16 in 2015 and nongaap earnings per share of 233 to 240 gaap earnings per share of 133 to 140 if economic conditions do not improve or deteriorate further or if foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar differ significantly from our current assumed rates our results could differ materially from our targets our targets assume rates of 125 usd to one euro and 115 yen to one usd 

our 2015 targets exclude settlement losses related to the termination of our us pension plan while we expect to complete the termination process by september 30 2015 the amount of the losses and timing of the charge is subject to the timing of regulatory approvals and the projected benefit obligations and assets in the plan measured as of the dates the settlements occur we currently estimate the pretax settlement losses to be approximately 65 million 

also our results have been impacted and we expect will continue to be impacted by our ability to close large transactions the amount of revenue particularly license revenue attributable to large transactions and the number of such transactions may vary significantly from quarter to quarter based on customer purchasing decisions and macroeconomic conditions our growth rates have become increasingly dependent on adoption of our solutions by large direct customers such transactions tend to be larger in size and may have long lead times as they often follow a lengthy product selection and evaluation process this may cause volatility in our results 

a majority of our software license sales to date have been perpetual licenses where customers own the software license and revenue is recognized at the time of sale due to evolving customer preferences as well as acquisitions we have made in the iot and cloud services space a small but growing percentage of our business consists of ratably recognized subscriptions under a subscription customers do not own the software but pay a periodic fee for the right to use our software including access to technical support while we expect a significant majority of our customer base to continue to purchase our software solutions under a perpetual licensing arrangement we are also offering subscription pricing as an option for most products starting in 2015 through 2014 we reported revenue by three lines of business 1 license 2 service and 3 support beginning in the first quarter of 2015 we plan to report revenue as follows 1 perpetual license  subscription solutions which includes subscription revenue and cloud services 2 support and 3 professional services previously cloud services revenue was reported in services revenue the revenue targets below reflect this revised reporting structure if a greater percentage of our customers elect our subscription offering than our base case assumption it will have an adverse impact on revenue operating margin cash flow and eps growth relative to our targets above 

impact of an investigation in china 

we have been cooperating to provide information to the us securities and exchange commission and the department of justice concerning payments and expenses by certain of our business partners in china andor by employees of our chinese subsidiary that raise questions concerning compliance with laws including the us foreign corrupt practices act our internal review is ongoing and we continue to respond to requests for information from these agencies including a subpoena issued to the company by the sec we cannot predict when or how this matter may be resolved resolution of this matter could include fines and penalties however we are unable to estimate an amount that could be associated with any resolution and accordingly we have not recorded a liability for this matter if resolution of this matter includes substantial fines or penalties this could materially impact our results for the period in which the associated liability is recorded or such amounts are paid further any settlement or other resolution of this matter could have collateral effects on our business in china the united states and elsewhere 

we terminated certain employees and business partners in china in connection with this matter which may have an adverse impact on our level of sales in china revenue from china has historically represented 5 to 7 of our total revenue

the following table shows the financial measures that we consider the most significant indicators of the performance of our business in addition to providing operating income operating margin and diluted earnings per share as calculated under generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” it shows nongaap operating income operating margin and diluted earnings per share for the reported periods these nongaap measures exclude fair value adjustments related to acquired deferred revenue acquired deferred costs stockbased compensation expense amortization of acquired intangible assets expense acquisitionrelated and pension plan termination costs restructuring charges certain identified gains or charges included in nonoperating other income expense and the related tax effects of the preceding items as well as the tax items identified these nongaap measures provide investors another view of our operating results that is aligned with management budgets and with performance criteria in our incentive compensation plans management uses and investors should use nongaap measures in conjunction with our gaap results we discuss the nongaap measures in detail under nongaap measures  below 

  



  

 

results of operations 

acquisitions 

in 2014 we acquired thingworx on december 30 atego on june 30 and axeda on august 11 these acquisitions added 98 million 110 million on a nongaap basis to our 2014 revenue in 2013 we completed the acquisitions of servigistics enigma and netideas servigistics acquired on october 2 2012 enigma and netideas both acquired in the fourth quarter of 2013 added 949 million  979 million on a nongaap basis to our 2013 revenue substantially all of which is included in slm revenue 

impact of foreign currency exchange on results of operations 

approximately two thirds of our revenue and half of our expenses are transacted in currencies other than the us dollar currency translation affects our reported results because we report our results of operations in us dollars changes in currency exchange rates particularly for the yen and the euro compared to the prior year increased revenue and decreased expenses in 2014 with lower revenue and expenses in japan offset by higher revenue and expenses in europe and reduced both revenue and expenses in 2013 if actual reported results were converted into us dollars based on the corresponding prior year’s foreign currency exchange rates 2014 and 2013 revenue would have been lower by 21 million and higher by 182 million respectively and expenses would have been higher by 09 million and 88 million respectively the net impact on yearoveryear results would have been a decrease in operating income of 30 million in 2014 and an increase in operating income of 94 million in 2013 the results of operations revenue by line of business and revenue by geographic region in the tables that follow present both actual percentage changes year over year and percentage changes on a constant currency basis

the amount of license revenue attributable to large transactions and the number of such transactions may vary significantly from period to period and by geographic region we had six transactions with license revenue in excess of 5 million in 2014 four in the americas and two in europe three in 2013 two in japan and one in the americas and four in 2012 two in the americas and two in europe 

2014 compared to 2013 

in 2014 compared to the yearago period license revenue was up 7 and organic license revenue grew 5 license revenue in 2014 from axeda atego thingworx enigma and netideas was 81 million 

license revenue was strongest in europe with 29 yearoveryear growth 26 on a constant currency basis and our cad and eplm businesses offsetting yearoveryear declines in the pacific rim region which was down 17 and the slm business cad license revenue of 169 million represented our strongest year since 2011  driven by double digit yearoveryear growth in creo modules and upgrades training software and certain heritage products we expect more subdued growth in cad revenue in 2015 eplm license revenue of 162 million grew 8 year over year on a reported and constant currency basis and 7 on an organic constant currency basis scm saw strong double digit license growth plm license sales increased by 5 and the increase in alm was comparable to the overall performance of eplm on an organic constant currency basis slm license revenue declined 22 year over year on a reported and constant currency basis and 27 on an organic constant currency basis slm license revenue in 2014 was affected by a slowerthanexpected rebuild of our pipeline after a strong 2013 looking ahead to 2015 we believe our slm business can reach double digit license growth

2013 compared to 2012 

the decline in license revenue in 2013 reflected yearoveryear declines of 2 in the americas and 12 in europe these declines were partially offset by growth in japan of 32 58 on a constant currency basis and an increase in the pacific rim of 3 results reflected softness in europe resulting in lower license revenue from large license transactions particularly sales of eplm products which we attribute to macroeconomic conditions in that region 

organic license revenue in 2013 was down 9 on a yearoveryear basis license revenue from businesses acquired in 2013 which was the primary contributor to growth in slm license revenue in 2013 was 268 million

service revenue 

consulting and training services engagements typically result from sales of new licenses particularly of our eplm and slm solutions expanding our service partner program under which service engagements are referred to third party service providers is part of our overall margin expansion strategy additionally over time we anticipate implementing solutions that require less services as a result we do not expect that the amount of services we deliver will increase proportionately with license revenue increases consulting and cloud services revenue has represented approximately 85 of total service revenue and training revenue has represented approximately 15 of total services revenue 

2014 compared to 2013 

year over year service revenue in 2014 was flat down 3 on an organic basis in 2014 our consulting service revenue was flat year over year down 4 on an organic basis year over year training revenue was up 2 08 million in 2014

revenue from individual customers 

we enter into customer contracts that may result in revenue being recognized over multiple reporting periods accordingly revenue recognized in a current period may be attributable to contracts entered into during the current period or in prior periods license andor service revenue of 1 million or more recognized from individual customers in a single quarter during the fiscal year from contracts entered into during that quarter andor a prior quarter is shown in the table below the amount of revenue particularly license revenue attributable to such large transactions and the number of such transactions may vary significantly from quarter to quarter based on customer purchasing decisions the completion of large services engagements commenced in previous quarters and macroeconomic conditions 

revenue from large transactions in 2014 compared to 2013 was higher in the americas and europe we believe that the results in the americas and europe reflect more favorable economic conditions in those regions revenue from large transactions in 2013 compared to 2012 was higher in japan and the pacific rim and lower in the americas and europe the license revenue portion of this measure was 55 in 2014 compared to 48 in 2013 and 44 in 2012 



revenue by geographic region 

  



a significant percentage of our annual revenue comes from large customers in the broader manufacturing space as a result license revenue growth in our core cad and eplm products historically has correlated to growth in broader measures of the global manufacturing economy including gdp industrial production and manufacturing pmi current indicators suggest the us manufacturing economy is in the early stages of recovery though the pace and timing remain uncertain nearly 60 of our annual revenue is outside the us where manufacturing indicators appear to be weaker gdp and pmi data in the eurozone and japan suggest manufacturing economies in those regions are slowing while manufacturing activity in china remains subdued versus earlier levels for 2015 our financial targets assume a slower rate of growth in the manufacturing economies of europe japan and the pacific rim relative to the us

gross margin 



gross margin as a percentage of total revenue in 2014 compared to the yearago period reflects higher license and services margins the increases in our gaap service gross margin since 2012 were due in part to improved consulting margin service margins have improved due to cost reductions improved efficiencies and a reduction in the amount of direct services that we perform through expansion of our service partner program service margin in 2014 reflects improvements in the first half of the year offset by a decrease in the second half due in part to excess capacity which we addressed with our restructuring actions in the fourth quarter additionally we are making investments in select strategic customer engagements which we expect to continue to unfavorably impact service margins in the first half of 2015 service revenue comprised 22 of our total revenue in 2014 compared to 23 in 2013 and 24 in 2012

the increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets in 2013 was primarily due to our acquisition of servigistics

in september 2014 in support of integrating businesses acquired in the past year and the continued evolution of our business model we committed to a plan to restructure our workforce and recorded a restructuring charge of 268 million attributable to termination benefits associated with 283 employees which will primarily be paid in fiscal 2015 we expect that the annualized cost savings of the restructuring actions will be approximately 30 million which effect is contemplated in our financial targets for fiscal 2015 in addition in 2014 we recorded restructuring charges of 16 million primarily associated with the completion of the restructuring actions initiated in the fourth quarter of 2013

nonoperating income expense 



foreign currency net losses foreign currency net losses include costs of hedging contracts certain realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains or losses and foreign exchange gains or losses resulting from the required periodend currency remeasurement of the assets and liabilities of our subsidiaries that use the us dollar as their functional currency because a large portion of our revenue and expenses is transacted in foreign currencies we engage in hedging transactions involving the use of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates foreign currency losses in 2012 included 08 million related to mks legal entity mergers 

interest income interest income represents earnings on the investment of our available cash balances and interest on financing provided to customers as described in note b summary of significant accounting policies  of notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report 

interest expense interest expense is primarily related to interest on borrowings under our credit facility the increase in interest expense in 2014 and 2013 compared to the respective prior year is due to higher average amounts outstanding under our credit facility in those years we had 612 million  outstanding under the credit facility at september 30 2014 compared to 258 million at september 30 2013 and 370 million at september 30 2012 which included 230 million in proceeds drawn from our credit facility in the fourth quarter of 2012 to finance the servigistics acquisition which closed on october 2 2012 the balance outstanding at september 30 2014 reflects amounts borrowed in 2014 for our acquisitions of thingworx and axeda and 125 million borrowed in the fourth quarter of 2014 to finance our accelerated share repurchase transaction the average interest rate on amounts outstanding under the credit facility was 16  in 2014 17 in 2013 and 18 in 2012 

other income expense net the change in other income expense net in 2014 and 2013 compared to 2012 was due primarily to a legal settlement gain of 51 million recorded in 2013 

income taxes 



in 2014  our effective tax rate was lower than the 35  statutory federal income tax rate due to our corporate structure in which our foreign taxes are at a net effective tax rate lower than the us rate and the reversal of a portion of our valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets described below other factors impacting the rate include foreign withholding taxes of 51 million  and the establishment of a valuation allowance totaling 35 million  in two foreign subsidiaries 

in 2013 our effective tax rate was lower than the 35 statutory federal income tax rate due in large part to the reversal of a portion of the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets primarily the us we recorded benefits of 367 million resulting from 2013 acquisitions as described below and a benefit of 79 million related to the release of a valuation allowance as a result of a pension gain recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in equity additionally our 2013 tax provision reflects a 20 million  provision related to a research and development rd cost sharing prepayment by a foreign subsidiary to the us a similar prepayment was made in 2012 resulting in a 78 million  provision in that year this impact was offset by a corresponding increase in our valuation allowance in the us other factors impacting the rate include our corporate structure in which our foreign taxes are at an effective tax rate lower than the us rate foreign withholding taxes of 60 million and noncash tax benefits of 53 million recorded as a result of the conclusion of tax audits in several foreign jurisdictions 

acquisitions in 2014 and 2013 were accounted for as business combinations assets acquired including the fair value of acquired tangible assets intangible assets and assumed liabilities were recorded and we recorded net deferred tax liabilities of 216 million  and 387 million  in 2014 and 2013 respectively primarily related to the tax effect of the acquired intangible assets that are not deductible for income tax purposes these deferred tax liabilities reduced our net deferred tax asset balance and resulted in a tax benefit of 181 million and 367 million in 2014 and 2013 respectively to decrease our valuation allowance in jurisdictions where we have recorded a valuation allowance as these decreases in the valuation allowance are not part of the accounting for business combinations the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed they were recorded as an income tax benefit 

in 2012 our effective tax rate was higher than the 35 statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to the recording of a 1245 million charge to the income tax provision related to the establishment of a valuation allowance on us net deferred tax assets as described below this increase was offset in part as a result of our corporate structure in which our foreign taxes are at an effective tax rate lower than the us rate our 2012 provision included a noncash charge of 42 million related to the restructuring of our canadian operations that resulted in a change in the tax status of the foreign legal entity and a noncash charge of 14 million related to the impact of a japanese legislative change on our japan entitys deferred tax assets these charges were excluded from our nongaap earnings per share see nongaap measures  below additionally our 2012 tax provision reflects a 78 million provision related to a research and development cost sharing prepayment by a foreign subsidiary to the us a comparable prepayment was made in 2011 

in the fourth quarter of 2012 we recorded a 1245 million  noncash charge to the income tax provision to establish a valuation allowance against substantially all of our us net deferred tax assets we weighed all available evidence both positive and negative and concluded that it was more likely than not a likelihood of more than 50 percent that substantially all of our us deferred tax assets will not be realized the realization of deferred tax assets including carryforwards and deductible temporary differences depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the same character during the carryback or carryforward period we considered all sources of taxable income available to realize the deferred tax assets including the future reversal of existing temporary differences future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards taxable income in prior carryback years and taxplanning strategies 

on september 30 2014 we executed a business realignment in which intellectual property was transferred between two whollyowned foreign subsidiaries the realignment allows us to more efficiently manage the distribution of our products to european customers there was no impact to the tax provision for this transaction in 2014 however we expect this realignment to result in an annual tax benefit of approximately 15 million to 20 million for the next several years declining annually thereafter through 2021 

in the normal course of business ptc and its subsidiaries are examined by various taxing authorities including the internal revenue service irs in the united states we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax 

authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate we are currently under audit by tax authorities in several jurisdictions audits by tax authorities typically involve examination of the deductibility of certain permanent items limitations on net operating losses and tax credits although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in material changes in our estimates 

our future effective income tax rate may be materially impacted by the amount of income taxes associated with our foreign earnings which are taxed at rates different from the us federal statutory income tax rate as well as the timing and extent of the realization of deferred tax assets and changes in the tax law further our tax rate may fluctuate within a fiscal year including from quarter to quarter due to items arising from discrete events including settlements of tax audits and assessments the resolution or identification of tax position uncertainties and acquisitions of other companies 

nongaap measures 

the nongaap measures presented in the above discussion of our results of operations and the respective most directly comparable gaap measures are 

 the nongaap measures exclude fair value adjustments related to acquired deferred revenue acquired deferred costs stockbased compensation expense amortization of acquired intangible assets expense acquisitionrelated charges restructuring charges pension plan terminationrelated costs identified discrete items included in nonoperating other income expense net and the related tax effects of the preceding items and any other identified tax items these items are normally included in the comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 

fair value of acquired deferred revenue  is a purchase accounting adjustment recorded to reduce acquired deferred revenue to the fair value of the remaining obligation 

stockbased compensation expense  is noncash expense relating to stockbased awards issued to executive officers employees and outside directors consisting of restricted stock stock options and restricted stock units 

amortization of acquired intangible assets expense  is a noncash expense that is impacted by the timing and magnitude of our acquisitions we believe the assessment of our operations excluding these costs is relevant to our assessment of internal operations and comparisons to the performance of other companies in our industry 

charges included in general and administrative expenses include acquisitionrelated charges and pension plan terminationrelated costs acquisitionrelated charges include direct costs of potential and completed acquisitions and expenses related to acquisition integration activities including transaction fees due diligence costs severance and professional fees in addition subsequent adjustments to our initial estimated amount of contingent consideration associated with specific acquisitions are included within acquisitionrelated charges these costs are not considered part of our normal operations as the occurrence and amount will vary depending on the timing and size of acquisitions in the second quarter of 2014 we began the process of terminating a us pension plan costs associated with the termination are not considered part of our ongoing operations 

restructuring charges  include excess facility restructuring charges and severance costs resulting from reductions of personnel driven by modifications to our business strategy and not as part of our normal operations these costs may vary in size based on our restructuring plan 

we use these nongaap measures and we believe that they assist our investors to make periodtoperiod comparisons of our operational performance because they provide a view of our operating results without items that are not in our view indicative of our core operating results we believe that these nongaap measures help illustrate underlying trends in our business and we use the measures to establish budgets and operational goals communicated internally and externally for managing our business and evaluating our performance we believe that providing nongaap measures affords investors a view of our operating results that may be more easily compared to the results of peer companies in addition compensation of our executives is based in part on the performance of our business based on these nongaap measures 

the items excluded from the nongaap measures often have a material impact on our financial results and such items often recur accordingly the nongaap measures included in this annual report should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for or superior to the comparable measures prepared in accordance with gaap 

the following tables reconcile each of these nongaap measures to its most closely comparable gaap measure on our financial statements 

  



  

 critical accounting policies and estimates 

we have prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america in preparing our financial statements we make estimates assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our reported revenues results of operations and net income as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet these estimates assumptions and judgments are necessary because future events and their effects on our results and the value of our assets cannot be determined with certainty and are made based on our historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances these estimates may change as new events occur or additional information is obtained and we may periodically be faced with uncertainties the outcomes of which are not within our control and may not be known for a prolonged period of time 

the accounting policies methods and estimates used to prepare our financial statements are described generally in note b summary of significant accounting policies  of “notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report the most important accounting judgments and estimates that we made in preparing the financial statements involved 

 a critical accounting policy is one that is both material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires us to make subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies require us to make assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time of the estimate and different estimates that we could have used or changes in the estimates that are reasonably likely to occur may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process actual results could differ from those estimates 

accounting policies guidelines and interpretations related to our critical accounting policies and estimates are generally subject to numerous sources of authoritative guidance and are often reexamined by accounting standards rule makers and regulators these rule makers andor regulators may promulgate interpretations guidance or regulations that may result in changes to our accounting policies which could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 

revenue recognition 

we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with determining the amounts of software license and services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period 

our primary judgments involve the following 

 we derive revenues from three primary sources 1 software licenses 2 support and 3 services 

we recognize revenue when 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 2 delivery has occurred generally fob shipping point or electronic distribution 3 the fee is fixed or determinable and 4 collection is probable 

our software is distributed primarily through our direct sales force in addition we have an indirect distribution channel through alliances with resellers revenue arrangements with resellers are recognized on a sellthrough basis that is when we deliver the product to the enduser customer we record consideration given to a reseller as a reduction of revenue to the extent we have recorded revenue from the reseller we do not offer contractual rights of return stock balancing or price protection to our resellers and actual product returns from them have been insignificant to date as a result we do not maintain reserves for reseller product returns 

at the time of each sale transaction we must make an assessment of the collectability of the amount due from the customer revenue is only recognized at that time if management deems that collection is probable in making this assessment we consider customer creditworthiness and historical payment experience at that same time we assess whether fees are fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties in assessing whether the fee is fixed or determinable we consider the payment terms of the transaction including transactions with payment terms that extend beyond our customary payment terms and our collection experience in similar transactions without making concessions among other factors we have periodically provided financing to creditworthy customers with payment terms up to 24 months if the fee is determined not to be fixed or determinable revenue is recognized only as payments become due from the customer provided that all other revenue recognition criteria are met our software license arrangements generally do not include customer acceptance provisions however if an arrangement includes an acceptance provision we record revenue only upon the earlier of 1 receipt of written acceptance from the customer or 2 expiration of the acceptance period 

our software arrangements often include implementation and consulting services that are sold under consulting engagement contracts or as part of the software license arrangement when we determine that such services are not essential to the functionality of the licensed software we record revenue separately for the license and service elements of these arrangements provided that appropriate evidence of fair value exists for the undelivered services see discussion below generally we consider that a service is not essential to the functionality of the software based on various factors including if the services may be provided by independent third parties experienced in providing such consulting and implementation in coordination with dedicated customer personnel and whether the services result in significant modification or customization of the software functionality when consulting services qualify for separate accounting consulting revenues under time and materials billing arrangements are recognized as the services are performed consulting revenues under fixedpriced contracts are generally recognized as the services are performed using a proportionate performance model with hours or costs as the input method of attribution when we provide consulting services considered essential to the functionality of the software the arrangement does not qualify for separate accounting of the license and service elements and the license revenue is recognized together with the consulting services using the percentageofcompletion method of contract accounting under such arrangements consideration is recognized as the services are performed as measured by an observable input in these circumstances we separate license revenue from service revenue for income statement presentation by allocating vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value of the consulting services as service revenue and the residual portion as license revenue under the percentageofcompletion method we estimate the stage of completion of contracts with fixed or 

“not to exceed” fees based on hours or costs incurred to date as compared with estimated total project hours or costs at completion adjustments to estimates to complete are made in the periods in which facts resulting in a change become known when total cost estimates exceed revenues we accrue for the estimated losses when identified the use of the proportionate performance and percentageofcompletion methods of accounting require significant judgment relative to estimating total contract costs or hours hours being a proxy for costs including assumptions relative to the length of time to complete the project the nature and complexity of the work to be performed and anticipated changes in salaries and other costs 

we generally use the residual method to recognize revenue from software arrangements that include one or more elements to be delivered at a future date when evidence of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists and the elements of the arrangement qualify for separate accounting as described above under the residual method the fair value of the undelivered elements ie support and services based on vsoe is deferred and the remaining portion of the total arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements ie software license if evidence of the fair value of one or more of the undelivered elements does not exist all revenues are deferred and recognized when delivery of all of those elements has occurred or when fair values can be established we determine vsoe of the fair value of services and support revenue based upon our recent pricing for those elements when sold separately for certain transactions vsoe of the fair value of support revenue is determined based on a substantive support renewal clause within a customer contract our current pricing practices are influenced primarily by product type purchase volume sales channel and customer location we review services and support sold separately on a periodic basis and update when appropriate our vsoe of fair value for such elements to ensure that it reflects our recent pricing experience 

generally our contracts are accounted for individually however when contracts are closely interrelated and dependent on each other it may be necessary to account for two or more contracts as one to reflect the substance of the group of contracts 

for subscriptionbased licenses license revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement in limited circumstances where the right to use the software license is contingent upon current payments of support fees for software license and support are recognized ratably over the initial support term 

support contracts generally include rights to unspecified upgrades when and if available telephone and internetbased support updates and bug fixes support revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the support contract on a straightline basis 

reimbursements of outofpocket expenditures incurred in connection with providing consulting services are included in service revenue with the offsetting expense recorded in cost of service revenue 

training services include onsite and classroom training training revenues are recognized as the related training services are provided 

accounting for income taxes 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to calculate our income tax expense based on taxable income by jurisdiction there are many transactions and calculations about which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain as a result our calculations involve estimates by management some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenuesharing costreimbursement and transfer pricing arrangements among related entities and the differing tax treatment of revenue and cost items across various jurisdictions if we were compelled to revise or to account differently for our arrangements that revision could affect our tax liability 

the income tax accounting process also involves estimating our actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheets we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized we must establish a valuation allowance as a charge to income tax expense 

as of september 30 2014 we have a valuation allowance of 1440 million against net deferred tax assets in the us and a valuation allowance of 335 million against net deferred tax assets in certain foreign jurisdictions in the fourth quarter of 2012 we recorded a 1245 million  noncash charge to the income tax provision to establish a valuation allowance against substantially all of our us net deferred tax assets we weighed all available evidence both positive and negative and concluded that it was more likely than not a likelihood of more than 50 percent that substantially all of our us deferred tax assets will not be realized the realization of deferred tax assets including carryforwards and deductible temporary differences depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the same character during the carryback or carryforward period we considered all sources of taxable income available to realize the deferred tax assets including the future reversal of existing 

temporary differences future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards taxable income in prior carryback years and taxplanning strategies 

the valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets of certain foreign jurisdictions is established primarily for our net operating loss carryforwards the majority of which do not expire there are limitations imposed on the utilization of such net operating losses that could further restrict the recognition of any tax benefits 

we have not provided for us income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on foreign unrepatriated earnings as it is our current intention to permanently reinvest these earnings outside the us unless it can be done with no significant tax cost if we decide to change this assertion in the future to repatriate any additional nonus earnings we may be required to establish a deferred tax liability on such earnings 

in the normal course of business ptc and its subsidiaries are examined by various taxing authorities including the internal revenue service irs in the united states we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate we are currently under audit by tax authorities in several jurisdictions audits by tax authorities typically involve examination of the deductibility of certain permanent items limitations on net operating losses and tax credits although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in material changes in our estimates 

valuation of assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations 

in accordance with business combination accounting we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values determining these fair values requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets 

our identifiable intangible assets acquired consist of developed technology core technology tradenames customer lists and contracts and software support agreements and related relationships developed technology consists of products that have reached technological feasibility core technology represents a combination of processes inventions and trade secrets related to the design and development of acquired products customer lists and contracts and software support agreements and related relationships represent the underlying relationships and agreements with customers of the acquired company’s installed base we have generally valued intangible assets using a discounted cash flow model critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to 

 in addition we estimate the useful lives of our intangible assets based upon the expected period over which we anticipate generating economic benefits from the related intangible asset 

net tangible assets consist of the fair values of tangible assets less the fair values of assumed liabilities and obligations except for deferred revenues net tangible assets were generally valued by us at the respective carrying amounts recorded by the acquired company if we believed that their carrying values approximated their fair values at the acquisition date the values assigned to deferred revenue reflect an amount equivalent to the estimated cost plus an appropriate profit margin to perform the services related to the acquired company’s software support contracts 

in addition uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date and we reevaluate these items quarterly with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill provided that we are within the measurement period up to one year from the acquisition date and we continue to collect information in order to determine their estimated values subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the estimated value of uncertain tax positions or tax related valuation allowances whichever comes first changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations 

our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable at that time but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions estimates or actual results 

when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a finitelived intangible asset may not be recoverable we perform an assessment of the asset for potential impairment this assessment is based on projected undiscounted future cash flows over the asset’s remaining life if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its undiscounted cash flows we record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset determined using projected discounted future cash flows of the asset 

valuation of goodwill 

our goodwill totaled 10125 million and 7691 million  as of september 30 2014 and 2013 respectively we have two operating segments 1 software products and 2 services we assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level our reporting units are determined based on the components of our operating segments that constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and for which operating results are regularly reviewed by segment management our reporting units are consistent with our operating segments as of september 30 2014 and 2013 goodwill and acquired intangible assets in the aggregate attributable to our software products reportable segment was 12830 million  and 9793 million  respectively and attributable to our services reportable segment was 664 million  and 629 million  respectively we test goodwill for impairment in the third quarter of our fiscal year or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting segment below its carrying value factors we consider important on an overall company basis and reportable segment basis as applicable that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results significant changes in our use of the acquired assets or a significant change in the strategy for our business significant negative industry or economic trends a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period or a reduction of our market capitalization relative to net book value 

 we completed our annual goodwill impairment review as of june 28 2014  and concluded that no impairment charge was required as of that date to conduct our test of goodwill the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value if the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value we record an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value of goodwill and its implied fair value we estimate the fair values of our reporting units using discounted cash flow valuation models those models require estimates of future revenues profits capital expenditures working capital terminal values based on revenue multiples and discount rates for each reporting unit we estimate these amounts by evaluating historical trends current budgets operating plans and industry data the estimated fair value of each reporting unit was more than double its carrying value as of june 28 2014  

accounting for pensions 

we sponsor several us and international pension plans we make assumptions that are used in calculating the expense and liability of these plans these key assumptions include the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate used to determine the present value of benefit obligations in selecting the expected longterm rate of return on assets we consider the average future rate of earnings expected on the funds invested to provide for the benefits under the pension plan this includes considering the plans asset allocations and the expected returns likely to be earned over the life of the plans the discount rate reflects the estimated rate at which an amount that is invested in a portfolio of highquality debt instruments would provide the future cash flows necessary to pay benefits when they come due the actuarial assumptions used by us may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions or longer or shorter life spans of the participants our actual results could differ materially from those we estimated which could require us to record a greater amount of pension expense in future years andor require higher than expected cash contributions 

we maintain a us defined benefit pension plan the plan that covers certain persons who were employees of computervision corporation acquired by us in 1998 benefits under the plan were frozen in 1990 in the second quarter of 2014 we began the process of terminating the plan which will include settling plan liabilities by offering lump sum distributions to plan participants and purchasing annuity contracts to cover vested benefits we expect to complete the termination process by september 30 2015 

as of september 30 2014 we have valued the projected benefit obligations for our us plan based on the present value of estimated costs to settle the liabilities through a combination of lump sum payments to beneficiaries and purchasing annuities from an insurance company this reflects an estimate of how many participants we expect will accept a lump sum offering and an estimate of lump sum payouts for those participants based on the current lump sum rates approved by the irs liabilities expected to be settled through the purchase of annuity contracts have been estimated based on future benefit payments discounted based on current interest rates that correspond to the liability payouts adjusted to reflect a premium that would be assessed by the insurer we expect to settle the liabilities by the end of fiscal 2015 as the liabilities are settled losses currently estimated to be approximately 65 million  will be recognized up to the amount of unamortized losses in accumulated other comprehensive income based on the projected benefit obligations measured as of the dates the settlements occur prior to settling the liabilities we will contribute such additional amounts currently estimated to be approximately 25 

million  as may be necessary to fully fund the plan such contributions are expected to be made concurrent with settling the liabilities but may be made earlier at our discretion 

as of september 30 2014 and 2013 the us discount rate was determined using a bondmatching tool under this tool discount rates are derived by identifying a theoretical settlement portfolio of high quality bonds sufficient to provide for the pension plans projected benefit payments a single rate is then determined that results in a discounted value of the plans benefit payments that equates to the market value of the selected bonds    in determining our us pension cost for 2014 2013 and 2012 we used a discount rate of 490  400  and 450  respectively and an expected return on plan assets of 725 for all three years 

certain of our international subsidiaries principally germany also sponsor pension plans accounting and reporting for these plans requires the use of countryspecific assumptions for discount rates and expected rates of return on assets we apply a consistent methodology in determining the key assumptions that in addition to future experience assumptions such as mortality rates are used by our actuaries to determine our liability and expense for each of these plans the discount rate for germany was selected with reference to a spotrate yield curve based on the yields of aarated eurodenominated corporate bonds in addition our actuarial consultants determine the expense and liabilities of the plan using other assumptions for future experience such as mortality rates in determining our pension cost for 2014 2013 and 2012 we used weighted average discount rates of 33  34  and 48  respectively and weighted average expected returns on plan assets of 57  54  and 54  respectively in 2014  2013 and 2012 our actual return on plan assets for all plans was 159 million  136 million  and 165 million respectively if actual returns are below our expected rates of return it will impact the amount and timing of future contributions and expense for these plans we expect lower rates of return in 2015 because we transferred us plan assets from equities to fixed income securities in 2014 in contemplation of terminating the plan and distributing assets from the plan 

as of september 30 2014 and 2013 our plans in total were underfunded representing the difference between our projected benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets by 612 million  and 501 million  respectively the projected benefit obligation as of september 30 2014 was determined using a discount rate of 38  for the us plan and a weighted average discount rate of 24  for our international plans the most sensitive assumptions used in calculating the expense and liability of our pension plans are the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets total gaap net periodic pension cost was 33 million  in 2014 and we expect it to be approximately 8 million  in 2015 the increase in gaap pension cost in 2015 is due primarily to lower expected returns on us plan assets as described above a 50 basis point change to our discount rate and expected return on plan assets assumptions would have changed our pension expense for the year ended september 30 2014 by approximately 1 million a 50 basis point decrease in our discount rate assumptions would increase our projected benefit obligation as of september 30 2014 by approximately 16 million 

legal contingencies 

we are periodically subject to various legal claims and involved in various legal proceedings we routinely review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any matter is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we record a liability for the estimated loss significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether the amount of an exposure is reasonably estimable because of inherent uncertainties related to these legal matters we base our loss accruals on the best information available at the time further estimates of this nature are highly subjective and the final outcome of these matters could vary significantly from the amounts that have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as additional information becomes available we reassess our potential liability and may revise our estimates such revisions could have a material impact on future quarterly or annual results of operations 

liquidity and capital resources 

  



we invest our cash with highly rated financial institutions and in diversified domestic and international money market mutual funds the portfolio is invested in shortterm instruments to ensure cash is available to meet requirements as needed at september 30 2014  cash and cash equivalents totaled 2937 million  up from 2419 million  at september 30 2013 reflecting 3046 million  in operating cash flow 3538 million  of net amounts borrowed under our credit facility 110 million borrowed in the first quarter of 2014 for our acquisition of thingworx 295 million borrowed in the fourth quarter for our acquisition of axeda and our accelerated share repurchase transaction net of amounts repaid in the second and third quarters of 2014 partially offset by 3235 million  used for our acquisitions of axeda atego and thingworx and 2249 million  used to repurchase common shares outstanding 

cash provided by operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities was 3046 million  in 2014 compared to 2247 million  in 2013 and 2180 million in 2012 cash provided by operations was higher due to higher earnings pretax income was 1861 million in 2014 compared to 1262 million in 2013 and 1207 million in 2012 lower restructuring payments 206 million in 2014 compared to 372 million in 2013 and 209 million in 2012 and lower income tax payments cash paid for income taxes was 255 million  354 million  and 530 million  in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively 

accounts receivable days sales outstanding was 58 days as of september 30 2014 compared to 60 days as of september 30 2013 and 61 days as of september 30 2012 we periodically provide financing with payment terms up to 24 months to creditworthy customers other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets include noncurrent receivables from customers related to extended payment term contracts totaling 135 million  and 170 million  at september 30 2014 and 2013 respectively we periodically transfer future payments under customer contracts to thirdparty financial institutions on a nonrecourse basis we sold 245 million  of receivables in 2014  compared to 170 million  in 2013  and 143 million in 2012 

cash used by investing activities   



in in the fourth quarter 2014 we acquired axeda and atego for 1659 million  and 461 million  respectively net of cash acquired and in the second quarter of 2014 we acquired thingworx for 1115 million  net of cash acquired in the first quarter of 2013 we acquired servigistics inc for 2208 million net of cash acquired and in the fourth quarter of 2013 we acquired netideas and enigma information systems ltd for an aggregate of 250 million  net of cash acquired 

our expenditures for property and equipment consist primarily of computer equipment software office equipment and facility improvements 

cash provided used by financing activities 

  



in both the second and fourth quarters of 2014 we refinanced our credit facility as described in credit facility  below we incurred 79 million  and 19 million  of origination costs in 2014 and 2012 respectively in connection with entering into and amending the new and previous credit facilities in 2014 we borrowed 280 million to finance acquisitions and 125 million to repurchase shares under an accelerated share repurchase transaction in 2012 we borrowed 230 million to finance our acquisition of servigistics proceeds from issuance of common stock reflects stock option exercises stock option exercises totaled 01 million shares in 2014 05 million shares in 2013 and 23 million shares in 2012 as of september 30 2014 stock options outstanding had gross exercise prices totaling approximately 01 million accordingly assuming no additional stock options are granted future proceeds from option exercises will be immaterial 

share repurchase authorization 

our articles of organization authorize us to issue up to 500 million  shares of our common stock our board of directors has periodically authorized the repurchase of shares of our common stock we were authorized to repurchase up to 100 million  worth of shares with cash from operations for each of our fiscal years 2014 2013 and 2012 additionally on august 4 2014 our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to an additional 600 million  of our common stock through september 30 2017 we intend to use cash from operations and borrowings under our credit facility to make such repurchases pursuant to this repurchase authorization in the fourth quarter we entered into the 125 million  accelerated share repurchase agreement described below we repurchased 51 million  shares at a cost of 2249 million  in 2014 including 375 million held by the bank pending final settlement of the asr described below 31 million  shares at a cost of 749 million  in 2013 and 16 million  shares at a cost of 350 million  in 2012 all shares of our common stock repurchased are automatically restored to the status of authorized and unissued 

on august 14 2014 we entered into an accelerated share repurchase “asr” agreement with a major financial institution “bank” the asr allows us to buy a large number of shares immediately at a purchase price determined by an average market price over a period of time under the asr we agreed to purchase 1250 million  of our common stock in total with an initial delivery of 2300210  shares “initial shares” of our common stock to us by the bank the initial shares represent the number of shares at the current market price equal to 70 of the total fixed purchase price of 1250 million  the repurchased shares were retired and returned to an unissued status the remainder of the total purchase price of 375 million  reflects the value of the stock held by the bank pending final settlement and accordingly was recorded as a reduction to additional paidin capital final settlement of the asr will occur no later than february 17 2015 at the bank’s discretion upon settlement of the asr the total shares repurchased by us will be determined based on a share price equal to the daily volume weightedaverage price “vwap” of our common stock during the term of the asr program less a fixed per share discount amount at settlement the bank will deliver additional shares to us in the event total shares are greater than the 2300210  shares initially delivered and we will issue additional shares or cash to the bank at our option in the event total shares are less than the shares initially delivered as of september 30 2014 based on the vwap of our common stock for the period august 14 2014 through september 30 2014 settlement of the asr would have resulted in 982419  additional shares delivered by the bank to us 

credit facility 

in september 2014 we entered into a multicurrency credit facility with a syndicate of sixteen banks for which jpmorgan chase bank na acts as administrative agent the credit facility replaced a credit facility with the same banks entered into in january 2014 we expect to use the credit facility for general corporate purposes including acquisitions of businesses share repurchases and working capital requirements as of september 30 2014 the fair value of our credit facility approximates our book value 

the credit facility consists of a 500 million  term loan and a 1 billion  revolving loan commitment and may be increased by an additional 250 million  in the form of revolving loans or term loans or a combination thereof if the existing or additional lenders are willing to make such increased commitments the revolving loan commitment does not require amortization of principal the term loan requires prepayment of principal at the end of each calendar quarter the revolving loan and term loan may be repaid in whole or in part prior to the scheduled maturity dates at our option without penalty or premium the credit facility matures on september 15 2019 when all remaining amounts outstanding will be due and payable in full we are required to make principal payments under the term loan of 25 million  50 million  50 million  75 million  and 300 million  in 2015 2016 2017 2018 and 2019 respectively 

ptc is the sole borrower under the credit facility the obligations under the credit facility are guaranteed by ptc’s material domestic subsidiaries and 65  of the voting equity interests of ptc’s material firsttier foreign subsidiaries are pledged as collateral for the obligations 

  as of september 30 2014  we had 6119 million  outstanding under the credit facility comprised of the 500 million  term loan and a 1119 million  revolving loan 

the credit facility limits ptc’s and its subsidiaries’ ability to among other things incur additional indebtedness incur liens or guarantee obligations pay dividends other than to ptc and make other distributions make investments and enter into joint ventures dispose of assets and engage in transactions with affiliates except on an armslength basis under the credit facility ptc and its material domestic subsidiaries may not invest cash or property in or loan to ptc’s foreign subsidiaries in aggregate amounts exceeding 75 million  for any purpose and an additional 150 million  for acquisitions of businesses in addition under the credit facility ptc and its subsidiaries must maintain the following financial ratios 

 as of september 30 2014  our leverage ratio was 182  to 100  our fixed charge coverage ratio was 1770  to 100  and we were in compliance with all financial and operating covenants of the credit facility as of september 30 2014 we had approximately 408 million available to borrow under the credit facility within our covenant limits on november 17 2014 we borrowed an additional 35 million  under our credit facility for shortterm cash requirements including the payment of fiscal 2014 incentive compensation 

any failure to comply with the financial or operating covenants of the credit facility would prevent ptc from being able to borrow additional funds and would constitute a default permitting the lenders to among other things accelerate the amounts outstanding including all accrued interest and unpaid fees under the credit facility and to terminate the credit facility a change in control of ptc as defined in the agreement also constitutes an event of default permitting the lenders to accelerate the indebtedness and terminate the credit facility 

  

for a description of additional terms and conditions of the credit facility including limitations on our ability to undertake certain actions see note h debt in “notes to consolidated financial statements” in this annual report 

expectations for fiscal 2015 

we believe that existing cash and cash equivalents together with cash generated from operations and amounts available under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements through at least the next twelve months and to meet our known longterm capital requirements in 2015 we expect to repurchase 125 million of our stock and repay 100 million of borrowings under our credit facility 

we evaluate possible strategic transactions on an ongoing basis and at any given time may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to possible strategic transactions our expected uses of cash could change our cash position could be reduced and we may incur additional debt obligations to the extent we complete additional acquisitions 

as described in note m pension plans in notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report we have begun the process of terminating our us pension plan we expect to contribute an additional 25 million to the plan in 2015 to complete the termination additionally we expect to make voluntary contributions to a nonus plan of 20 million in 2015 10 million of which was contributed in october 2014 

at september 30 2014  we had cash and cash equivalents of 729 million in the united states 760 million in europe 991 million in the pacific rim including india 212 million in japan and 244 million in other nonus countries as of september 30 2014  we had an outstanding intercompany loan receivable of 296 million this amount can be repaid with cash generated by our foreign subsidiaries and repatriated to the us without future tax cost additionally we are evaluating several feasible strategies that can be employed to repatriate foreign earnings at minimal tax cost 

contractual obligations 

at september 30 2014 our contractual obligations were as follows 

  



  

 as of september 30 2014 we had letters of credit and bank guarantees outstanding of approximately 36 million  of which 09 million  was collateralized primarily related to our corporate headquarters lease in needham massachusetts 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have not created and are not party to any specialpurpose or offbalance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital incurring debt or operating parts of our business that are not consolidated to the extent of our ownership interest therein into our financial statements we have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby we have subordinated retained interests derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks contingent liabilities or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing liquidity market risk or credit risk support to us 

recent accounting pronouncements 

revenue recognition 

in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 asu 201409 to supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under us gaap the core principle of asu 201409 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services asu 201409 defines a five step process to achieve this core principle and in doing so it is possible more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than required under existing us gaap including identifying performance obligations in the contract estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation asu 201409 is effective for us in our first quarter of fiscal 2018 using either of two methods i retrospective to each prior reporting period presented with the option to elect certain practical expedients as defined within asu 201409 or ii retrospective with the cumulative effect of

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we face exposure to financial market risks including adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 

foreign currency exchange risk 

our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to western european countries japan china and canada we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates that arise from receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies we do not enter into or hold foreign currency derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes nor do we enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge future cash flow or forecast transactions 

our nonus revenues generally are transacted through our nonus subsidiaries and typically are denominated in their local currency in addition expenses that are incurred by our nonus subsidiaries typically are denominated in their local currency in 2014 2013 and 2012 approximately twothirds of our revenue and half of our expenses were transacted in currencies other than the us dollar currency translation affects our reported results because we report our results of operations in us dollars historically our most significant currency risk has been changes in the euro and japanese yen relative to the us dollar based on 2014 revenue and expense levels excluding restructuring charges a 010 change in the usd to european exchange rates and a 10 yen change in the yen to usd exchange rate would impact operating income by approximately 12 million and 7 million respectively 

our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations arises in part from intercompany transactions with most intercompany transactions occurring between a us dollar functional currency entity and a foreign currency denominated entity intercompany transactions typically are denominated in the local currency of the nonus dollar functional currency subsidiary in order to centralize foreign currency risk also both ptc the parent company and our nonus subsidiaries may transact business with our customers and vendors in a currency other than their functional currency transaction risk in addition we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results and balances of our nonus subsidiaries are translated into us dollars translation risk if sales to customers outside of the united states increase our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will increase 

our foreign currency risk management strategy is principally designed to mitigate the future potential financial impact of changes in the us dollar value of balances denominated in foreign currency resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates our foreign currency hedging program uses forward contracts to manage the foreign currency exposures that exist as part of our ongoing business operations the contracts primarily are denominated in canadian dollars and european currencies and have maturities of less than three months 

generally we do not designate foreign currency forward contracts as hedges for accounting purposes and changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized immediately in earnings because we enter into forward contracts only as an economic hedge any gain or loss on the underlying foreigndenominated balance would be offset by the loss or gain on the forward contract gains and losses on forward contracts and foreign denominated receivables and payables are included in foreign currency net losses 

as of september 30 2014  and 2013  we had outstanding forward contracts with notional amounts equivalent to the following 

  



debt 

 as of september 30 2014  we had 6119 million  outstanding under our variablerate credit facility comprised of a 500 million  term loan and a 1119 million  revolving loan loans under the credit facility bear interest at variable rates which reset every 30  to 180  days depending on the rate and period selected by the company these loans are subject to interest rate risk as interest rates will be adjusted at each rollover date to the extent such amounts are not repaid as of september 30 2014  the annual rates on the term and revolving loan loans were 1625  both of which will reset on december 17 2014 if there was a hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates the annual net impact to earnings and cash flows would be 61 million this hypothetical change in cash flows and earnings has been calculated based on the borrowings outstanding at september 30 2014 and a 100 basis point per annum change in interest rate applied over a oneyear period 

cash and cash equivalents 

as of september 30 2014 cash equivalents were invested in highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased we invest our cash with highly rated financial institutions in north america europe and asiapacific and in diversified domestic and international money market mutual funds at september 30 2014  we had cash and cash equivalents of 729 million in the united states 760 million in europe 991 million in the pacific rim including india 212 million in japan and 244 million in other nonus countries given the short maturities and investment grade quality of the portfolio holdings at september 30 2014 a hypothetical 10 change in interest rates would not materially affect the fair value of our cash and cash equivalents 

our invested cash is subject to interest rate fluctuations and for nonus operations foreign currency risk in a declining interest rate environment we would experience a decrease in interest income the opposite holds true in a rising interest rate environment over the past several years the us federal reserve board european central bank and bank of england have changed certain benchmark interest rates which have led to declines and increases in market interest rates these changes in market interest rates have resulted in fluctuations in interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents interest income will continue to fluctuate based on changes in market interest rates and levels of cash available for investment our consolidated cash balances were impacted unfavorably by 94 million  and 13 million in 2014 and 2013 respectively and favorably by 07 million in 2012 due to changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar particularly the euro and the japanese yen

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend the following are important factors we have identified that could affect our future results you should consider them carefully when evaluating forwardlooking statements made by us including those contained in this annual report because these factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in forwardlooking statements the risks described below are not the only risks we face additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business financial condition andor operating results 

i operational considerations 

our operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter making future operating results difficult to predict 

our quarterly operating results historically have fluctuated and are likely to continue to fluctuate depending on a number of factors including 

 accordingly our quarterly results are difficult to predict prior to the end of the quarter and we may be unable to confirm or adjust expectations with respect to our operating results for a particular quarter until that quarter has closed any failure to meet our quarterly revenue or earnings targets could adversely impact the market price of our stock 

our long range financial targets are predicated on revenue growth and operating margin improvements that we may fail to achieve which could reduce our expected earnings and cause us to fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors and cause our stock price to decline 

we are projecting revenue growth and operating margin improvements in our long range plan through 2017 our revenue projections include our expectations regarding revenue growth from sales of our cad extended plm and slm products and acquired products we expect revenue growth from our extended plm and slm products will exceed revenue growth from our cad products which comprised 40 of our revenue in 2013 and the market for which is mature we may not achieve planned revenue growth if the markets we serve do not grow at expected rates if we are not able to deliver solutions desired by customers and potential customers andor if acquired businesses do not generate the revenue growth that we expect 

we are projecting operating margin improvements predicated on service margin improvements operating leverage as revenue increases and improved operating efficiencies particularly within our sales organization services margins are significantly lower than license and support margins future projected improvements in our operating margin as a percent of revenue are based in part on our ability to improve services margins by reducing the amount of direct services that we perform through expansion of our service partner program and improving the profitability of services that we perform if our services revenue increases as a percentage of total revenue andor if we are unable to improve our services margins our overall operating margin may not increase to the levels we expect or may decrease additionally if we do not achieve lower sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue through productivity initiatives we may not achieve our operating margin targets if operating margins do not improve our earnings could be adversely affected and our stock price could decline 

 economic weakness in the united states and globally may adversely affect our business  

the past five years have been characterized by weak global economic conditions tight credit markets reduced liquidity and extreme volatility in many financial markets we experienced a significant decline in revenue in 2009 in all geographic regions in which we operate as customers reduced or deferred purchases of our products and services although revenue increased year over year in each of 2010 2011 2012 and 2013 some of which was attributable to acquisitions the economic environment remains uncertain if the economic environment does not improve or deteriorates our business may be unfavorably impacted 

we depend on sales within the discrete manufacturing sector and our revenue has in recent quarters been and is likely to continue to be adversely affected if manufacturing activity continues to slow 

a large amount of our revenue is related to sales to customers in the discrete manufacturing sector we have seen a decline in manufacturing activity and corresponding decreases in spending by customers which has adversely affected our revenue and may continue to do so until conditions improve 

a significant portion of our revenue is generated from support contracts decreases in support renewal rates or a decrease in the number of new licenses we sell would negatively impact our future support revenue and operating results 

a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from support contracts these contracts are generally renewed on an annual basis and typically have a high rate of customer renewal in addition to the recurring revenue base associated with these contracts a majority of customers purchasing new perpetual licenses also purchase related annual support contracts if the rate of renewal for these contracts or the sale of new licenses decreases our support revenue growth and profitability will be adversely affected 

we face significant competition which may reduce our profits and limit or reduce our market share 

the market for product development solutions is rapidly changing and very competitive and there has been a trend in industry consolidation among technology companies this competition could result in price reductions for our products and services reduced margins loss of customers and loss of market share our primary competition comes from 

 we must continually modify and enhance our products to keep pace with changing technology and to address our customers’ needs and expectations and any failure to do so could reduce demand for our products 

our ability to remain competitive will depend on our ability to enhance our current offerings and develop new products and services that keep pace with technological developments and meet evolving customer requirements in addition our solutions must meet customer expectations to be successful if our solutions fail to meet customer expectations customers may discontinue adoption of our solutions resulting in a loss of potential additional sales and we may be unable to retain existing customers or attract new customers 

our financial condition could be adversely affected if significant errors or defects are found in our software 

sophisticated software can sometimes contain errors defects or other performance problems if errors or defects are discovered in our current or future products we may need to expend significant financial technical and management resources or divert some of our development resources in order to resolve or work around those defects and we may not be able to correct them in a timely manner or provide an adequate response to our customers 

errors defects or other performance problems in our products could cause us to delay new product releases or customer deployments any such delays could cause delays in our ability to realize revenue from the licensing and shipment of new or enhanced products and give our competitors a greater opportunity to market competing products such difficulties could also cause us to lose customers technical problems or the loss of customers could also damage our business reputation and cause us to lose new business opportunities 

a breach of security in our products or computer systems may compromise the integrity of our products harm our reputation create additional liability and adversely impact our financial results 

we make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our products source code and computer systems the risk of a security breach or disruption particularly through cyber attack or cyber intrusion including by computer hackers foreign governments and cyber terrorists has increased as the number intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased if the security and integrity of our products or systems are breached our products could cease to function properly sensitive proprietary or confidential information of our customers or ours could be accessed without authorization and other destructive outcomes could occur if any of these events were to occur our reputation could be harmed customers could stop buying our products we could face lawsuits and potential liability and our financial results could be negatively impacted 

businesses we acquire may not generate the revenue and earnings we anticipated and may otherwise adversely affect our business 

we have acquired and intend to continue to acquire new businesses and technologies if we fail to successfully integrate and manage the businesses and technologies we acquire or if an acquisition does not further our business strategy as we expected our operating results may be adversely affected 

moreover business combinations also involve a number of risks and uncertainties that can adversely affect our operations and operating results including 

 we are dependent on key personnel whose loss could impair our operations our product development or our sales efforts 

our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical and sales personnel 

we require highly skilled technical personnel to develop our products competition for such personnel in our industry is intense if we are unable to attract and retain technical personnel with the requisite skills our product development efforts could be delayed which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

our sales efforts rely on having a sufficient number of sales representatives and sales support personnel with the skills and knowledge necessary to sell our products including an ability to educate our customers about our products in order to create and meet demand for our products if we are unable to attract or retain sales and sales support personnel with the requisite expertise our revenue could be adversely affected 

our sales and operations are globally dispersed which exposes us to additional operating and compliance risks 

we sell and deliver software and services and maintain support operations in a large number of countries whose laws and practices differ from one another the americas accounted for 40 europe for 37 and asiapacific for 23 of our revenue in 2013 managing these geographically dispersed operations requires significant attention and resources to ensure compliance with laws accordingly while we strive to maintain a comprehensive compliance program we cannot guarantee that an employee agent or business partner will not act in violation of our policies or us or other applicable laws such violations can lead to civil andor criminal prosecutions substantial fines and the revocation of our rights to continue certain operations and also cause business and reputation loss for example as discussed in risk factors ii other considerations we have been investigating certain matters in china which matters and related remedial actions could have an adverse effect on our business and our results we are currently cooperating to provide information to the sec and department of justice in connection with an investigation concerning certain payments and expenses by certain business partners and employees in china that raise questions of compliance with laws including the us foreign corrupt practices act andor compliance with our business policies 

at times we provide extended payment terms to our customers which may be a factor in our customers’ purchasing decisions and our revenues could be adversely affected if we ceased making these terms available 

we have provided extended payment terms to certain customers in connection with transactions we have completed with them providing extended payment terms may positively influence our customers’ purchasing decisions but may reduce our cash flows in the shortterm if we reduce the amount of extended payment terms we provide to customers customers might reduce or defer the amount they spend on our products from the amount they might otherwise have spent if extended payment terms were available to them if this were to occur our revenue or revenue growth could be lower than in prior periods andor lower than we expect 

we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights 

our software products and trademarks including our company names product names and logos are proprietary we protect our intellectual property rights in these items by relying on copyrights trademarks patents and common law 

safeguards including trade secret protection as well as restrictions on disclosures and transferability contained in our agreements with other parties despite these measures the laws of all relevant jurisdictions may not afford adequate protection to our products and other intellectual property in addition we frequently encounter attempts by individuals and companies to pirate our software if our measures to protect our intellectual property rights fail others may be able to use those rights which could reduce our competitiveness and revenues 

intellectual property infringement claims could be asserted against us which could be expensive to defend and could result in limitations on our use of the claimed intellectual property 

the software industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding copyright patent and other intellectual property rights if a lawsuit of this type is filed it could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel we cannot be sure that we would prevail against any such asserted claims if we did not prevail we could be prevented from using the claimed intellectual property or required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements which might not be available on terms acceptable to us in addition to possible claims with respect to our proprietary products some of our products contain technology developed by and licensed from third parties and we may likewise be susceptible to infringement claims with respect to these thirdparty technologies 

our current research and development efforts may not generate revenue for several years if at all 

developing and localizing software products is expensive and the investment in product development often involves a long return on investment cycle we have made and expect to continue to make significant investments in research and development and related product opportunities that could adversely affect our operating results if not offset by revenue increases we believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position 

we may have exposure to additional tax liabilities and our effective tax rate may increase or fluctuate which could increase our income tax expense and reduce our net income 

as a multinational organization we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes in the us and in various foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision and other tax liabilities in the ordinary course of a global business there are many intercompany transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain our tax returns are subject to review by various taxing authorities although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes could be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 

our effective tax rate can be adversely affected by several factors many of which are outside of our control including 

 because we have substantial cash requirements in the united states and a significant portion of our cash is generated and held outside of the united states if our cash available in the united states and the cash available under our credit facility is insufficient to meet our operating expenses and debt repayment obligations in the united states we may be required to raise cash in ways that could negatively affect our financial condition results of operations and the market price of our common stock 

we have significant operations outside the united states as of september 30 2013 approximately 85 of our cash and cash equivalents balance was held by subsidiaries outside the united states with the remainder of the balance held by the us parent or its subsidiaries in the united states we believe that the combination of our existing united states cash and cash equivalents proceeds from repayment of an intercompany loan owed to the united states from a foreign subsidiary future united states operating cash flows and cash available under our credit facility are sufficient to meet our ongoing united states operating expenses and debt repayment obligations however if these sources of cash are insufficient to meet our future financial obligations in the united states we will be required to seek other available funding sources or means to repatriate cash to the united states which could negatively impact our results of operations financial position and the market price of our common stock 

our sales to government clients subject us to risks of funding approvals 

we derive revenues from contracts with the us government state and local governments and their respective agencies there is increased pressure for governments and their agencies to reduce spending many of our federal government contracts contain fiscal funding clauses whereby ongoing funding of the contracts is subject to approval of appropriations by the us congress similarly our contracts at the state and local levels are subject to government funding authorizations if additional funding for these contracts is not approved it could reduce revenue we have recognized and reduce future revenue from such contracts 

ii other considerations 

we have been investigating certain matters in china which matters and related remedial actions could have an adverse effect on our business and our results 

we have been cooperating to provide information to the us securities and exchange commission and the department of justice concerning payments and expenses by certain of our business partners in china andor by employees of our chinese subsidiary that raise questions concerning compliance with laws including the us foreign corrupt practices act although we have begun discussions with the sec and department of justice regarding possible resolution of this matter we continue to respond to requests for additional information and cannot predict when or how this matter will be resolved resolution of this matter could include fines and penalties which could significantly impact our cash balances any settlement or other resolution of this matter could have collateral effects on our business in china the united states and elsewhere and could subject us to shareholder suits moreover because we are unable to estimate an amount that could be associated with any resolution we have not recorded a liability for this matter if we are required to record a liability for this matter this could materially impact our results for the period in which the liability is recorded 

we terminated certain employees and business partners in china in connection with this matter which may have an adverse impact on our level of sales in china until replacements for those employees and business partners are in place and productive revenue from china has historically represented 6 to 7 of our total revenue 

we are required to comply with certain financial and operating covenants under our credit facility and to make scheduled debt payments as they become due any failure to comply with those covenants or to make scheduled payments could cause amounts borrowed under the facility to become immediately due and payable or prevent us from borrowing under the facility 

our credit facility which consists of a 150 million term loan and a 300 million revolving loan with an accordion feature that allows us to borrow up to an additional 150 million if the existing or additional lenders agree matures on august 16 2017 at which time any amounts outstanding will be due and payable in full as of september 30 2013 we had 258 million outstanding under the credit facility primarily related to our acquisition of servigistics in october 2012 we may wish to borrow additional amounts under the facility in the future to support our operations including for strategic acquisitions 

we are required to comply with specified financial and operating covenants and to make scheduled repayments of our term loan which limit our ability to operate our business as we otherwise might operate it our failure to comply with any of these covenants or to meet any payment obligations under the facility could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived would result in any amounts outstanding including any accrued interest and unpaid fees becoming immediately due and payable we might not have sufficient working capital or liquidity to satisfy any repayment obligations in the event of an acceleration of those obligations in addition if we are not in compliance with the financial and operating covenants at the time we wish to borrow funds we will be unable to borrow funds 

our stock price has been volatile which may make it harder to resell your shares at a time and at a price that is favorable to you 

market prices for securities of software companies are generally volatile and are subject to significant fluctuations unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies the trading prices and valuations of these stocks and of ours may not be predictable negative changes in the public’s perception of the prospects of software companies or of ptc or the markets we serve could depress our stock price regardless of our operating results 

also a large percentage of our common stock is held by institutional investors purchases and sales of our common stock by these institutional investors could have a significant impact on the market price of the stock for more information about those investors please see our proxy statement with respect to our most recent annual meeting of stockholders and schedules 13d and 13g filed with the sec with respect to our common stock

unless otherwise indicated all references to a year reflect our fiscal year that ends on september 30 

executive overview 

we achieved our nongaap operating margin and nongaap earnings per share targets for 2013 in the face of a challenging macroeconomic environment cost containment measures and restructuring actions completed during the year enabled us to achieve these results despite lower than expected revenue nongaap operating margin grew 16 247 basis points to 221 in 2013 from 196 in 2012 and nongaap earnings per share increased 20 to 181 in 2013 from 151 in 2012 

we delivered gaap earnings per share of 119 for 2013 up from a loss of 030 in 2012 and gaap operating margin of 98 in 2013 compared with 102 in 2012 our gaap results reflect higher restructuring charges in 2013 compared to 2012 by 27 million the recording of a valuation allowance against us net deferred tax assets in 2012 resulting in a noncash income tax charge of 124 million the reversal of a portion of the valuation allowance in 2013 37 million as a result of accounting for acquisitions in 2013 and an 8 million tax benefit associated with accounting for our us pension plan the restructuring charges and tax items were excluded from our nongaap measures as well as the other items described in our reconciliation of nongaap measures to gaap results under results of operations  nongaap measures  below 

for 2013 total revenue was up 3 year over year up 4 on a constant currency basis to 1294 million 1297 million on a nongaap basis on an organic basis excluding revenue from businesses acquired in 2013 95 million total revenue was down 5 year over year down 3 on a constant currency basis total license revenue for 2013 was 344 million a decrease of 1 year over year up 1 on a constant currency basis on an organic basis excluding license revenue from businesses acquired of 27 million total license revenue was down 9 year over year down 7 on a constant currency basis both total revenue and license revenue were unfavorably impacted by the slowdown in the global manufacturing industry particularly in europe and the americas and unfavorable currency movements particularly in the japanese yen from a geographic perspective while organic license revenue in the americas and europe in 2013 was soft reflecting ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty we saw somewhat of a rebound in europe and the pacific rim in the fourth quarter of 2013 and solid growth in japan in 2013 which was positively impacted by higher large deal revenue partially offset by unfavorable currency movements our service revenue was down year over year on both a reported and organic basis due to lower license sales in recent periods driving less overall demand for services and in part due to expansion of our service partner program under which certain service opportunities are referred to partners 

we ended 2013 with 242 million of cash down from 490 million at the end 2012 reflecting in part our acquisitions of servigistics enigma and netideas for a total of 246 million 112 million used to repay a portion of the balance outstanding under our credit facility and 75 million used for stock repurchases partially offset by 225 million of cash generated from operations as of september 30 2013 we had 184 million available under the revolving loan portion of our credit facility 

nongaap measures are reconciled to gaap results under results of operations  nongaap measures  below 

future expectations strategies and risks 

the slowdown in the global manufacturing industry uncertainty about the nearterm economic environment and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates were headwinds for revenue growth in fiscal 2013 while we have seen some 

indications of improvements in global manufacturing economic conditions there is still a significant level of uncertainty in terms of the level and speed at which growth will resume we expect modest revenue growth in 2014 and we expect an increase in nongaap operating margin to 25 driven by 1 continued vigilance on cost controls and cost savings from restructuring actions 2 increased sales productivity and 3 improvement in services nongaap net margin to approximately 15 for 2014 our goal is to achieve yearoveryear revenue growth of 2 to 3 this revenue goal includes license revenue growth of 2 to 6 support revenue growth of approximately 3 and service revenue growth of approximately 2 our 2014 earnings goals are to achieve nongaap operating margin expansion of 300 basis points from 22 in 2013 to approximately 25 in 2014 expansion of gaap operating margins from 10 in 2013 to approximately 17 in 2014 and nongaap earnings per share of 200 to 210 gaap earnings per share of 129 to 137 if economic conditions do not improve or deteriorate further or if foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar differ significantly from our current assumed rates our results could differ materially from our targets our targets assume rates of 135 usd to one euro and 98 yen to one usd 

also our results have been impacted and we expect will continue to be impacted by our ability to close large transactions the amount of revenue particularly license revenue attributable to large transactions and the number of such transactions may vary significantly from quarter to quarter based on customer purchasing decisions and macroeconomic conditions our growth rates have become increasingly dependent on adoption of our solutions by large direct customers such transactions tend to be larger in size and may have long lead times as they often follow a lengthy product selection and evaluation process this may cause volatility in our results 

impact of an investigation in china   

we have been cooperating to provide information to the us securities and exchange commission and the department of justice concerning payments and expenses by certain of our business partners in china andor by employees of our chinese subsidiary that raise questions concerning compliance with laws including the us foreign corrupt practices act although we have begun discussions with the sec and department of justice regarding possible resolution of this matter we continue to respond to requests for information and cannot predict when or how this matter may be resolved resolution of this matter could include fines and penalties however we are unable to estimate an amount that could be associated with any resolution and accordingly we have not recorded a liability for this matter if we are required to record a liability for this matter or to pay fines or penalties associated with this matter this could materially impact our results for the period in which the liability is recorded or such amounts are paid further any settlement or other resolution of this matter could have collateral effects on our business in china the united states and elsewhere 

  

we terminated certain employees and business partners in china in connection with this matter which may have an adverse impact on our level of sales in china until replacements for those employees and business partners are in place and productive revenue from china has historically represented 6 to 7 of our total revenue 

revenue operating margin earnings per share and cash flow 

the following table shows the financial measures that we consider the most significant indicators of the performance of our business in addition to providing operating income operating margin and diluted earnings per share as calculated under generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” it shows nongaap operating income operating margin and diluted earnings per share for the reported periods these nongaap measures exclude fair value adjustments related to acquired deferred support revenue stockbased compensation expense amortization of acquired intangible assets expense acquisitionrelated charges and gains restructuring charges certain identified gains or charges included in nonoperating other income expense and the related tax effects of the preceding items as well as the tax items identified excluding those expenses and items provides investors another view of our operating results that is aligned with management budgets and with performance criteria in our incentive compensation plans management uses and investors should use nongaap measures in conjunction with our gaap results we discuss the nongaap measures in detail under nongaap measures  below 

  



  

 

results of operations 

acquisitions 

in 2013 we completed the acquisitions of servigistics enigma and netideas in 2011 we completed the acquisitions of mks and 4cs the results of operations of these acquired businesses have been included in our consolidated financial statements beginning on their respective acquisition dates servigistics enigma and netideas added 949 million  979 million on a nongaap basis to our 2013 revenue substantially all of which is included in slm revenue mks and 4cs added 815 million  840 million on a nongaap basis and 268 million  294 million on a nongaap basis to our 2012 and 2011 revenue respectively substantially all of which is included in extended plm revenue 

impact of foreign currency exchange on results of operations 

approximately two thirds of our revenue and half of our expenses are transacted in currencies other than the us dollar currency translation affects our reported results because we report our results of operations in us dollars changes in currency exchange rates in 2013 and 2012 compared to 2012 and 2011 particularly for the yen and the euro reduced both revenue and expenses conversely in 2011 our revenue and expenses increased as a result of changes in currency rates if actual reported results were converted into us dollars based on the corresponding prior year’s foreign currency exchange rates 2013 and 2012 revenue would have been higher by 182 million and 252 million respectively expenses would have been higher by 88 million and 192 million respectively and 2011 revenue would have been lower by 368 million and 2011 expenses would have been lower by 210 million the net impact on yearoveryear results would have been an increase in operating income of 94 million and 60 million in 2013 and 2012 respectively and a decrease in operating income of 158 million in 2011 the results of operations revenue by line of business and revenue by geographic region in the tables that follow present both actual percentage changes year over year and percentage changes on a constant currency basis 

revenue 

we report our revenue by line of business license service and support by solution area cad extended plm and slm and by geographic region americas europe pacific rim and japan 

results include combined revenue from direct sales and our channel 

revenue by line of business 





license revenue 

the amount of license revenue attributable to large transactions and the number of such transactions may vary significantly from period to period and by geographic region we had three transactions with license revenue in excess of 5 million in 2013 two in japan and one in the americas four in 2012 two in the americas and two in europe and five in 2011 three in the americas one in europe and one in japan 

2013 compared to 2012 

the decline in license revenue in 2013 reflects yearoveryear declines of 2 in the americas and 12 in europe these declines were partially offset by growth in japan of 32 58 on a constant currency basis and an increase in the pacific rim of 3 results reflect continued softness in europe reflecting lower license revenue from large license transactions particularly sales of extended plm products which we attribute to macroeconomic conditions in that region additionally macroeconomic conditions remain uncertain in the americas which we believe has continued to impact results with growth slowing in the fourth quarter when compared to a strong fourth quarter of 2012 however we are optimistic about the longterm outlook in both europe where we had solid growth in license revenue in the fourth quarter of 2013 compared to the fourth quarter of 2012 and the americas and expect modest growth in 2014 relative to 2013 provided we begin to see further economic recovery in 2014 

organic license revenue in 2013 was down 9 on a yearoveryear basis license revenue from businesses acquired in 2013 which was the primary contributor to growth in slm license revenue in 2013 was 268 million 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates unfavorably impacted license revenue by 61 million in 2013 compared to 2012 

2012 compared to 2011 

license revenue of 3484 million in 2012 increased 63 million from 2011 primarily due to a 158 million increase in license revenue from our mks and 4cs businesses acquired in the second half of 2011 262 million in 2012 compared to 104 million in 2011 partially offset by unfavorable currency movements from a geographic standpoint license revenue increases in the pacific rim of 22 140 million and japan of 5 14 million were partially offset by a decrease in europe of 7 84 million americas license revenue was flat in 2012 compared to 2011 

  

extended plm license revenue while negatively impacted by our performance in europe grew in 2012 compared to 2011 due to the increased license revenue contribution from mks and 4cs and sales of ptc windchill which were 19 183 million higher cad license revenue declined in 2012 compared to 2011 due to a decline in ptc creo license sales which comprise almost all of cad license revenue in 2012 after a strong year in 2011 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates unfavorably impacted license revenue by 65 million in 2012 compared to 2011 

service revenue 

consulting and training services engagements typically result from sales of new licenses particularly of our extended plm and slm solutions year over year service revenue for 2013 was down overall and on an organic basis organic service revenue was down 13 377 million service revenue from businesses acquired in 2013 was 370 million which was the primary contributor to growth in slm service revenue in 2013 year over year our organic consulting service revenue which primarily supports ptc windchill implementations was down 14 from 2013 to 2012 year over year our organic training business which typically represents about 15 of our total service revenue was down 6 we attribute the declines in organic total service revenue and consulting service revenue to lower license revenue in recent quarters and to success we are having in expanding our service partner program our service partner program under which service engagements are referred to third party service providers is part of our overall margin expansion strategy as our service partners increase their delivery capabilities and perform additional service engagements we expect service revenue to decline as a percentage of total revenue which we expect will contribute to overall operating margin improvements as service revenue has lower margins than license and support revenue 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates unfavorably impacted service revenue by 27 million in 2013 compared to 2012 

2012 compared to 2011 

increased extended plm license sales in 2012 had a favorable impact on service revenue in 2012 compared to 2011 consulting revenue was up 11 249 million and training revenue was up 9 33 million mks and 4cs contributed 181 million to service revenue in 2012 and 63 million in 2011 excluding mks and 4cs service revenue increased 6 164 million in 2012 as compared to 2011 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates unfavorably impacted service revenue by 68 million in 2012 compared to 2011 

support revenue 

support revenue is comprised of contracts to maintain new andor previously purchased software we saw steady growth in support revenue in 2012 and 2013 with total seats under maintenance up 13 year over year in both periods cad and extended plm support seats increased 2 and 12 respectively as of the end of 2013 compared to the end of 2012 organic support revenue increased 2 116 million in 2013 compared to 2012 support revenue from businesses acquired in 2013 was 311 millionwhich was the primary contributor to growth in slm support revenue in 2013 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates unfavorably impacted support revenue by 94 million in 2013 compared to 2012 

2012 compared to 2011 

mks and 4cs contributed 372 million to support revenue in 2012 and 102 million in 2011 which was the primary contributor to the growth in extended plm support revenue in 2012 excluding mks and 4cs support revenue increased 5 272 million in 2012 as compared to 2011 cad and extended plm seats under support increased 3 and 15 respectively as of the end of 2012 compared to the end of 2011 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates unfavorably impacted support revenue by 118 million in 2012 compared to 2011 

revenue from individual customers 

we enter into customer contracts that may result in revenue being recognized over multiple reporting periods accordingly revenue recognized in a current period may be attributable to contracts entered into during the current period or in prior periods license andor service revenue of 1 million or more recognized from individual customers in a single quarter 

during the fiscal year from contracts entered into during that quarter andor a prior quarter is shown in the table below the amount of revenue particularly license revenue attributable to such large transactions and the number of such transactions may vary significantly from quarter to quarter based on customer purchasing decisions the completion of large services engagements commenced in previous quarters and macroeconomic conditions 

revenue from large transactions in 2013 compared to 2012was higher in japan and the pacific rim and lower in the americas and europe we believe that the results in the americas and europe reflect unfavorable economic conditions in those regions revenue from large customers in 2012 compared to 2011 reflects growth in consulting projects a slight decline in extended plm license revenue and a decline in cad license revenue resulting in a lower overall mix of license revenue the license revenue portion of this metric was 48 in 2013 compared to 44 in 2012 and 52 in 2011 the 2012 decline in license revenue as a percentage of the total is due to a particularly strong comparison period in 2011 due in part to our launch of ptc creo in 2011

gross margin as a percentage of total revenue in 2013 compared to the yearago periods reflects higher service margins partially offset by lower license margins primarily attributable to lower license revenue and higher amortization of acquired purchased software license revenue which generates the highest gross margins was 27 of total revenue in 2013 compared to 28 in 2012 and 29 in 2011 service margins in 2013 and 2012 have been improving due in part to reducing the amount of direct services that we perform through expansion of our service partner program service revenue comprised 23 of our total revenue in 2013 2012 and 2011 

costs and expenses 

  





  

 

2013 compared to 2012 

costs and expenses in 2013 compared to 2012 increased primarily as a result of the following 

 19 

 these cost increases were partially offset by cost savings associated with restructuring actions in 2012 and 2013 described directly above and below and the impact of foreign currency movements which favorably impacted costs and expenses by 88 million in 2013 

2012 compared to 2011 

costs and expenses in 2012 compared to 2011 increased primarily as a result of the following 

 these cost increases were partially offset by cost savings associated with restructuring actions in 2012 the impact of foreign currency movements which favorably impacted costs and expenses by 192 million and lower acquisitionrelated costs included in general and administrative which were 38 million in 2012 compared to 78 million in 2011 

cost of license revenue 

  



our cost of license revenue primarily consists of amortization of acquired purchased software intangible assets fixed and variable costs associated with reproducing and distributing software and documentation and royalties paid to third parties for technology embedded in or licensed with our software products cost of license revenue as a percent of license revenue can vary depending on product mix sold the effect of fixed and variable royalties and the level of amortization of acquired software intangible assets amortization of acquired purchased software totaled 186 million 158 million and 154 million in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively 

cost of service revenue 

  



our cost of service revenue includes costs such as salaries benefits and computer equipment and facilities for our training and consulting personnel and thirdparty subcontractor fees 

in 2013 compared to 2012 total compensation benefit costs and travel expenses were 1 11 million higher primarily due to higher average headcount year over year and the impact of annual salary increases service headcount at the end of 2013 included approximately 130 employees added from acquisitions the cost of thirdparty consulting services was 118 million lower in 2013 compared to 2012 

the decreases in the use of subcontracted thirdparty consultants in 2013 and 2012 are a result of growing internal capacity and improved utilization and the implementation of our strategy to have our strategic services partners perform services for customers directly all of which have contributed to improving services margins 

in 2012 compared to 2011 total compensation benefit costs and travel expenses were 7 112 million higher primarily due to higher average headcount year over year and the impact of annual salary increases service headcount increased at the end of 2011 by approximately 375 employees compared to the yearago period including approximately 150 employees added from mks and 4cs in the second half of 2011 in the second half of 2012 total headcount and the corresponding compensation benefit costs and travel expenses decreased as a result of restructuring actions in the second and third quarters which resulted in employee terminations the cost of thirdparty consulting services was 59 million lower in 2012 compared to 2011 for the reasons stated above 

cost of support revenue 



our cost of support revenue includes costs such as salaries benefits and computer equipment and facilities associated with customer support and the release of support updates including related royalty costs 

in 2013 compared to 2012 total compensation benefit costs and travel expenses were 8 43 million higher primarily due to increased headcount support headcount at the end of 2013 included approximately 60 employees added from 2013 acquisitions 

in 2012 compared to 2011 total compensation benefit costs and travel expenses were 15 72 million higher primarily due to increased headcount support headcount at the end of 2011included approximately 60 employees added from mks in the second half of 2011 

sales and marketing 

  

our sales and marketing expenses primarily include salaries and benefits sales commissions advertising and marketing programs travel and facility costs our compensation benefit costs and travel expenses were lower by an aggregate of 5 158 million in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to lower headcount sales and marketing headcount at the end of the 2013 included approximately 30 employees added from 2013 acquisitions 

our compensation benefit costs and travel expenses were higher by an aggregate of 7 213 million in 2012 compared to 2011 due to higher average headcount during the year as a result of acquisitions and investments we made in our direct sales force as well as the impact of merit pay increases additionally sales and marketing expenses were higher by 28 million in 2012 compared to 2011 as a result of investments we made in sales technology infrastructure sales meeting and marketing event expenses were lower by approximately 14 million in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to the ptc creo product launch in the first quarter of 2011 

research and development 

  



our research and development expenses consist principally of salaries and benefits costs of computer equipment and facility expenses major research and development activities include developing new releases of our software total compensation benefit costs and travel expenses were higher by 4 60 million in 2013 compared to 2012 research and development headcount at the end of 2013 included approximately 160 employees added from 2013 acquisitions 

total compensation benefit costs and travel expenses were higher in 2012 compared to 2011 by an aggregate of 4 66 million due primarily to the impact of annual salary increases research and development headcount at the end of 2011 included approximately 250 employees from mks and 4cs 

general and administrative 

  



our general and administrative expenses include the costs of our corporate finance information technology human resources legal and administrative functions as well as acquisitionrelated charges bad debt expense and outside professional services including accounting and legal fees acquisitionrelated costs include direct costs of acquisitions and expenses related to acquisition integration activities including transaction fees due diligence costs retention bonuses and severance and professional fees including legal and accounting costs related to the acquisition acquisitionrelated costs were 99 million and 38 million in 2013 and 2012 respectively total compensation benefit costs and travel costs were 5 40 million higher in 2013 compared to 2012 due to higher headcount 

acquisitionrelated costs were 38 million in 2012 compared to 78 million in 2011 total compensation benefit costs and travel costs were 8 62 million higher in 2012 compared to 2011 due to higher headcount for the first six months of 2012 resulting from the acquisitions of mks and 4cs which headcount was partially reduced when the integration of these businesses was subsequently completed the impact of annual salary increases and higher stockbased compensation stockbased compensation was 21 million higher in 2012 compared to 2011 additionally costs for outside professional services were higher by 26 million in 2012 compared to 2011 

amortization of acquired intangible assets 

  



amortization of acquired intangible assets reflects the amortization of acquired nonproduct related intangible assets primarily customer and trademarkrelated intangible assets recorded in connection with completed acquisitions the increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets in 2013 was primarily due to our acquisition of servigistics the increase in 2012 and 2011 compared to the previous periods was due primarily to amortization related to our acquisition of mks 

restructuring charges 

  



as part of our strategy to reduce costs and to realign our business in the second and third quarters of 2012 we implemented a restructuring of our business and recorded restructuring charges of 249 million primarily for severance and related costs associated with approximately 210 employees representing approximately 3 of our workforce we realized approximately 13 million of operating expense savings from these reductions in 2012 

in 2013 as part of our continued strategy to improve profitability we implemented restructuring actions and recorded restructuring charges of 522 million including 509 million for severance and related costs associated with approximately 550 employees and 13 million related to facility consolidations these restructuring actions were substantially completed in 2013 and are expected to result in a 16 million per quarter reduction in operating expenses which is partially reflected in our results for 2013 and contemplated in our 2014 financial goals 

in 2013 2012 and 2011 we made cash payments related to restructuring charges of 372 million  209 million and 05 million respectively at september 30 2013 accrued expenses for unpaid restructuring charges totaled 195 million  which we expect to pay within the next twelve months 

nonoperating income expense 



foreign currency net losses foreign currency net losses include costs of hedging contracts certain realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains or losses and foreign exchange gains or losses resulting from the required periodend currency remeasurement of the assets and liabilities of our subsidiaries that use the us dollar as their functional currency because a large portion of our revenue and expenses is transacted in foreign currencies we engage in hedging transactions involving the use of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates foreign currency losses in 2012 included 08 million related to mks legal entity mergers foreign currency losses in 2011 included 44 million related to our acquisition of mks and the related settlement of forward contracts to purchase cdn292 million and 07 million from a litigation settlement in japan 

interest income interest income represents earnings on the investment of our available cash balances the decrease in interest income in 2012 compared to 2011 was due primarily to lower interest rates 

interest expense interest expense is primarily related to interest on borrowings under our credit facility the increase in interest expense in each of 2013 and 2012 compared to the respective prior year is due to higher average amounts outstanding under our credit facility in those years we had 258 million outstanding under the credit facility at september 30 2013 compared to 370 million at september 30 2012 which included 230 million in proceeds drawn from our credit facility in the fourth quarter of 2012 to finance the servigistics acquisition which closed on october 2 2012 and 200 million outstanding at september 30 2011 we borrowed 250 million in may 2011 in connection with our acquisition of mks the average interest rate on amounts outstanding under the credit facility was 17 in 2013 18 in 2012 and 21 in 2011 

other income expense net the change in other income expense net in 2013 compared to 2012 was due primarily to a legal settlement gain of 51 million recorded in 2013 

income taxes 



in 2013 our effective tax rate was lower than the 35 statutory federal income tax rate due in large part to the reversal of a portion of the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets primarily us we recorded benefits of 367 million resulting from 2013 acquisitions as described below and a benefit of 79 million related to the release of a valuation allowance as a result of a pension gain recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in equity additionally our 2013 tax provision reflects a 20 million  provision related to a research and development rd cost sharing prepayment by a foreign subsidiary to the us a similar prepayment was made in 2012 resulting in a 78 million  provision in that year this impact was offset by a corresponding increase in our valuation allowance in the us other factors impacting the rate include our corporate structure in which our foreign taxes are at an effective tax rate lower than the us rate foreign withholding taxes of 60 million and noncash tax benefits of 53 million recorded as a result of the conclusion of tax audits in several foreign jurisdictions 

acquisitions in the year were accounted for as business combinations assets acquired including the fair value of acquired tangible assets intangible assets including finitelived acquired intangible assets totaling 1335 million and assumed liabilities were recorded and we recorded deferred tax liabilities of 409 million primarily related to the tax effect of the acquired intangible assets that are not deductible for income tax purposes these deferred tax liabilities reduced our deferred tax asset balance and resulted in a tax benefit of 367 million to decrease our valuation allowance in jurisdictions where we have recorded a valuation allowance primarily the us as this decrease in the valuation allowance is not part of the accounting for business combinations the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed it was recorded as an income tax benefit 

in 2012 our effective tax rate was higher than the 35 statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to the recording of a 1245 million charge to the income tax provision related to the establishment of a valuation allowance on us net deferred tax assets as described below this increase was offset in part as a result of our corporate structure in which our foreign taxes are at an effective tax rate lower than the us rate our 2012 provision included a noncash charge of 42 million related to the restructuring of our canadian operations that resulted in a change in the tax status of the foreign legal entity and a noncash charge of 14 million related to the impact of a japanese legislative change on our japan entitys deferred tax assets these charges were excluded from our nongaap earnings per share see income and margins earnings per share  below additionally our 2012 tax provision reflects a 78 million provision related to a research and development cost sharing prepayment by a foreign subsidiary to the us a comparable prepayment was made in 2011 in 2012 we recorded a 20 million  correction to deferred tax benefits on unrecognized actuarial losses related to pension benefits which was not material to the current or prior periods 

in 2011 our effective tax rate was lower than the 35 statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to our corporate structure in which our foreign taxes are at an effective tax rate lower than the us rate and a 23 million tax benefit related to research and development rd triggered by a retroactive extension of the rd tax credit enacted in the first quarter of 2011 our 2011 tax provision reflects a 75 million provision related to a research and development cost sharing prepayment by a foreign subsidiary to the us a similar prepayment was made in 2010 resulting in a 60 million provision in that year as a result the net increase to the 2011 provision was 15 million 

in 2011 we continued the reorganization of our legal entity structure which began in 2010 to support our tax and cash planning the 2011 reorganization resulted in a 464 million taxable gain in the us the tax on this gain was offset in part by the reversal of a deferred tax liability for unremitted earnings of a foreign subsidiary of 65 million established in 2010 in contemplation of this transaction the recognition of foreign tax credits previously not benefitted and foreign tax credits generated as a result of the transaction 

in the fourth quarter of 2012 we recorded a 1245 million  noncash charge to the income tax provision to establish a valuation allowance against substantially all of our us net deferred tax assets we weighed all available evidence both positive and negative and concluded that it was more likely than not a likelihood of more than 50 percent that substantially all of our us deferred tax assets will not be realized the realization of deferred tax assets including carryforwards and deductible temporary differences depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the same character during the carryback or carryforward period we considered all sources of taxable income available to realize the deferred tax assets including the future reversal of existing temporary differences future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards taxable income in prior carryback years and taxplanning strategies 

in the normal course of business ptc and its subsidiaries are examined by various taxing authorities including the internal revenue service irs in the united states we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate we are currently under audit by tax authorities in several foreign jurisdictions audits by tax authorities typically involve examination of the deductibility of certain permanent items limitations on net operating losses and tax credits although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in material changes in our estimates 

our future effective income tax rate may be materially impacted by the amount of income taxes associated with our foreign earnings which are taxed at rates different from the us federal statutory income tax rate as well as the timing and extent of the realization of deferred tax assets and changes in the tax law further our tax rate may fluctuate within a fiscal year including from quarter to quarter due to items arising from discrete events including settlements of tax audits and assessments the resolution or identification of tax position uncertainties and acquisitions of other companies 

nongaap measures 

the nongaap measures presented in the above discussion of our results of operations and the respective most directly comparable gaap measures are 

 the nongaap measures exclude a fair value adjustment related to acquired deferred support revenue stockbased compensation expense amortization of acquired intangible assets expense acquisitionrelated charges restructuring charges identified gains or charges included in nonoperating other income expense and the related tax effects of the preceding items and identified tax items these items are normally included in the comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 

fair value of acquired deferred support revenue  is a purchase accounting adjustment recorded to reduce acquired deferred support revenue to the fair value of the remaining obligation 

stockbased compensation expense  is noncash expense relating to stockbased awards issued to executive officers employees and outside directors consisting of restricted stock stock options and restricted stock units 

amortization of acquired intangible assets expense  is a noncash expense that is impacted by the timing and magnitude of our acquisitions we believe the assessment of our operations excluding these costs is relevant to our assessment of internal operations and comparisons to the performance of other companies in our industry 

acquisitionrelated charges  are included in general and administrative expenses and include direct costs of potential and completed acquisitions and expenses related to acquisition integration activities including transaction fees due diligence costs severance and professional fees these costs are not considered part of our normal operations as the occurrence and amount will vary depending on the timing and size of acquisitions and the level of integration activity undertaken 

restructuring charges  include excess facility restructuring charges and severance costs resulting from reductions of personnel driven by modifications to our business strategy and not as part of our normal operations these costs may vary in size based on our restructuring plan 

we use these nongaap measures and we believe that they assist our investors to make periodtoperiod comparisons of our operational performance because they provide a view of our operating results without items that are not in our view indicative of our core operating results we believe that these nongaap measures help illustrate underlying trends in our business and we use the measures to establish budgets and operational goals communicated internally and externally for managing our business and evaluating our performance we believe that providing nongaap measures affords investors a view of our operating results that may be more easily compared to the results of peer companies in addition compensation of our executives is based in part on the performance of our business based on these nongaap measures 

the items excluded from the nongaap measures often have a material impact on our financial results and such items often recur accordingly the nongaap measures included in this annual report should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for or superior to the comparable measures prepared in accordance with gaap 

the following tables reconcile each of these nongaap measures to its most closely comparable gaap measure on our financial statements 

  



  

 critical accounting policies and estimates 

we have prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america in preparing our financial statements we make estimates assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our reported revenues results of operations and net income as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet these estimates assumptions and judgments are necessary because future events and their effects on our results and the value of our assets cannot be determined with certainty and are made based on our historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances these estimates may change as new events occur or additional information is obtained and we may periodically be faced with uncertainties the outcomes of which are not within our control and may not be known for a prolonged period of time 

the accounting policies methods and estimates used to prepare our financial statements are described generally in note b of “notes to consolidated financial statements” the most important accounting judgments and estimates that we made in preparing the financial statements involved 

 a critical accounting policy is one that is both material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires us to make difficult subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies require us to make assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time of the estimate and different estimates that we could have used or changes in the estimates that are reasonably likely to occur may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process actual results could differ from those estimates 

accounting policies guidelines and interpretations related to our critical accounting policies and estimates are generally subject to numerous sources of authoritative guidance and are often reexamined by accounting standards rule makers and regulators these rule makers andor regulators may promulgate interpretations guidance or regulations that may result in changes to our accounting policies which could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 

revenue recognition 

we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with determining the amounts of software license and services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period 

our primary judgments involve the following 

 we derive revenues from three primary sources 1 software licenses 2 support and 3 services 

we recognize revenue when 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 2 delivery has occurred generally fob shipping point or electronic distribution 3 the fee is fixed or determinable and 4 collection is probable 

our software is distributed primarily through our direct sales force in addition we have an indirect distribution channel through alliances with resellers revenue arrangements with resellers are recognized on a sellthrough basis that is when we deliver the product to the enduser customer we record consideration given to a reseller as a reduction of revenue to the extent we have recorded revenue from the reseller we do not offer contractual rights of return stock balancing or price protection to our resellers and actual product returns from them have been insignificant to date as a result we do not maintain reserves for reseller product returns 

at the time of each sale transaction we must make an assessment of the collectability of the amount due from the customer revenue is only recognized at that time if management deems that collection is probable in making this assessment we consider customer creditworthiness and historical payment experience at that same time we assess whether fees are fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties in assessing whether the fee is fixed or determinable we consider the payment terms of the transaction including transactions with payment terms that extend beyond our customary payment terms and our collection experience in similar transactions without making concessions among other factors we have periodically provided financing to creditworthy customers with payment terms up to 24 months if the fee is determined not to be fixed or determinable revenue is recognized only as payments become due from the customer provided that all other revenue recognition criteria are met our software license arrangements generally do not include customer acceptance provisions however if an arrangement includes an acceptance provision we record revenue only upon the earlier of 1 receipt of written acceptance from the customer or 2 expiration of the acceptance period 

our software arrangements often include implementation and consulting services that are sold under consulting engagement contracts or as part of the software license arrangement when we determine that such services are not essential to the functionality of the licensed software we record revenue separately for the license and service elements of these arrangements provided that appropriate evidence of fair value exists for the undelivered services see discussion below generally we consider that a service is not essential to the functionality of the software based on various factors including if the services may be provided by independent third parties experienced in providing such consulting and implementation in coordination with dedicated customer personnel and whether the services result in significant modification or customization of the software functionality when consulting services qualify for separate accounting consulting revenues under time and materials billing arrangements are recognized as the services are performed consulting revenues under fixedpriced contracts are generally recognized as the services are performed using a proportionate performance model with hours or costs as the input method of attribution when we provide consulting services considered essential to the functionality of the software the arrangement does not qualify for separate accounting of the license and service elements and the license revenue is recognized together with the consulting services using the percentageofcompletion method of contract accounting under such arrangements consideration is recognized as the services are performed as measured by an observable input in these circumstances we separate license revenue from service revenue for income statement presentation by allocating vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value of the consulting services as service revenue and the residual portion as license revenue under the percentageofcompletion method we estimate the stage of completion of contracts with fixed or 

“not to exceed” fees based on hours or costs incurred to date as compared with estimated total project hours or costs at completion adjustments to estimates to complete are made in the periods in which facts resulting in a change become known when total cost estimates exceed revenues we accrue for the estimated losses when identified the use of the proportionate performance and percentageofcompletion methods of accounting require significant judgment relative to estimating total contract costs or hours hours being a proxy for costs including assumptions relative to the length of time to complete the project the nature and complexity of the work to be performed and anticipated changes in salaries and other costs 

we generally use the residual method to recognize revenue from software arrangements that include one or more elements to be delivered at a future date when evidence of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists and the elements of the arrangement qualify for separate accounting as described above under the residual method the fair value of the undelivered elements ie support and services based on vsoe is deferred and the remaining portion of the total arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements ie software license if evidence of the fair value of one or more of the undelivered elements does not exist all revenues are deferred and recognized when delivery of all of those elements has occurred or when fair values can be established we determine vsoe of the fair value of services and support revenue based upon our recent pricing for those elements when sold separately for certain transactions vsoe of the fair value of support revenue is determined based on a substantive support renewal clause within a customer contract our current pricing practices are influenced primarily by product type purchase volume sales channel and customer location we review services and support sold separately on a periodic basis and update when appropriate our vsoe of fair value for such elements to ensure that it reflects our recent pricing experience 

generally our contracts are accounted for individually however when contracts are closely interrelated and dependent on each other it may be necessary to account for two or more contracts as one to reflect the substance of the group of contracts 

for subscriptionbased licenses license revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement in limited circumstances where the right to use the software license is contingent upon current payments of support fees for software license and support are recognized ratably over the initial support term 

support contracts generally include rights to unspecified upgrades when and if available telephone and internetbased support updates and bug fixes support revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the support contract on a straightline basis 

reimbursements of outofpocket expenditures incurred in connection with providing consulting services are included in service revenue with the offsetting expense recorded in cost of service revenue 

training services include onsite and classroom training training revenues are recognized as the related training services are provided 

accounting for income taxes 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to calculate our income tax expense based on taxable income by jurisdiction there are many transactions and calculations about which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain as a result our calculations involve estimates by management some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenuesharing costreimbursement and transfer pricing arrangements among related entities and the differing tax treatment of revenue and cost items across various jurisdictions if we were compelled to revise or to account differently for our arrangements that revision could affect our tax liability 

the income tax accounting process also involves estimating our actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheets we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized we must establish a valuation allowance as a charge to income tax expense 

as of september 30 2013 we have a valuation allowance of 1299 million against net deferred tax assets in the us and a valuation allowance of 266 million against net deferred tax assets in certain foreign jurisdictions in the fourth quarter of 2012 we recorded a 1245 million  noncash charge to the income tax provision to establish a valuation allowance against substantially all of our us net deferred tax assets we weighed all available evidence both positive and negative and concluded that it was more likely than not a likelihood of more than 50 percent that substantially all of our us deferred tax assets will not be realized the realization of deferred tax assets including carryforwards and deductible temporary differences depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the same character during the carryback or carryforward period we considered all sources of taxable income available to realize the deferred tax assets including the future reversal of existing 

temporary differences future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards taxable income in prior carryback years and taxplanning strategies 

the valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets of certain foreign jurisdictions is established primarily for our net operating loss carryforwards the majority of which do not expire there are limitations imposed on the utilization of such net operating losses that could further restrict the recognition of any tax benefits 

we have not provided for us income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on foreign unrepatriated earnings as it is our current intention to permanently reinvest these earnings outside the us unless it can be done with no significant tax cost if we decide to change this assertion in the future to repatriate any additional nonus earnings we may be required to establish a deferred tax liability on such earnings 

in the normal course of business ptc and its subsidiaries are examined by various taxing authorities including the internal revenue service irs in the united states we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate we are currently under audit by tax authorities in several foreign jurisdictions audits by tax authorities typically involve examination of the deductibility of certain permanent items limitations on net operating losses and tax credits although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in material changes in our estimates 

valuation of assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations 

in accordance with business combination accounting we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values determining these fair values requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets 

our identifiable intangible assets acquired consist of developed technology core technology tradenames customer lists and contracts and software support agreements and related relationships developed technology consists of products that have reached technological feasibility core technology represents a combination of processes inventions and trade secrets related to the design and development of acquired products customer lists and contracts and software support agreements and related relationships represent the underlying relationships and agreements with customers of the acquired company’s installed base we have generally valued intangible assets using a discounted cash flow model critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to 

 in addition we estimate the useful lives of our intangible assets based upon the expected period over which we anticipate generating economic benefits from the related intangible asset 

net tangible assets consist of the fair values of tangible assets less the fair values of assumed liabilities and obligations except for deferred revenues net tangible assets were generally valued by us at the respective carrying amounts recorded by the acquired company if we believed that their carrying values approximated their fair values at the acquisition date the values assigned to deferred revenue reflect an amount equivalent to the estimated cost plus an appropriate profit margin to perform the services related to the acquired company’s software support contracts 

in addition uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date and we reevaluate these items quarterly with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill provided that we are within the measurement period up to one year from the acquisition date and we continue to collect information in order to determine their estimated values subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the estimated value of uncertain tax positions or tax related valuation allowances whichever comes first changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations 

our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable at that time but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions estimates or actual results 

when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a finitelived intangible asset may not be recoverable we perform an assessment of the asset for potential impairment this assessment is based on projected undiscounted future cash flows over the asset’s remaining life if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its undiscounted cash flows we record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset determined using projected discounted future cash flows of the asset 

valuation of goodwill 

our goodwill totaled 7691 million and 6103 million  as of september 30 2013 and 2012 respectively we have two operating segments 1 software products and 2 services we assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level our reporting units are determined based on the components of our operating segments that constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and for which operating results are regularly reviewed by segment management our reporting units are consistent with our operating segments as of september 30 2013 and 2012 goodwill and acquired intangible assets in the aggregate attributable to our software products reportable segment was 9793 million  and 7681 million  respectively and attributable to our services reportable segment was 629 million  and 281 million  respectively we test goodwill for impairment in the third quarter of our fiscal year or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting segment below its carrying value factors we consider important on an overall company basis and reportable segment basis as applicable that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results significant changes in our use of the acquired assets or a significant change in the strategy for our business significant negative industry or economic trends a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period or a reduction of our market capitalization relative to net book value 

 our 2013 goodwill impairment assessment was based on a qualitative assessment on july 2 2011 the estimated fair value of each reporting unit was approximately double its carrying value or higher because our fair value was well in excess of our carrying value on that date and there were no other indicators that our goodwill had become impaired since that date we elected to perform a qualitative assessment to test each reporting unit’s goodwill for impairment based on our qualitative assessment if we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not ie a likelihood of more than 50 percent to be greater than its carrying amount no additional testing will be performed if we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not to be less than its carrying amount the two step impairment test will be performed in the first step we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform further testing if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill if the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference 

we completed our annual goodwill impairment review as of june 29 2013 based on a qualitative assessment our qualitative assessment included company specific financial performance and longrange plans industry and macroeconomic factors as well as a sensitivity analysis of key model assumptions based on our qualitative assessment we concluded it was morelikelythannot that the fair values of our reporting units exceed their carrying values and that no further impairment testing was required 

accounting for pensions 

we sponsor several us and international pension plans we make assumptions that are used in calculating the expense and liability of these plans these key assumptions include the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate used to determine the present value of benefit obligations in selecting the expected longterm rate of return on assets we consider the average future rate of earnings expected on the funds invested to provide for the benefits under the pension plan this includes considering the plans asset allocations and the expected returns likely to be earned over the life of the plans the discount rate reflects the estimated rate at which an amount that is invested in a portfolio of highquality debt instruments would provide the future cash flows necessary to pay benefits when they come due the actuarial assumptions used by us may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions or longer or shorter life spans of the participants our actual results could differ materially from those we estimated which could require us to record a greater amount of pension expense in future years andor require higher than expected cash contributions 

in the us we sponsor a frozen pension plan covering mostly inactive participants the us discount rate is determined using a bondmatching tool under this tool discount rates are derived by identifying a theoretical settlement portfolio of high quality bonds sufficient to provide for the pension plans projected benefit payments a single rate is then determined that results in a discounted value of the plans benefit payments that equates to the market value of the selected bonds    in 

determining our us pension cost for 2013 2012 and 2011 we used a discount rate of 400  450  and 500  respectively and an expected return on plan assets of 725 for all three years 

certain of our international subsidiaries principally germany also sponsor pension plans accounting and reporting for these plans requires the use of countryspecific assumptions for discount rates and expected rates of return on assets we apply a consistent methodology in determining the key assumptions that in addition to future experience assumptions such as mortality rates are used by our actuaries to determine our liability and expense for each of these plans the discount rate for germany was selected with reference to a spotrate yield curve based on the yields of aarated eurodenominated corporate bonds in addition our actuarial consultants determine the expense and liabilities of the plan using other assumptions for future experience such as mortality rates in determining our pension cost for 2013 2012 and 2011 we used weighted average discount rates of 34  48  and 40  respectively and weighted average expected returns on plan assets of 54  54  and 56  respectively 

in 2013  and 2012 our actual return on plan assets for all plans was 136 million  and 165 million  respectively compared to a loss of 16 million  in 2011  

continued distress in global financial markets has caused among other things extreme volatility in security prices severely diminished liquidity and credit availability rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuation of others if actual returns are below our expected rates of return it will impact the amount and timing of future contributions and expense for these plans 

as of september 30 2013 and 2012 our plans in total were underfunded representing the difference between our projected benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets by 501 million  and 763 million  respectively the projected benefit obligation as of september 30 2013 was determined using a discount rate of 49  for the us plan and a weighted average discount rate of 33  for our international plans the most sensitive assumptions used in calculating the expense and liability of our pension plans are the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets total net periodic pension cost was 55 million  in 2013 and we expect it to be approximately 3 million  in 2014 a 50 basis point change to our discount rate and expected return on plan assets assumptions would have changed our pension expense for the year ended september 30 2013 by approximately 1 million a 50 basis point decrease in our discount rate assumptions would increase our projected benefit obligation as of september 30 2013 by approximately 14 million 

legal contingencies 

we are periodically subject to various legal claims and involved in various legal proceedings we routinely review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any matter is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we record a liability for the estimated loss significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether the amount of an exposure is reasonably estimable because of inherent uncertainties related to these legal matters we base our loss accruals on the best information available at the time further estimates of this nature are highly subjective and the final outcome of these matters could vary significantly from the amounts that have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as additional information becomes available we reassess our potential liability and may revise our estimates such revisions could have a material impact on future quarterly or annual results of operations

cash provided by operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities was 2247 million  in 2013 compared to 2180 million  in 2012 cash provided by operations was higher due to higher earnings nongaap net income was 2192 million in 2013 compared to 1829 million in 2012 partially offset by higher restructuring payments 37 million in 2013 compared to 21 million in the 2012 and 7 million of payments to satisfy compensationrelated accruals assumed from servigistics accounts receivable days sales outstanding was 60 days as of september 30 2013 compared to 61 days as of september 30 2012

credit facility 

in august 2012 we entered into a multicurrency credit facility the credit facility with a syndicate of ten banks for which jpmorgan chase bank na acts as administrative agent the credit facility replaced a revolving credit facility with the same banks the previous credit facility entered into in august 2010 we expect to use the credit facility for general corporate purposes including acquisitions of businesses and working capital requirements the credit facility consists of a 150 million term loan and a 300 million revolving loan commitment and may be increased by an additional 150 million in the form of revolving loans or term loans or a combination thereof if the existing or additional lenders are willing to make such increased commitments the revolving loan commitment does not require amortization of principal the term loan requires repayment of principal at the end of each calendar quarter the revolving loan and term loan may be repaid in whole or in part prior to the scheduled maturity dates at our option without penalty or premium the credit facility matures on august 16 2017 when all remaining amounts outstanding will be due and payable in full we are required to make principal payments under the term loan of 150 million 150 million 225 million and 900 million in 2014 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively 

 as of september 30 2013  we had 2581 million  outstanding under the credit facility comprised of 1425 million  under the term loan and a 1156 million  revolving loan as of september 30 2012 the balance outstanding under the credit facility was 370 million including 230 million borrowed in connection with our acquisition of servigistics in september 2012 

the credit facility limits ptcs and its subsidiaries ability to among other things incur additional indebtedness incur liens or guarantee obligations pay dividends other than to ptc and make other distributions make investments and enter into joint ventures dispose of assets and engage in transactions with affiliates except on an armslength basis under the credit facility ptc and its material domestic subsidiaries may not invest cash or property in or loan to ptcs foreign subsidiaries in aggregate amounts exceeding 50 million for any purpose and an additional 75 million for acquisitions of businesses in addition under the credit facility ptc and its subsidiaries must maintain the following financial ratios

to 100 and we were in compliance with all financial and operating covenants of the credit facility 

for a description of additional terms and conditions of the credit facility including limitations on our ability to undertake certain actions see note h debt in the “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

expectations for fiscal 2014 

we believe that existing cash and cash equivalents together with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements through at least the next twelve months and to meet our known longterm capital requirements in addition we expect to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in 2014 to repay approximately 100 million outstanding under our credit facility and to repurchase approximately 75 million worth of shares of our common stock capital expenditures in 2014 are currently anticipated to be approximately 29 million 

we have evaluated and expect to continue to evaluate possible strategic transactions on an ongoing basis and at any given time may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to possible strategic transactions our expected uses of cash could change our cash position could be reduced and we may incur additional debt if we complete any significant acquisitions 

at september 30 2013 we had cash and cash equivalents of 304 million in the united states 979 million in europe 899 million in the pacific rim including india 133 million in japan and 104 million in other nonus countries as of september 30 2013 we had an outstanding intercompany loan receivable of 1544 million owed to the us from our top tier 

foreign subsidiary primarily resulting from our business reorganizations described in note g income taxes  in the “notes to consolidated financial statements” this amount can be repaid with cash generated by our foreign subsidiaries and repatriated to the us without tax cost

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we face exposure to financial market risks including adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 

foreign currency exchange risk 

our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to western european countries japan china and canada we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates that arise from receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies we do not enter into or hold foreign currency derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes nor do we enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge future cash flow or forecast transactions 

our nonus revenues generally are transacted through our nonus subsidiaries and typically are denominated in their local currency in addition expenses that are incurred by our nonus subsidiaries typically are denominated in their local currency in 2013 2012 and 2011 approximately twothirds of our revenue and half of our expenses were transacted in currencies other than the us dollar currency translation affects our reported results because we report our results of operations in us dollars historically our most significant currency risk has been changes in the euro and japanese yen relative to the us dollar based on 2013 revenue and expense levels excluding restructuring charges a 010 change in the usd to european exchange rates and a 10 yen change in the yen to usd exchange rate would impact operating income by approximately 13 million and 7 million respectively 

our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations arises in part from intercompany transactions with most intercompany transactions occurring between a us dollar functional currency entity and a foreign currency denominated entity intercompany transactions typically are denominated in the local currency of the nonus dollar functional currency subsidiary in order to centralize foreign currency risk also both ptc the parent company and our nonus subsidiaries may transact business with our customers and vendors in a currency other than their functional currency transaction risk in addition we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results and balances of our nonus subsidiaries are translated into us dollars translation risk if sales to customers outside of the united states increase our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will increase 

our foreign currency risk management strategy is principally designed to mitigate the future potential financial impact of changes in the us dollar value of balances denominated in foreign currency resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates our foreign currency hedging program uses forward contracts to manage the foreign currency exposures that exist as part of our ongoing business operations the contracts primarily are denominated in canadian dollars and european currencies and have maturities of less than three months 

generally we do not designate foreign currency forward contracts as hedges for accounting purposes and changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized immediately in earnings because we enter into forward contracts only as an economic hedge any gain or loss on the underlying foreigndenominated balance would be offset by the loss or gain on the forward contract gains and losses on forward contracts and foreign denominated receivables and payables are included in foreign currency net losses 

as of september 30 2013  and 2012  we had outstanding forward contracts with notional amounts equivalent to the following 

  



debt 

as of september 30 2013 the amount outstanding under our variablerate credit facility was 2581 million including a term loan of 1425 million and a revolving credit facility of 1156 million loans under the credit facility bear interest at variable rates which reset every 30  to 180  days depending on the rate and period selected by the company these loans are subject to interest rate risk as interest rates will be adjusted at each rollover date to the extent such amounts are not repaid as of september 30 2013  the annual rate on the term loan was 15625  which reset on november 15 2013 to 150  and the annual interest rate on the revolving loan was 15625  if there was a hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates the annual net impact to earnings and cash flows would be 26 million this hypothetical change in cash flows and earnings has been calculated based on the borrowings outstanding at september 30 2013 and a 100 basis point per annum change in interest rate applied over a oneyear period 

cash and cash equivalents 

as of september 30 2013 cash equivalents were invested in highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased we invest our cash with highly rated financial institutions in north america europe and asiapacific and in diversified domestic and international money market mutual funds at september 30 2013 we had cash and cash equivalents of 979 million in europe 304 million in the united states 899 million in the pacific rim including india 133 million in japan and 104 million in other nonus countries given the short maturities and investment grade quality of the portfolio holdings at september 30 2013 a hypothetical 10 change in interest rates would not materially affect the fair value of our cash and cash equivalents 

our invested cash is subject to interest rate fluctuations and for nonus operations foreign currency risk in a declining interest rate environment we would experience a decrease in interest income the opposite holds true in a rising interest rate environment over the past several years the us federal reserve board european central bank and bank of england have changed certain benchmark interest rates which have led to declines and increases in market interest rates these changes in market interest rates have resulted in fluctuations in interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents interest income will continue to fluctuate based on changes in market interest rates and levels of cash available for investment our consolidated cash balances were impacted unfavorably by 13 million in 2013 and favorably by 07 million and 64 million in 2012 and 2011 respectively due to changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar particularly the euro and the japanese yen

we invest heavily in research and development to improve the quality and expand the functionality of our products approximately one third of our employees are dedicated to research and development initiatives conducted primarily in the united states israel and india 

our research and development expenses were 2150 million in 2012 2114 million in 2011 and 2016 million in 2010 additional information about our research and development expenditures may be found in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—results of operations—costs and expenses—research and development” of this annual report 

sales and marketing 

we derive most of our revenue from products and services sold directly by our sales force to enduser customers we also sell products and services through thirdparty resellers and other strategic partners our sales force focuses on large accounts while our reseller channel provides a costeffective means of covering the small and mediumsize business market our strategic services partners provide product andor service offerings that complement our offerings 

competition 

we compete in the product development market including the product lifecycle management plm application lifecycle management alm and cad computer aided design manufacturing and engineering markets the supply chain management scm market and the service lifecycle management slm market we compete with a number of companies that offer solutions that address one or more specific functional areas covered by our solutions including dassault systèmes sa and siemens ag for traditional cad solutions plm solutions manufacturing planning solutions and visualization and digital mockup solutions oracle corporation and sap ag for plm solutions scm solutions and slm solutions and ibm corporation and hewlettpackard company for alm solutions we believe our plm solutions are more specifically targeted toward the product development processes within manufacturing companies and offer broader and deeper functionality for those processes than erpbased solutions we also compete in the cad market with design products such as autodesk incs inventor siemens ags solid edge and dassault systemes sas solidworks for sales to smaller manufacturing customers 

proprietary rights 

our software products and related technical knowhow along with our trademarks including our company names product names and logos are proprietary we protect our intellectual property rights in these items by relying on copyrights trademarks patents and common law safeguards including trade secret protection the nature and extent of such legal protection depends in part on the type of intellectual property right and the relevant jurisdiction in the us we are generally able to maintain our trademark registrations for as long as the trademarks are in use and to maintain our patents for up to 20 years from the earliest effective filing date we also use license management and other antipiracy technology measures as well as contractual restrictions to curtail the unauthorized use and distribution of our products 

our proprietary rights are subject to risks and uncertainties described under item 1a “risk factors” below you should read that discussion which is incorporated into this section by reference 

backlog 

we generally ship our products within 30 days after receipt of a customer order a high percentage of our license revenue historically has been generated in the third month of each fiscal quarter and this revenue tends to be concentrated in the latter part of that month accordingly orders may exist at the end of a quarter that have not been shipped and not been recognized as revenue we do not believe that our backlog at any particular point in time is indicative of future sales levels 

employees

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend the following are important factors we have identified that could affect our future results you should consider them carefully when evaluating forwardlooking statements made by us including those contained in this annual report because these factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in forwardlooking statements the risks described below are not the only risks we face additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business financial condition andor operating results 

i operational considerations 

our operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter making future operating results difficult to predict 

our quarterly operating results historically have fluctuated and are likely to continue to fluctuate depending on a number of factors including 

 accordingly our quarterly results are difficult to predict prior to the end of the quarter and we may be unable to confirm or adjust expectations with respect to our operating results for a particular quarter until that quarter has closed any failure to meet our quarterly revenue or earnings targets could adversely impact the market price of our stock 

economic weakness in the united states and globally may adversely affect our business 

the past four years have been characterized by weak global economic conditions tight credit markets reduced liquidity and extreme volatility in many financial markets we experienced a significant decline in revenue in 2009 in all geographic regions in which we operate as customers reduced or deferred purchases of our products and services although revenue increased year over year in each of 2010 2011 and 2012 the economic environment remains uncertain if the economic environment does not improve or deteriorates our business may be unfavorably impacted 

we depend on sales within the discrete manufacturing market and our revenue is likely to decrease if manufacturing activity slows 

a large amount of our revenues are related to sales to customers in the discrete manufacturing sector a decline in general economic or business conditions or a decline in spending in the manufacturing sector could cause customers to reduce or defer spending on our products which would cause our revenue and earnings to decrease or to grow more slowly we are seeing a decline in manufacturing activity in china and other geographic regions and corresponding decreases in spending by customers which we expect will adversely affect our revenue until conditions improve 

we face significant competition which may reduce our profits and limit or reduce our market share 

the market for product development solutions is rapidly changing and very competitive this competition could result in price reductions for our products and services reduced margins and loss of market share our primary competition comes from 

 5 

 the cad market is characterized by intense competition for customers the nature of this market which is relatively mature and whose growth has slowed and the number and nature of the competitive products which have increasingly similar functionality make it difficult to gain new customers moreover decreasing product differentiation and the training data conversion and other startup costs associated with system replacement make it more difficult to dislodge incumbent design systems although we saw increased revenue from this market in 2011 following the introduction of our new suite of ptc creo solutions in 2011 and renewed demand for cad products which had been soft in 2009 and 2010 demand for ptc creo may decline as customers complete purchases of ptc creo sufficient for their operations 

we must continually modify and enhance our products to keep pace with changing technology and to address our customers’ needs and expectations and any failure to do so could reduce demand for our products 

our ability to remain competitive will depend on our ability to enhance our current offerings and develop new products and services that keep pace with technological developments and meet evolving customer requirements in addition our solutions must meet customer expectations to be successful if our solutions fail to meet customer expectations customers may discontinue adoption of our solutions resulting in a loss of potential additional sales and we may be unable to retain existing customers or attract new customers 

our financial condition could be adversely affected if significant errors or defects are found in our software 

sophisticated software can sometimes contain errors defects or other performance problems if errors or defects are discovered in our current or future products we may need to expend significant financial technical and management resources or divert some of our development resources in order to resolve or work around those defects and we may not be able to correct them in a timely manner or provide an adequate response to our customers 

errors defects or other performance problems in our products could cause us to delay new product releases or customer deployments any such delays could cause delays in our ability to realize revenue from the licensing and shipment of new or enhanced products and give our competitors a greater opportunity to market competing products such difficulties could also cause us to lose customers technical problems or the loss of customers could also damage our business reputation and cause us to lose new business opportunities 

businesses we acquire may not generate the revenue and earnings we anticipated and may otherwise adversely affect our business 

we have acquired and intend to continue to acquire new businesses and technologies if we fail to successfully integrate and manage the businesses and technologies we acquire our operating results may be adversely affected 

moreover business combinations also involve a number of risks and uncertainties that can adversely affect our operations and operating results including 

 we are dependent on key personnel whose loss could impair our operations our product development or our sales efforts 

our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial technical and sales personnel 

we require highly skilled technical personnel to develop our products competition for such personnel in our industry is intense if we are unable to attract and retain technical personnel with the requisite skills our product development efforts could be delayed which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

our sales efforts rely on having a sufficient number of sales representatives and sales support personnel with the skills and knowledge necessary to sell our products including an ability to educate our customers about our products in order to create and meet demand for our products if we are unable to attract or retain sales and sales support personnel with the requisite expertise our revenue could be adversely affected 

at times we provide extended payment terms to our customers which may be a factor in our customers’ purchasing decisions and our revenues could be adversely affected if we ceased making these terms available 

we have provided extended payment terms to certain customers in connection with transactions we have completed with them providing extended payment terms may positively influence our customers’ purchasing decisions but may reduce our cash flows in the shortterm if we reduce the amount of extended payment terms we provide to customers customers might reduce or defer the amount they spend on our products from the amount they might otherwise have spent if extended payment terms were available to them if this were to occur our revenue or revenue growth could be lower than in prior periods andor lower than we expect 

we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights 

our software products and trademarks including our company names product names and logos are proprietary we protect our intellectual property rights in these items by relying on copyrights trademarks patents and common law safeguards including trade secret protection as well as restrictions on disclosures and transferability contained in our agreements with other parties despite these measures the laws of all relevant jurisdictions may not afford adequate protection to our products and other intellectual property in addition we frequently encounter attempts by individuals and companies to pirate our software solutions if our measures to protect our intellectual property rights fail others may be able to use those rights which could reduce our competitiveness and revenues 

intellectual property infringement claims could be asserted against us which could be expensive to defend and could result in limitations on our use of the claimed intellectual property 

the software industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding copyright patent and other intellectual property rights while we have not had any significant claims of this type asserted against us such claims could be asserted against us in the future if a lawsuit of this type is filed it could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel we cannot be sure that we would prevail against any such asserted claims if we did not prevail we could be prevented from using the claimed intellectual property or required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements which might not be available on terms acceptable to us in addition to possible claims with respect to our proprietary products some of our products contain technology developed by and licensed from third parties and we may likewise be susceptible to infringement claims with respect to these thirdparty technologies 

our sales and operations are globally dispersed which exposes us to additional operating and compliance risks 

we sell and deliver software and services and maintain support operations in a large number of countries whose laws and practices differ from one another north america accounted for 38 europe for 38 and asiapacific for 24 of our revenue in 2012 managing these geographically dispersed operations requires significant attention and resources to ensure compliance with laws accordingly while we strive to maintain a comprehensive compliance program we cannot guarantee that an employee agent or business partner will not act in violation of our policies or us or other applicable laws such violations can lead to civil andor criminal prosecutions substantial fines and the revocation of our rights to continue certain operations and also cause business and reputation loss for example we are currently investigating payments and expenses by certain business partners and employees in china that raise questions of compliance with laws including the foreign corrupt practices act andor compliance with our business policies 

our cost structure is relatively fixed in the short term which makes it difficult to reduce our expenses quickly in response to declines in revenue or revenue growth 

we make expenditures to support our revenue growth in advance of achieving the expected revenue our expenses associated with headcount and facilities can be difficult to reduce quickly due to the nature of those items if revenue does not grow as we expect or if it declines our expenses may constitute a larger percentage of our operating budget than we planned which would adversely affect our profitability 

consulting and training services margins are significantly lower than license and maintenance margins increases in consulting and training services revenue as a percent of total revenue could decrease our overall margins 

because our enterprise license solutions generally require more services to implement than our desktop license solutions and because enterprise solutions represent an increasing percentage of our revenue services revenue as a percent of total revenue may increase future projected improvements in our operating margin percent are predicated in part on our ability to improve consulting and training services margins through operating efficiencies if our services revenue increases as a percentage of total revenue andor if we are unable to improve our services margins our overall operating margin may not increase to the levels we expect or may decrease which could adversely impact our stock price 

our current research and development efforts may not generate revenue for several years if at all 

developing and localizing software products is expensive and the investment in product development often involves a long return on investment cycle we have made and expect to continue to make significant investments in research and development and related product opportunities that could adversely affect our operating results if not offset by revenue increases we believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position 

a significant portion of our revenue is generated from maintenance contracts decreases in maintenance renewal rates or a decrease in the number of new licenses we sell would negatively impact our future maintenance revenue and operating results 

a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from maintenance contracts these contracts are generally renewed on an annual basis and typically have a high rate of customer renewal in addition to the recurring revenue base associated with these contracts a majority of customers purchasing new perpetual licenses also purchase related annual maintenance contracts if the rate of renewal for these contracts or the sale of new licenses is adversely affected by economic or other factors our maintenance revenue growth and profitability will be adversely affected 

we may have exposure to additional tax liabilities and our effective tax rate may increase or fluctuate which could increase our income tax expense and reduce our net income 

as a multinational organization we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes in the us and in various foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision and other tax liabilities in the ordinary course of a global business there are many intercompany transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain our tax returns are subject to review by various taxing authorities although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable there is no assurance that the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 

our effective tax rate can be adversely affected by several factors many of which are outside of our control including 

 our sales to government clients subject us to risks of funding approvals 

we derive revenues from contracts with the us government state and local governments and their respective agencies there is increased pressure for governments and their agencies to reduce spending many of our federal government contracts contain fiscal funding clauses whereby ongoing funding of the contracts is subject to approval of appropriations by the us congress similarly our contracts at the state and local levels are subject to government funding authorizations although we have no indication that funding for current contracts will not be approved if additional funding for these contracts is not approved it could reduce revenue we have recognized and reduce future revenue from such contracts 

ii other considerations 

we have been investigating certain matters in china which matters and related remedial actions could have an adverse effect on our business and our results 

we have been investigating payments and expenses by certain business partners and employees in china that raise questions of compliance with laws including the foreign corrupt practices act andor compliance with our business policies in connection with this matter we have terminated certain employees and business partners in china which may have an adverse impact on our level of sales in china until replacements for those employees and business partners are in place and productive revenue from china has historically represented 6 to 7  of our total revenue we have voluntarily disclosed the results of our investigation and associated remedial actions to the united states department of justice and the securities and exchange commission and are continuing to provide additional information as requested by those agencies with respect to this matter resolution of this matter could include fines or other sanctions but we are unable to estimate an amount if any 

we are required to comply with certain financial and operating covenants under our credit facility and any failure to comply with those covenants could cause amounts borrowed under the facility to become immediately due and payable or prevent us from borrowing under the facility 

our credit facility which consists of a 150 million term loan and a 300 million revolving loan with an accordion feature that allows us to borrow up to an additional 150 million if the existing or additional lenders agree matures on august 16 2017 at which time any amounts outstanding will be due and payable in full as of september 30 2012 we had 370 million outstanding under the credit facility primarily related to our acquisition of mks in the third quarter of 2011 and servigistics in october 2012 we may wish to borrow additional amounts under the facility in the future to support our operations including for strategic acquisitions 

we are required to comply with specified financial and operating covenants which limit our ability to operate our business as we otherwise might operate it our failure to comply with any of these covenants or to meet any payment obligations under the facility could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived would result in any amounts outstanding including any accrued interest and unpaid fees becoming immediately due and payable we might not have sufficient working capital or liquidity to satisfy any repayment obligations in the event of an acceleration of those obligations in addition if we are not in compliance with the financial and operating covenants at the time we wish to borrow funds we will be unable to borrow funds 

our stock price has been volatile which may make it harder to resell your shares at a time and at a price that is favorable to you 

market prices for securities of software companies are generally volatile and are subject to significant fluctuations unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies the trading prices and valuations of these stocks and of ours may not be predictable negative changes in the public’s perception of the prospects of software companies or of ptc or the markets we serve could depress our stock price regardless of our operating results 

also a large percentage of our common stock is held by institutional investors purchases and sales of our common stock by these institutional investors could have a significant impact on the market price of the stock for more information about those investors please see our proxy statement with respect to our most recent annual meeting of stockholders and schedules 13d and 13g filed with the sec with respect to our common stock

tableend forwardlooking statements 

statements in this annual report about anticipated financial results and growth as well as about the development of our products and markets are forwardlooking statements that are based on our current plans and assumptions important information about the bases for these plans and assumptions and factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements is contained below and in item 1a “risk factors” of this annual report 

unless otherwise indicated all references to a year reflect our fiscal year that ends on september 30 

executive overview 

we achieved our nongaap earnings per share and nongaap operating margin targets for 2012 on lighter than expected revenue our 2012 nongaap earnings per share grew 20 to 151 per share and our nongaap operating margin was 196 up 190 basis points year over year up 210 basis points on a constant currency basis nongaap revenue was 1258 million up 8 year over year up 10 on a constant currency basis on an organic basis excluding revenue for both 2011 and 2012 from our mks and 4cs businesses acquired in the second half of 2011 revenue increased 3 5 on a constant currency basis our 2012 gaap earnings per share and operating margin results were affected by the recording of a valuation allowance against us net deferred tax assets which resulted in a noncash income tax charge of 124 million and restructuring charges of 25 million resulting in a loss per share of 030 and operating margin of 102 up 20 basis points year over year up 50 basis points on a constant currency basis gaap revenue was 1256 million up 8 year over year up 10 on a constant currency basis nongaap measures are reconciled to gaap results under results of operations  income and margins earnings per share  below 

our revenue results were negatively impacted by uncertainty in the global economy and currency particularly the euro we believe that global economic concerns have impacted customer purchasing decisions causing customers to reduce the size of their purchases andor to delay purchase decisions license revenue was more adversely affected by this trend than were maintenance and service revenues total license revenue for 2012 was 348 million an increase of 2 year over year up 4 on a constant currency basis on an organic basis total license revenue for 2012 was down 3 yearoveryear down 1 on a constant currency basis 

our maintenance and services businesses performed well in 2012 despite the lower than anticipated license revenue we have more than 17 million software seats under maintenance as of the end of 2012 up 13 from the end of 2011 and our services business improved its profitability throughout 2012 we remained committed to meeting our earnings targets through diligent headcount and expense management we ended 2012 with 5897 employees a 4 decline from the end of 2011 due primarily to headcount reductions associated with restructuring actions completed in the second and third quarters of 2012 and 

the completion of our integration of our mks and 4cs acquisitions our operating margin and earnings per share improvements were partially offset by the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates which unfavorably impacted 2012 nongaap and gaap operating margin by approximately 7 million and 6 million respectively 

we ended 2012 with 490 million of cash and 370 million of debt up from 168 million of cash and 200 million of debt at september 30 2011 reflecting 230 million in proceeds drawn from our credit facility to finance the servigistics acquisition which we completed on october 2 2012 operating cash flows were 218 million in 2012 and we used 35 million to repurchase shares of our common stock in 2012 

future expectations strategies and risks 

for 2013 our goal is to achieve revenue growth of 8 to 10 which includes revenue from servigistics including license revenue growth of 6 to 9 maintenance revenue growth of approximately 7 and consulting and training service revenue growth of 12 to 15 and nongaap operating margin expansion of 200 basis points from 196 in 2012 to approximately 215 in 2013 expansion of gaap operating margins from 102 in 2012 to approximately 12 in 2013 if foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar differ significantly from our current assumed rates or if economic conditions deteriorate our results could differ materially from our plans our current plan assumes a 130 usd to euro rate 

we expect to record a restructuring charge of approximately 16 million in the first quarter of 2013 primarily for severance and related costs associated with approximately 170 employees notified of termination during the first quarter representing approximately 3 of our total workforce which total workforce includes approximately 400 employees from servigistics we expect this restructuring will reduce our costs by approximately 5 million per quarter in 2013 while we expect the restructuring to be implemented in the first quarter of 2013 the full impact of the expense reductions will not be realized until the second quarter of 2013 estimated cost savings of this restructuring are included in the 2013 financial targets above 

also our results have been impacted and we expect will continue to be impacted by the presence or absence of large transactions the amount of revenue particularly license revenue attributable to large transactions and the number of such transactions may vary significantly from quarter to quarter based on customer purchasing decisions and macroeconomic conditions our growth rates have become increasingly dependent on adoption of our enterprise solutions among large direct customers such transactions tend to be larger in size and may have long lead times as they often follow a lengthy product selection and evaluation process this may cause volatility in our results 

impact of an investigation in china 

we have been investigating payments and expenses by certain business partners and employees in china that raise questions of compliance with laws including the foreign corrupt practices act andor compliance with our business policies in connection with this matter we have terminated certain employees and business partners in china which may have an adverse impact on our level of sales in china until replacements for those employees and business partners are in place and productive revenue from china has historically represented 6 to 7  of our total revenue we have voluntarily disclosed the results of our investigation and associated remedial actions to the united states department of justice and the securities and exchange commission and are continuing to provide additional information as requested by those agencies with respect to this matter resolution of this matter could include fines or other sanctions but we are unable to estimate an amount if any 

revenue operating margin earnings per share and cash flow 

the following table shows the financial measures that we consider the most significant indicators of the performance of our business in addition to providing operating income operating margin and diluted earnings per share as calculated under generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” it shows nongaap operating income operating margin and diluted earnings per share for the reported periods these nongaap measures exclude a fair value adjustment related to acquired deferred maintenance revenue stockbased compensation expense amortization of acquired intangible assets expense acquisitionrelated charges restructuring charges onetime gains or charges included in nonoperating other income expense and the related tax effects of the preceding items as well as the tax items identified excluding those expenses and items provides investors another view of our operating results that is aligned with management budgets and with performance criteria in our incentive compensation plans management uses and investors should use nongaap measures in conjunction with our gaap results we discuss the nongaap measures in detail under results of operations  income and margins earnings per share  below 

  



  

 

2012 compared to 2011 

revenue in 2012 grew 8 10 on a constant currency basis and license revenue grew 2 4 on a constant currency basis compared to 2011 on an organic basis excluding the 2012 and 2011 revenue from our 2011 mks and 4cs acquisitions our total revenue grew 3 5 on a constant currency basis and our license revenue declined 3 in 2012 compared to 2011 for 2012 our large deal activity license and consulting and training service revenue of more than 1 million recognized from a single customer in a quarter was approximately flat year over year with a lower mix of license revenue in 2012 which we attribute to the uncertain economy and unfavorable currency movements in 2012 as compared to 2011 our enterprise maintenance and consulting services business continued to be strong on both a reported and organic basis 

our desktop license revenue and desktop total revenue declined 10 and 3 respectively in 2012 compared to 2011 attributable to a decrease in the dollar amount of large deals with direct customers our desktop license revenue in 2011 benefited from our launch of ptc creo and renewed demand for cad products which had been soft in 2009 and 2010 our enterprise license revenue and enterprise total revenue grew 17 and 20 respectively in 2012 compared to 2011 excluding the impact of mks and 4cs enterprise license revenue was up 7 and enterprise total revenue was up 10 in the small and 

mediumsize business market we saw continued demand with indirect license revenue and indirect total revenue both up 8 in 2012 compared to 2011 

costs and expenses in 2012 compared to 2011 were impacted by a number of factors including the impact of foreign currency the full year impact of our mks and 4cs acquisitions acquired in the second half of 2011 restructuring charges investments in our direct sales force and a companywide merit pay increase these items are described in more detail in costs and expenses  below 

our gaap and nongaap operating income increased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to increased revenue and operating scale improvements particularly in our services business margins and in research and development during 2012 we also made investments in our sales capacity to capitalize on longterm growth opportunities while nongaap operating income increased significantly in 2012 compared to 2011 gaap operating income improvements were partially offset by restructuring charges recorded in 2012 gaap earnings per share was a loss of 030 in 2012 compared to earnings of 071 in 2011 due primarily to the recording of a valuation allowance against us net deferred tax assets which resulted in a noncash income tax charge of 1245 million and restructuring charges of 25 million nongaap diluted earnings per share grew 20 to 151 in 2012 compared to 2011 due primarily to operating improvements 

cash flow from operating activities was 2180 million in 2012 compared with 787 million in 2011 the increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2012 compared to 2011 was due primarily to the resolution of a litigation matter in 2011 which reduced our cash balance by approximately 48 million in the first quarter of 2011 increased profitability in 2012 and the timing of cash collections on accounts receivable in 2012 accounts receivable was 2174 million and 2302 million at september 30 2012 and 2011 respectively 

2011 compared to 2010 

revenue in 2011 grew 16 12 on a constant currency basis compared to 2010 excluding the impact of acquisitions total revenue was 11401 million up 13 and license revenue was 3317 million up 12 over 2010 we had growth in all lines of business reflecting increased demand for our products and services enterprise maintenance and consulting services revenue increased in 2011 following a strong enterprise license revenue year in 2010 additionally the launch of ptc creo and renewed demand after depressed spending in 2009 and 2010 positively impacted desktop license revenue and maintenance revenue as customers expanded their adoption and renewed seats under maintenance and new customers particularly in the small and mediumsize business space purchased ptc creo 

during 2011 we saw a yearoveryear increase in the amount of revenue from customers for which license andor consulting and training revenue exceeded 1 million in a quarter license andor consulting and training service revenue of 1 million or more recognized from individual customers in a quarter during 2011 totaled 2703 million compared with 2085 million in 2010 

our desktop license revenue and desktop total revenue grew 33 and 15 respectively in 2011 compared to 2010 attributable to an increase in the amount of large deals with direct customers our enterprise license revenue was down slightly year over year following 73 growth from 2009 to 2010 while total enterprise revenue grew 16 in 2011 compared to 2010 excluding the impact of mks and 4cs enterprise license revenue was down 7 year over year and total enterprise revenue was up 10 compared to 2010 enterprise results reflected year over year declines in license revenue in the first half of 2011 and improvement during the second half of fiscal 2011 with fourth quarter year over year license revenue growth of 30 11 when excluding the impact of acquisitions in the small and mediumsize business market indirect license revenue and total indirect revenue were up 23 and 12 respectively in 2011 compared to 2010 

costs and expenses in 2011 increased 12 compared to 2010 and were impacted by a number of factors including higher cost of service in support of services revenue growth investments in our direct sales force incremental headcount costs from acquisitions and a companywide merit pay increase these items are described in more detail in costs and expenses  below 

our gaap and nongaap operating income increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to increased revenue and operating scale improvements particularly in research and development during 2011 we also made measured investments in sales capacity to capitalize on longterm growth opportunities while operating income increased significantly in 2011 compared to 2010 gaap diluted earnings per share increased 248 in 2011 compared to 2010 due to a significantly higher income tax rate in 2010 and improved profitability our tax rate was 18 in 2011 compared with 70 in 2010 due in part to the tax items described in footnote 2 in the table above nongaap diluted earnings per share grew 26 in 2011 compared to 2010 

cash flow from operating activities was 787 million in 2011 compared with 1566 million in 2010 the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the resolution of a litigation matter which reduced our cash balance by approximately 48 million in the first quarter of 2011 and the timing of cash collections on accounts receivable accounts receivable was 2302 million and 1693 million at september 30 2011 and 2010 respectively this increase in accounts receivable was due primarily to revenue in the fourth quarter of 2011 being 714 million higher than the fourth quarter of 2010 

results of operations 

acquisitions 

we acquired mks a global application lifecycle management alm technology leader on may 31 2011 we acquired 4c solutions inc 4cs a developer of warranty management and service lifecycle management slm software in september 2011 

the results of operations of these businesses have been included in ptc’s consolidated financial statements beginning on their respective acquisition dates these acquisitions added 815 million to our 2012 revenue 840 million on a nongaap basis compared to 268 million to our 2011 revenue 294 million on a nongaap basis mks and 4cs revenue is classified as “enterprise” revenue 

impact of foreign currency exchange on results of operations 

approximately two thirds of our revenue and half of our expenses are transacted in currencies other than the us dollar currency translation affects our reported results because we report our results of operations in us dollars changes in currency exchange rates in 2012 compared to 2011 particularly for the euro reduced both revenue and expenses conversely in 2011 and 2010 our revenue and expenses increased as a result of changes in currency rates if actual reported results were converted into us dollars based on the corresponding prior year’s foreign currency exchange rates 2012 revenue and expenses would have been higher by 252 million and 192 million respectively 2011 and 2010 revenue would have been lower by 368 million and 155 million respectively and 2011 and 2010 expenses would have been lower by 210 million and 115 million respectively the net impact on yearoveryear results would have been an increase in operating income of 60 million in 2012 and a decrease in operating income of 158 million and 40 million in 2011 and 2010 respectively the results of operations revenue by line of business and revenue by geographic region in the tables that follow present both actual percentage changes year over year and percentage changes on a constant currency basis

revenue by line of business 

  



  



license revenue 

2012 compared to 2011 

license revenue of 3484 million in 2012 increased 63 million from 2011 primarily due to a 158 million increase in license revenue from our mks and 4cs businesses acquired in the second half of 2011 262 million in 2012 and 104 million in 2011 partially offset by unfavorable currency movements from a geographic standpoint license revenue increases in the pacific rim of 22 140 million and japan of 5 14 million were partially offset by a decrease in europe of 7 84 million americas license revenue was flat in 2012 compared to 2011 

  

enterprise license revenue primarily plm license sales while negatively impacted by our performance in europe grew 17 259 million in 2012 compared to 2011 due to the increased license revenue contribution from mks and 4cs and sales of ptc windchill which were 19 183 million higher desktop license revenue primarily ptc creo license sales declined 10 in 2012 compared to 2011 due to a decline in ptc creo license sales in 2012 after the strong year in 2011 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced license revenue by 65 million in 2012 compared to 2011 

2011 compared to 2010 

the increase in overall license revenue in 2011 compared to 2010 was due primarily to growth in direct desktop revenue from sales to our large commercial customers additionally license revenue from small and mediumsize customers increased with increases in both indirect desktop and enterprise license revenue we attribute the increase in desktop license sales to the launch of ptc creo in 2011 and a rebound in demand for cad products after reduced customer spending in 2009 and 2010 which resulted in orders from our existing customer base and an increase in sales to new customers in our reseller channel 

mks which was acquired in may 2011 contributed 104 million to enterprise license revenue in 2011 excluding mks enterprise license revenue in 2011 was down 7 year over year reflecting declines in the first half of 2011 we saw improvements in enterprise license revenue in the second half of 2011 with yearoveryear growth in the fourth quarter of 30 11 when excluding the impact of acquisitions enterprise license revenue results reflected decreases in revenue from sales of ptc windchill which were 19 226 million lower in 2011 compared to 2010 some of this decline was due to the fact that 2010 was a particularly strong comparison period that included several large ptc windchill transactions with 73 growth in enterprise license revenue in 2010 compared to 2009 in addition we believe that one of the primary factors that adversely impacted the enterprise license revenue performance in 2011 was that increased desktop revenue opportunities occupied a greater proportion of our sales capacity with a corresponding decrease in focus on enterprise sales as a result we began expanding our sales capacity in the second half of 2011 to ensure sufficient capacity for a breadth of opportunities 

foreign currency exchange rate movements increased license revenue by 114 million in 2011 compared to 2010

2011 compared to 2010

revenue from individual customers

revenue from large customers in 2012 compared to 2011 reflects continued growth in enterprise consulting projects a slight decline in enterprise license revenue and a decline in desktop license revenue resulting in a lower overall mix of license revenue the license revenue portion of this metric which typically comprises 50 to 60 of the total was 44 in 2012 compared to 52 in 2011 and 58 in 2010 the 2012 decline in desktop license revenue is due to a particularly strong comparison period in 2011 due in part to our launch of ptc creo in 2011 revenue from large customers in 2011 compared to 2010 reflects increased revenue from desktop licenses mainly ptc creo and enterprise services partially offset by lower sales of enterprise licenses

interest income 

interest income represents earnings on the investment of our available cash balances the decrease in interest income in 2012 compared to 2011 was due primarily to lower interest rates the increase in interest income in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to higher interest rates resulting in more interest earned on cash balances 

interest expense 

interest expense is primarily related to interest on borrowings under our credit facility the increase in interest expense in 2012 compared to 2011 is primarily due to higher amounts outstanding under our credit facility we borrowed 250 million in may 2011 in connection with our acquisition of mks and repaid 50 million of such amount in 2011 and 60 million in 2012 as of september 30 2012 we had 370 million outstanding under our credit facility including 230 million in proceeds drawn from our credit facility in the fourth quarter of 2012 to finance the servigistics acquisition which closed on october 2 2012 compared to 200 million outstanding at september 30 2011 

the increase in interest expense in 2011 compared to 2010 is due to higher average amounts outstanding and higher interest rates 

the average interest rate on amounts outstanding under the credit facility was 18 in 2012 21 in 2011 and 16 in 2010 

income taxes 

our effective income tax rate has fluctuated significantly in each of the past three years in 2012 this was the result of establishing a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets in the us in 2010 this was due primarily to the impact of discrete events described further below which created a onetime income tax provision in 2010   



in 2012 our effective tax rate was higher than the 35 statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to the recording of a 1245 million charge to the income tax provision related to the establishment of a valuation allowance on us net deferred tax assets as described below this increase was offset in part as a result of our corporate structure in which our foreign taxes are at a net effective tax rate lower than the us rate our 2012 provision included a noncash charge of 42 million related to the restructuring of our canadian operations that resulted in a change in the tax status of the foreign legal entity and a noncash charge of 14 million related to the impact of a japanese legislative change on our japan entitys deferred tax assets these charges were excluded from our nongaap earnings per share see income and margins earnings per share  below additionally our 2012 tax provision reflects a 78 million provision related to a research and development cost sharing prepayment by a foreign subsidiary to the us a comparable prepayment was made in 2011 in 2012 we recorded a 20 million  correction to deferred tax benefits on unrecognized actuarial losses related to pension benefits which was not material to the current or prior periods 

in 2011 our effective tax rate was lower than the 35 statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to our corporate structure in which our foreign taxes are at a net effective tax rate lower than the us rate and a 23 million tax benefit related to research and development rd triggered by a retroactive extension of the rd tax credit enacted in the first quarter of 2011 our 2011 tax provision reflects a 75 million provision related to a research and development cost sharing prepayment by a foreign subsidiary to the us a similar prepayment was made in 2010 resulting in a 60 million provision in that year as a result the net increase to the 2011 provision was 15 million 

in 2011 we continued the reorganization of our legal entity structure which began in 2010 to support our tax and cash planning the 2011 reorganization resulted in a 464 million taxable gain in the us the tax on this gain was offset in part by the reversal of a deferred tax liability for unremitted earnings of a foreign subsidiary of 65 million established in 2010 in contemplation of this transaction the recognition of foreign tax credits previously not benefitted and foreign tax credits generated as a result of the transaction 

in 2010 our effective income tax rate differed from the 35 statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a onetime tax charge of 434 million recorded as a result of a business reorganization partially offset by foreign taxes at a net effective income tax rate lower than the us rate during the fourth quarter of 2010 we undertook a reorganization of our legal entity structure to support our tax and cash planning the objective of this reorganization was to enable significant redeployment and 

repatriation of cash between our international and domestic operations this reorganization resulted in 446 million of foreign source taxable gain in the us which was offset by foreign tax credits primarily generated as a result of this transaction and carry forward credits available a significant amount of these carry forward credits was previously unrecognized due to the uncertainty of generating foreign source income in the us the net tax effect of this reorganization was a 434 million tax provision in the us while this reorganization resulted in a onetime increase in our tax rate of 53 it had no material effect on cash taxes paid and as a result was excluded from our nongaap earnings per share see income and margins earnings per share  below our 2010 tax provision reflects a 60 million provision related to a research and development rd cost sharing prepayment by a foreign subsidiary to the us this prepayment had no impact on our 2010 tax rate as the same prepayment was made in 2009 additionally we established a full valuation allowance on foreign tax credits not expected to be realized 

in the fourth quarter of 2012 we recorded a 1245 million  noncash charge to the income tax provision to establish a valuation allowance against all of our us deferred tax assets which were net of approximately 28 million of us deferred tax liabilities the accounting guidance for income taxes requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if based on the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than 50 percent that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the realization of deferred tax assets including carryforwards and deductible temporary differences depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the same character during the carryback or carryforward period we consider all sources of taxable income available to realize the deferred tax assets including the future reversal of existing temporary differences future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards taxable income in prior carryback years and taxplanning strategies 

in making a determination whether to record a valuation allowance we weighed all available evidence both positive and negative including our cumulative profitability on a pretax basis for the last three years and our estimate of future pretax results on a pretax basis adjusted for permanent differences for the three years ended september 30 2012 we have cumulative us profits including the tax effect of legal entity reorganizations in 2010 and 2011 described above however based on our fiscal 2013 plan completed in the fourth quarter of 2012 we now estimate that the us will generate a taxable loss in 2013 sufficient to result in cumulative three year losses by the end of 2013 our 2012 results and our forecast for 2013 have not shown the improvement to us earnings previously forecast although we anticipate continued improvement in us core earnings the turnaround to operating profitability is not anticipated in the near term we had also anticipated that we would execute a legal entity reorganization of a foreign subsidiary that would generate sufficient us taxable income to result in cumulative us profits through at least 2013 we have now determined that this tax planning strategy is not feasible as a result we do not expect to generate sufficient us taxable income in the near future to realize our us net deferred tax assets 

in the first quarter of 2013 our acquisition of servigistics inc will be accounted for as a business combination assets acquired including the fair values of acquired intangible assets and liabilities assumed will be recorded in purchase accounting in conjunction with recording the finitelived acquired intangible assets we anticipate that we will be recording deferred tax liabilities equal to the tax effect of the acquired intangible assets that are not deductible for income tax purposes we anticipate that in purchase accounting servigistics will be in a us net deferred tax liability position which will result in an adjustment to decrease our valuation allowance on us net deferred tax assets as this decrease in the valuation allowance is not part of the purchase accounting for servigistics the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed it will be recorded as an income tax benefit we expect our tax provision in the first quarter of 2013 to be an income tax benefit net due to the release of a significant portion of the valuation allowance on us net deferred tax assets as a result of purchase accounting for servigistics 

in the normal course of business ptc and its subsidiaries are examined by various taxing authorities including the internal revenue service irs in the united states we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate we are currently under audit by tax authorities in several foreign jurisdictions audits by tax authorities typically involve examination of the deductibility of certain permanent items limitations on net operating losses and tax credits although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in material changes in our estimates 

our future effective income tax rate may be materially impacted by the amount of income taxes associated with our foreign earnings which are taxed at rates different from the us federal statutory income tax rate as well as the timing and extent of the realization of deferred tax assets and changes in the tax law further our tax rate may fluctuate within a fiscal year including from quarter to quarter due to items arising from discrete events including settlements of tax audits and assessments the resolution or identification of tax position uncertainties and acquisitions of other companies 

income and margins earnings per share nongaap measures 

as shown in the table below our gaap and nongaap operating income and operating margins have shown yearoveryear improvements in both 2012 and 2011 primarily due to margin contribution associated with higher revenue described in revenue  above partially offset by higher costs and expenses described in costs and expenses  above 

the nongaap measures presented in the foregoing discussion of our results of operations and the respective most directly comparable gaap measures are 

 the nongaap measures exclude a fair value adjustment related to acquired mks deferred maintenance revenue stockbased compensation expense amortization of acquired intangible assets expense acquisitionrelated charges restructuring charges onetime gains or charges included in nonoperating other income expense and the related tax effects of the preceding items and the tax items identified these items are normally included in the comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 

fair value of acquired mks deferred maintenance revenue  is a purchase accounting adjustment recorded to reduce acquired deferred maintenance revenue to the fair value of the remaining obligation 

stockbased compensation expense  is noncash expense relating to stockbased awards issued to executive officers employees and outside directors consisting of restricted stock stock options and restricted stock units 

amortization of acquired intangible assets expense  is a noncash expense that is impacted by the timing and magnitude of our acquisitions we believe the assessment of our operations excluding these costs is relevant to our assessment of internal operations and comparisons to the performance of other companies in our industry 

acquisitionrelated charges  are costs that are included in general and administrative expenses and include direct costs of acquisitions and expenses related to acquisition integration activities including transaction fees due diligence costs and severance and professional fees including legal and accounting costs related to the acquisition these costs are not considered part of our normal operations as the occurrence and amount will vary depending on the timing and size of acquisitions and the level of integration activity undertaken 

restructuring charges  include excess facility and assetrelated restructuring charges and severance costs resulting from reductions of personnel driven by modifications to our business strategy and not as part of our normal operations these costs may vary in size based on our restructuring plan in addition we regularly reevaluate our assumptions which may increase or reduce the charges in a specific period 

we use these nongaap measures and we believe that they assist our investors to make periodtoperiod comparisons of our operational performance because they provide a view of our operating results without items that are not in our view indicative of our core operating results we believe that these nongaap measures help illustrate underlying trends in our business and we use the measures to establish budgets and operational goals communicated internally and externally for managing our business and evaluating our performance we believe that providing nongaap measures affords investors a view of our operating results that may be more easily compared to the results of peer companies in addition compensation of our executives is based in part on the performance of our business based on these nongaap measures 

the items excluded from the nongaap measures often have a material impact on our financial results and such items often recur accordingly the nongaap measures included in this annual report should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for or superior to the comparable measures prepared in accordance with gaap 

the following tables reconcile each of these nongaap measures to its most closely comparable gaap measure on our financial statements

equivalent to approximately 305 million when the contracts were entered into we entered into these forward contracts to reduce our foreign currency exposure related to changes in the canadian to us dollar exchange rate from the time we entered into the agreement in early april to acquire mks the purchase price is in canadian dollars and the closing date which was may 31 2011 we realized foreign currency losses of 44 million in the third quarter of 2011 recorded as other expense related to the acquisition of mks in the first quarter of 2011 we recorded 07 million of foreign currency losses related to a litigation settlement in japan 

 critical accounting policies and estimates 

we have prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america in preparing our financial statements we make estimates assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our reported revenues results of operations and net income as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet these estimates assumptions and judgments are necessary because future events and their effects on our results and the value of our assets cannot be determined with certainty and are made based on our historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances these estimates may change as new events occur or additional information is obtained and we may periodically be faced with uncertainties the outcomes of which are not within our control and may not be known for a prolonged period of time 

the accounting policies methods and estimates used to prepare our financial statements are described generally in note b of “notes to consolidated financial statements” the most important accounting judgments and estimates that we made in preparing the financial statements involved 

 a critical accounting policy is one that is both material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires us to make difficult subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate and different estimates that we could have used or changes in the estimates that are reasonably likely to occur may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process actual results could differ from those estimates 

accounting policies guidelines and interpretations related to our critical accounting policies and estimates are generally subject to numerous sources of authoritative guidance and are often reexamined by accounting standards rule makers and regulators these rule makers andor regulators may promulgate interpretations guidance or regulations that may result in changes to our accounting policies which could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 

revenue recognition 

we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with determining the amounts of software license and services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period 

our primary judgments involve the following 

 we derive revenues from three primary sources 1 software licenses 2 maintenance services and 3 consulting and training services revenue by type for 2012 2011 and 2010 was as follows 

  



w recognize revenue when 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 2 delivery has occurred generally fob shipping point or electronic distribution 3 the fee is fixed or determinable and 4 collection is probable 

our software is distributed primarily through our direct sales force in addition we have an indirect distribution channel through alliances with resellers revenue arrangements with resellers are recognized on a sellthrough basis that is when we deliver the product to the enduser customer we record consideration given to a reseller as a reduction of revenue to the extent we have recorded revenue from the reseller we do not offer contractual rights of return stock balancing or price protection to our resellers and actual product returns from them have been insignificant to date as a result we do not maintain reserves for reseller product returns 

at the time of each sale transaction we must make an assessment of the collectability of the amount due from the customer revenue is only recognized at that time if management deems that collection is probable in making this assessment we consider customer creditworthiness and historical payment experience at that same time we assess whether fees are fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties in assessing whether the fee is fixed or determinable we consider the payment terms of the transaction including transactions with payment terms that extend beyond our customary payment terms and our collection experience in similar transactions without making concessions among other factors we have periodically provided financing to creditworthy customers with payment terms up to 24 months if the fee is determined not to be fixed or determinable revenue is recognized only as payments become due from the customer provided that all 

other revenue recognition criteria are met our software license arrangements generally do not include customer acceptance provisions however if an arrangement includes an acceptance provision we record revenue only upon the earlier of 1 receipt of written acceptance from the customer or 2 expiration of the acceptance period 

our software arrangements often include implementation and consulting services that are sold under consulting engagement contracts or as part of the software license arrangement when we determine that such services are not essential to the functionality of the licensed software we record revenue separately for the license and service elements of these arrangements provided that appropriate evidence of fair value exists for the undelivered services see discussion below generally we consider that a service is not essential to the functionality of the software based on various factors including if the services may be provided by independent third parties experienced in providing such consulting and implementation in coordination with dedicated customer personnel and whether the services result in significant modification or customization of the software functionality when consulting services qualify for separate accounting consulting revenues under time and materials billing arrangements are recognized as the services are performed consulting revenues under fixedpriced contracts are generally recognized as the services are performed using a proportionate performance model with hours or costs as the input method of attribution when we provide consulting services considered essential to the functionality of the software the arrangement does not qualify for separate accounting of the license and service elements and the license revenue is recognized together with the consulting services using the percentageofcompletion method of contract accounting under such 

arrangements consideration is recognized as the services are performed as measured by an observable input in these circumstances we separate license revenue from service revenue for income statement presentation by allocating vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value of the consulting services as service revenue and the residual portion as license revenue under the percentageofcompletion method we estimate the stage of completion of contracts with fixed or “not to exceed” fees based on hours or costs incurred to date as compared with estimated total project hours or costs at completion adjustments to estimates to complete are made in the periods in which facts resulting in a change become known when total cost estimates exceed revenues we accrue for the estimated losses when identified the use of the proportionate performance and percentageofcompletion methods of accounting require significant judgment relative to estimating total contract costs or hours hours being a proxy for costs including assumptions relative to the length of time to complete the project the nature and complexity of the work to be performed and anticipated changes in salaries and other costs 

we generally use the residual method to recognize revenue from software arrangements that include one or more elements to be delivered at a future date when evidence of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists and the elements of the arrangement qualify for separate accounting as described above under the residual method the fair value of the undelivered elements ie maintenance consulting and training services based on vsoe is deferred and the remaining portion of the total arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements ie software license if evidence of the fair value of one or more of the undelivered services does not exist all revenues are deferred and recognized when delivery of all of those services has occurred or when fair values can be established we determine vsoe of the fair value of services revenue based upon our recent pricing for those services when sold separately for certain transactions vsoe of the fair value of maintenance services is determined based on a substantive maintenance renewal clause within a customer contract our current pricing practices are influenced primarily by product type purchase volume sales channel and customer location we review services sold separately on a periodic basis and update when appropriate our vsoe of fair value for such services to ensure that it reflects our recent pricing experience 

generally our contracts are accounted for individually however when contracts are closely interrelated and dependent on each other it may be necessary to account for two or more contracts as one to reflect the substance of the group of contracts 

for subscriptionbased licenses license revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement in limited circumstances where the right to use the software license is contingent upon current payments of maintenance fees for software license and maintenance are recognized ratably over the initial maintenance term 

maintenance services generally include rights to unspecified upgrades when and if available telephone and internetbased support updates and bug fixes maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract on a straightline basis 

reimbursements of outofpocket expenditures incurred in connection with providing consulting services are included in services revenue with the offsetting expense recorded in cost of service revenue 

training services include onsite and classroom training training revenues are recognized as the related training services are provided 

accounting for income taxes 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to calculate our income tax expense based on taxable income by jurisdiction there are many transactions and calculations about which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain as a result our calculations involve estimates by management some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenuesharing costreimbursement and transfer pricing arrangements among related entities and the differing tax treatment of revenue and cost items across various jurisdictions if we were compelled to revise or to account differently for our arrangements that revision could affect our tax liability 

the income tax accounting process also involves estimating our actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheets we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized we must establish a valuation allowance as a charge to income tax expense 

as of september 30 2012 we have a valuation allowance of 1471 million against net deferred tax assets in the us and a remaining valuation allowance of 233 million against net deferred tax assets in certain foreign jurisdictions in the fourth quarter of 2012 we recorded a 1245 million  noncash charge to the income tax provision related to the establishment of a valuation allowance against all of our us net deferred tax assets the accounting guidance for income taxes requires that 

deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if based on the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than 50 percent that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the realization of deferred tax assets including carryforwards and deductible temporary differences depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the same character during the carryback or carryforward period we consider all sources of taxable income available to realize the deferred tax assets including the future reversal of existing temporary differences future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards taxable income in prior carryback years and taxplanning strategies 

in making a determination whether to record a valuation allowance we weighed all available evidence both positive and negative including our cumulative profitability on a pretax basis for the last three years and our estimate of future pretax results on a pretax basis adjusted for permanent differences for the three years ended september 30 2012 we have cumulative us profits including the tax effect of legal entity reorganizations in 2010 and 2011 however based on our fiscal 2013 plan completed in the fourth quarter of 2012 we now estimate that the us will generate a taxable loss in 2013 sufficient to result in cumulative three year losses by the end of 2013 our 2012 results and our forecast for 2013 have not shown the improvement to us earnings previously forecast although we anticipate continued improvement in us core earnings the turnaround to operating profitability is not anticipated in the near term additionally we anticipated that we would execute a legal entity reorganization of a foreign subsidiary that would generate sufficient us taxable income to result in cumulative us profits through at least 2013 we have now determined that this tax planning strategy is not feasible as a result we do not expect to generate sufficient us taxable income in the near future to realize our us net deferred tax assets 

the valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets of certain foreign jurisdictions is established primarily for our net operating loss carryforwards the majority of which do not expire there are limitations imposed on the utilization of such net operating losses that could further restrict the recognition of any tax benefits 

in the normal course of business ptc and its subsidiaries are examined by various taxing authorities including the internal revenue service irs in the united states we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate we are currently under audit by tax authorities in several foreign jurisdictions audits by tax authorities typically involve examination of the deductibility of certain permanent items limitations on net operating losses and tax credits although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in material changes in our estimates 

valuation of assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations 

in accordance with business combination accounting we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values determining these fair values requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets 

our identifiable intangible assets acquired consist of developed technology core technology tradenames customer lists and contracts and software support agreements and related relationships developed technology consists of products that have reached technological feasibility core technology represents a combination of processes inventions and trade secrets related to the design and development of acquired products customer lists and contracts and software support agreements and related relationships represent the underlying relationships and agreements with customers of the acquired company’s installed base we have generally valued intangible assets using a discounted cash flow model critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to 

 in addition we estimate the useful lives of our intangible assets based upon the expected period over which we anticipate generating economic benefits from the related intangible asset 

net tangible assets consist of the fair values of tangible assets less the fair values of assumed liabilities and obligations except for deferred revenues net tangible assets were generally valued by us at the respective carrying amounts recorded by the acquired company as we believed that their carrying values approximated their fair values at the acquisition date 

the values assigned to deferred revenue reflect an amount equivalent to the estimated cost plus an appropriate profit margin to perform the services related to the acquired company’s software support contracts 

in addition uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date and we reevaluate these items quarterly with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill provided that we are within the measurement period up to one year from the acquisition date and we continue to collect information in order to determine their estimated values subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the estimated value of uncertain tax positions or tax related valuation allowances whichever comes first changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations 

our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable at that time but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions estimates or actual results 

when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a finitelived intangible asset may not be recoverable we perform an assessment of the asset for potential impairment this assessment is based on projected undiscounted future cash flows over the asset’s remaining life if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its undiscounted cash flows we record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset determined using projected discounted future cash flows of the asset 

valuation of goodwill 

our goodwill totaled 6103 million and 6134 million as of september 30 2012 and 2011 respectively we have two operating segments 1 software products and 2 services we assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level our reporting units are determined based on the components of our operating segments that constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and for which operating results are regularly reviewed by segment management our reporting units are consistent with our operating segments as of september 30 2012 and 2011 goodwill and acquired intangible assets in the aggregate attributable to our software products reportable segment was 7681 million  and 8060 million  respectively and attributable to our services reportable segment was 281 million  and 294 million  respectively we test goodwill for impairment in the third quarter of our fiscal year or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting segment below its carrying value factors we consider important on an overall company basis and reportable segment basis as applicable that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results significant changes in our use of the acquired assets or a significant change in the strategy for our business significant negative industry or economic trends a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period or a reduction of our market capitalization relative to net book value 

 our 2012 goodwill impairment assessment was based on the new guidance prescribed in asu 20118 on july 2 2011 the estimated fair value of each reporting unit was approximately double its carrying value or higher because our fair value was well in excess of our carrying value on that date and there were no other indicators that our goodwill had become impaired since that date we elected to perform a qualitative assessment to test each reporting unit’s goodwill for impairment based on our qualitative assessment if we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not ie a likelihood of more than 50 percent to be greater than its carrying amount no additional testing will be performed if we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not to be less than its carrying amount the two step impairment test will be performed in the first step we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform further testing if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill if the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference 

we completed our annual goodwill impairment review as of june 30 2012  based on a qualitative assessment our qualitative assessment included company specific financial performance and longrange plans industry and macroeconomic factors as well as a sensitivity analysis of key model assumptions based on our qualitative assessment we concluded it was morelikelythannot that the fair values of our reporting units exceed their carrying values and that no further impairment testing was required 

accounting for pensions 

we sponsor several us and international pension plans we make assumptions that are used in calculating the expense and liability of these plans these key assumptions include the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate in selecting the expected longterm rate of return on assets we consider the average future rate of earnings expected on the funds invested to provide for the benefits under the pension plan this includes considering the plans asset allocations and the expected returns likely to be earned over the life of the plans the discount rate reflects the estimated rate at which an amount that is invested in a portfolio of highquality debt instruments would provide the future cash flows necessary to pay benefits when they come due the actuarial assumptions used by us may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions or longer or shorter life spans of the participants our actual results could differ materially from those we estimated which could require us to record a greater amount of pension expense in future years andor require higher than expected cash contributions 

in the us we sponsor a frozen pension plan covering mostly inactive participants the us discount rate is determined using a bondmatching tool under this tool discount rates are derived by identifying a theoretical settlement portfolio of high quality bonds sufficient to provide for the pension plans projected benefit payments a single rate is then determined that results in a discounted value of the plans benefit payments that equates to the market value of the selected bonds    in determining our us pension cost for 2012 2011 and 2010 we used a discount rate of 450  500  and 550  respectively and an expected return on plan assets of 725 for 2012 and 2011 and 750 for 2010 

certain of our international subsidiaries principally germany also sponsor pension plans accounting and reporting for these plans requires the use of countryspecific assumptions for discount rates and expected rates of return on assets we apply a consistent methodology in determining the key assumptions that in addition to future experience assumptions such as mortality rates are used by our actuaries to determine our liability and expense for each of these plans the discount rate for germany was selected with reference to a spotrate yield curve based on the yields of aarated eurodenominated corporate bonds in addition our actuarial consultants determine the expense and liabilities of the plan using other assumptions for future experience such as mortality rates in determining our pension cost for 2012 2011 and 2010 we used weighted average discount rates of 48  40  and 51  respectively and weighted average expected returns on plan assets of 54  56  and 61   respectively 

in 2012 and 2010 our actual return on plan assets in total for all plans was a gain of 165 million  and 77 million respectively while in 2011 our actual return on plan assets was a loss of 16 million  continued distress in global financial markets has caused among other things extreme volatility in security prices severely diminished liquidity and credit availability rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuation of others if actual returns are below our expected rates of return it will impact the amount and timing of future contributions and expense for these plans 

as of september 30 2012 and 2011 our plans in total were underfunded representing the difference between our projected benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets by 763 million  and 682 million  respectively the projected benefit obligation as of september 30 2012 was determined using a discount rate of 40  for the us plan and a weighted average discount rate of 34  for our international plans the most sensitive assumptions used in calculating the expense and liability of our pension plans are the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets total net periodic pension cost was 59 million in 2012 and we expect it to be approximately 5 million  in 2013 a 50 basis point change to our discount rate and expected return on plan assets assumptions would have changed our pension expense for the year ended september 30 2012 by approximately 1 million a 50 basis point decrease in our discount rate assumptions would increase our projected benefit obligation as of september 30 2012 by approximately 15 million 

legal contingencies 

we are periodically subject to various legal claims and involved in various legal proceedings we routinely review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any matter is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we record a liability for the estimated loss significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether the amount of an exposure is reasonably estimable because of inherent uncertainties related to these legal matters we base our loss accruals on the best information available at the time further estimates of this nature are highly subjective and the final outcome of these matters could vary significantly from the amounts that have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as additional information becomes available we reassess our potential liability and may revise our estimates such revisions could have a material impact on future quarterly or annual results of operations 

liquidity and capital resources 

  



we invest our cash with highly rated financial institutions and in diversified domestic and international money market mutual funds the portfolio is invested in shortterm instruments to ensure cash is available to meet requirements as needed cash and cash equivalents at september 30 2012 reflects 230 million borrowed under our credit facility in the fourth quarter of 2012 to finance our acquisition of servigistics which closed on october 2 2012 for approximately 220 million 

cash provided by operating activities 

2012 compared to 2011 

the increase in cash provided by operating activities was due to collections on accounts receivables which had a favorable impact of 646 million in 2012 compared to 2011 and improved profitability nongaap operating income for 2012 was 2468 million compared to 2066 million in 2011 partially offset by restructuring payments of 21 million additionally the resolution of a legal matter reduced our cash balance by 48 million in 2011 

cash collections on accounts receivable remained strong with days sales outstanding of 61 days as of september 30 2012 compared to 62 days as of september 30 2011 

we periodically provide financing to creditworthy customers with payment terms up to 24 months other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets include noncurrent receivables from customers related to extended payment term contracts totaling 130 million and 160 million at september 30 2012 and 2011 respectively 

2011 compared to 2010 

the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to the resolution of a litigation matter in japan which reduced our cash balance by a net amount of approximately 48 million in the first quarter of 2011 and the timing of cash collections on accounts receivable described below in addition in 2011 net cash outflows related to compensation accruals were higher than 2010 due primarily to our full achievement of performancebased and incentive cash plan targets in 2010 paid in 2011 while such targets were only partially achieved in 2009 paid in 2010 

accounts receivable was 2302 million and 1693 million at september 30 2011 and 2010 respectively the increase in accounts receivable at the end of 2011 as compared to 2010 was due primarily to revenue in the fourth quarter of 2011 being 713 million higher than in the fourth quarter of 2010 

cash paid for income taxes was  530 million  281 million and 343 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

cash used by investing activities 

  



in 2011 we acquired mks for an aggregate purchase price of 298 million 2652 million net of cash acquired we also acquired 4cs in 2011 our expenditures for property and equipment consist primarily of computer equipment software office equipment and facility improvements 

cash provided used by financing activities 

  



in the fourth quarter of 2012 we borrowed 230 million under our credit facility to finance our acquisition of servigistics proceeds from issuance of common stock reflects stock option exercises stock option exercises totaled 23 million in 2012 compared to 19 million in 2011 and 15 million in 2010 as of september 30 2012 we had approximately 06 million stock options outstanding with gross exercise prices totaling 59 million as a result in 2013 proceeds from stock option exercises will be significantly lower 

share repurchase authorization 

our board of directors has periodically authorized us to repurchase shares of our common stock under our current authorization they have authorized us to repurchase up to 100 million worth of shares with cash from operations in the period october 1 2012 through september 30 2013 in 2012  we repurchased 16 million  shares at a cost of 350 million  in 2011 and 2010 we repurchased 26 million shares at a cost of 549 million and 37 million shares at a cost of 625 million respectively all shares of our common stock repurchased are automatically restored to the status of authorized and unissued future repurchases of shares will reduce our cash balances 

credit facility 

in august 2012 we entered into a multicurrency credit facility the credit facility with a syndicate of ten banks for which jpmorgan chase bank na acts as administrative agent the credit facility replaced a revolving credit facility with the same banks the previous credit facility entered into in august 2010 we expect to use the credit facility for general corporate purposes including acquisitions of businesses and working capital requirements the new credit facility consists of a 150 million term loan and a 300 million revolving loan commitment and may be increased by an additional 150 million in the form of revolving loans or term loans or a combination thereof if the existing or additional lenders are willing to make such increased commitments the revolving loan commitment does not require amortization of principal the term loan requires repayment of principal at the end of each calendar quarter beginning with the quarter ending december 31 2012 the revolving loan and term loan may be repaid in whole or in part prior to the scheduled maturity dates at ptcs option without penalty or premium the credit facility matures on august 16 2017 when all remaining amounts outstanding will be due and payable in full we are required to make principal payments under the term loan of 75 million 150 million 150 million 225 million and 900 million in 2013 2014 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively 

as of september 30 2012 the balance outstanding under the credit facility was 370 million including 230 million borrowed in connection with our acquisition of servigistics in september 2012 as of september 30 2011 we had a 200 million revolving loan outstanding under the previous credit facility which was the remaining balance of the 250 million borrowed in 2011 in connection with our acquisition of mks in 2010 we repaid revolving credit facility borrowings of 51 million which was the remaining balance of 220 million we had borrowed in 2008 in connection with our acquisition of cocreate 

the credit facility limits ptcs and its subsidiaries ability to among other things incur additional indebtedness incur liens or guarantee obligations pay dividends other than to ptc and make other distributions make investments and enter into joint ventures dispose of assets and engage in transactions with affiliates except on an armslength basis under the credit facility ptc and its material domestic subsidiaries may not invest cash or property in or loan to ptcs foreign subsidiaries in aggregate amounts exceeding 50 million for any purpose and an additional 75 million for acquisitions of businesses in addition under the credit facility ptc and its subsidiaries must maintain the following financial ratios 

 

 

as of september 30 2012 our leverage ratio was 140 to 100 and our fixed charge coverage ratio was 6053 

to 100 we were in compliance with all financial and operating covenants of the credit facility as of 

september 30 2012 

for a description of additional terms and conditions of the credit facility including limitations on our ability to undertake certain actions see note h debt in the “notes to consolidated financial statements” of this annual report 

expectations for fiscal 2013 

we believe that existing cash and cash equivalents together with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements through at least the next twelve months and to meet our known longterm capital requirements in addition we expect to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in 2013 to repay 120 million to 160 million outstanding under our credit facility and to repurchase between 55 million and 75 million worth of shares of our common stock capital expenditures in 2013 are currently anticipated to be approximately 28 million 

on october 2 2012 we closed our acquisition of servigistics for approximately 220 million in cash we financed the acquisition with borrowings under our credit facility we have evaluated and expect to continue to evaluate possible strategic transactions on an ongoing basis and at any given time may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to possible strategic transactions our expected uses of cash could change our cash position could be reduced and we may incur additional debt obligations to the extent we complete any significant acquisitions 

at september 30 2012 we had cash and cash equivalents of 2958 million in the united states including 230 million borrowed under our credit facility in contemplation of our acquisition of servigistics 811 million in europe 756 million in the pacific rim including india 196 million in japan and 174 million in other nonus countries as of september 30 2012 we had an outstanding intercompany loan receivable of 2807 million primarily resulting from our business reorganizations described in note g income taxes  in the “notes to consolidated financial statements” of this annual report owed to the us from our top tier foreign subsidiary this amount can be repaid with cash generated by our foreign subsidiaries and repatriated to the us without future tax cost 

contractual obligations 

at september 30 2012 our contractual obligations were as follows 

  



  

 38 

use software and hardware and other marketing and consulting contracts contracts for which our commitment is variable based on volumes with no fixed minimum quantities and contracts that can be canceled without payment penalties have been excluded the purchase obligations included above are in addition to amounts included in current liabilities and prepaid expenses recorded on our september 30 2012 consolidated balance sheet 

 as of september 30 2012 we had letters of credit and bank guarantees outstanding of approximately 37 million  of which 12 million  was collateralized primarily related to our corporate headquarters lease in needham massachusetts 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have not created and are not party to any specialpurpose or offbalance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital incurring debt or operating parts of our business that are not consolidated to the extent of our ownership interest therein into our financial statements we have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby we have subordinated retained interests derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks contingent liabilities or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing liquidity market risk or credit risk support to us 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we face exposure to financial market risks including adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 

foreign currency exchange risk 

our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to western european countries japan china and canada we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates that arise from receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies we do not enter into or hold foreign currency derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes nor do we enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge future cash flow or forecast transactions 

our nonus revenues generally are transacted through our nonus subsidiaries and typically are denominated in their local currency in addition expenses that are incurred by our nonus subsidiaries typically are denominated in their local currency in 2012 2011 and 2010 approximately two thirds of our revenue and half of our expenses were transacted in currencies other than the us dollar currency translation affects our reported results because we report our results of operations in us dollars historically our most significant currency risk has been changes in the euro relative to the us dollar based on current revenue and expense levels a 010 change in the usd to euro exchange rate would impact operating income by approximately 15 million 

our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations arises in part from intercompany transactions with most intercompany transactions occurring between a us dollar functional currency entity and a foreign currency denominated entity intercompany transactions typically are denominated in the local currency of the nonus dollar functional currency subsidiary in order to centralize foreign currency risk also both ptc the parent company and our nonus subsidiaries may transact business with our customers and vendors in a currency other than their functional currency transaction risk in addition we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results and balances of our nonus subsidiaries are translated into us dollars translation risk if sales to customers outside of the united states increase our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could increase 

our foreign currency risk management strategy is principally designed to mitigate the future potential financial impact of changes in the us dollar value of balances denominated in foreign currency resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates our foreign currency hedging program uses forward contracts to manage the foreign currency exposures that 

exist as part of our ongoing business operations the contracts primarily are denominated in canadian dollars and european currencies and have maturities of less than three months 

generally we do not designate foreign currency forward contracts as hedges for accounting purposes and changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized immediately in earnings because we enter into forward contracts only as an economic hedge any gain or loss on the underlying foreigndenominated balance would be offset by the loss or gain on the forward contract gains and losses on forward contracts and foreign denominated receivables and payables are included in foreign currency net losses 

as of september 30 2012 and 2011 we had outstanding forward contracts with notional amounts equivalent to the following 

  



debt 

as of september 30 2012 the amount outstanding under our variablerate credit facility was 370 million including a term loan of 150 million and a revolving credit facility of 220 million loans under the credit facility bear interest at variable rates which reset every 30  to 180  days depending on the rate and period selected by the company these loans are subject to interest rate risk as interest rates will be adjusted at each rollover date to the extent such amounts are not repaid as of september 30 2012 the annual rate is 18125 which will reset on november 15 2012 for the term loan and december 13 2012 for the revolving loan at which time accrued interest is due and the interest rate will reset to then current rates as defined in the loan agreement if there was a hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates the annual net impact to earnings and cash flows would be 37 million this hypothetical change in cash flows and earnings has been calculated based on the borrowings outstanding at september 30 2012 and a 100 basis point per annum change in interest rate applied over a oneyear period 

cash and cash equivalents 

as of september 30 2012 cash equivalents were invested in highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased we invest our cash with highly rated financial institutions in north america europe and asiapacific and in diversified domestic and international money market mutual funds at september 30 2012 we had cash and cash equivalents of 811 million in europe 2958 million in the united states 756 million in the pacific rim including india 196 million in japan and 174 million in other nonus countries given the short maturities and investment grade quality of the portfolio holdings at september 30 2012 a hypothetical 10 change in interest rates would not materially affect the fair value of our cash and cash equivalents 

our invested cash is subject to interest rate fluctuations and for nonus operations foreign currency risk in a declining interest rate environment we would experience a decrease in interest income the opposite holds true in a rising interest rate environment over the past several years the us federal reserve board european central bank and bank of england have changed certain benchmark interest rates which have led to declines and increases in market interest rates these changes in market interest rates have resulted in fluctuations in interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents interest income will continue to fluctuate based on changes in market interest rates and levels of cash available for investment our consolidated cash balances were impacted favorably by 07 million and 64 million in 2012 and 2011 respectively and unfavorably by 13 million in 2010 due to changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar particularly the euro and the japanese yen

i operational considerations 

our operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter making future operating results difficult to predict 

our quarterly operating results historically have fluctuated and are likely to continue to fluctuate depending on a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 accordingly our quarterly results are difficult to predict prior to the end of the quarter and we may be unable to confirm or adjust expectations with respect to our operating results for a particular quarter until that quarter has closed any failure to meet our quarterly revenue or earnings targets could adversely impact the market price of our stock 

economic weakness in the united states and globally may adversely affect our business 

the past three years have been characterized by weak global economic conditions tight credit markets reduced liquidity and extreme volatility in many financial markets we experienced a significant decline in revenue in 2009 in all geographic regions in which we operate as customers reduced or deferred purchases of our 

  

products and services although revenue increased year over year in each of 2010 and 2011 the economic environment remains uncertain if the economic environment does not improve or deteriorates our business may be unfavorably impacted 

competition is intensifying which may reduce our profits and limit or reduce our market share 

the market for product development solutions is rapidly changing and increasingly competitive we expect competition to intensify which could result in price reductions for our products and services reduced margins and loss of market share our primary competition comes from 

 

  

  

 the cax market is characterized by intense competition for customers the nature of this market which is relatively mature and whose growth has slowed and the number and nature of the competitive products which have increasingly similar functionality make it difficult to gain new customers moreover decreasing product differentiation and the training data conversion and other startup costs associated with system replacement make it more difficult to dislodge incumbent design systems although we saw increased revenue from this market in 2011 following the introduction of our new suite of creo cad solutions demand for creo may decline as customers complete purchases of creo sufficient for their operations which would adversely affect our results 

we must continually modify and enhance our products to keep pace with changing technology and to address our customers’ needs and expectations and any failure to do so could reduce demand for our products 

our ability to remain competitive will depend on our ability to enhance our current offerings and develop new products and services that keep pace with technological developments and meet evolving customer requirements in addition our solutions must meet customer expectations to be successful if our solutions fail to meet customer expectations customers may discontinue adoption of our solutions resulting in a loss of potential additional sales and we may be unable to retain existing customers or attract new customers 

our financial condition could be adversely affected if significant errors or defects are found in our software 

sophisticated software can sometimes contain errors defects or other performance problems if errors or defects are discovered in our current or future products we may need to expend significant financial technical and management resources or divert some of our development resources in order to resolve or work around those defects and we may not be able to correct them in a timely manner or provide an adequate response to our customers 

errors defects or other performance problems in our products could cause us to delay new product releases or customer deployments any such delays could cause delays in our ability to realize revenue from the licensing and shipment of new or enhanced products and give our competitors a greater opportunity to market competing products such difficulties could also cause us to lose customers technical problems or the loss of customers could also damage our business reputation and cause us to lose new business opportunities 

  

businesses we acquire may not generate the revenue and earnings we anticipated and may otherwise adversely affect our business 

we have acquired and intend to continue to acquire new businesses and technologies if we fail to successfully integrate and manage the businesses and technologies we acquire our operating results may be adversely affected 

moreover business combinations also involve a number of risks and uncertainties that can adversely affect our operations and operating results including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we are dependent on key personnel whose loss could impair our operations our product development or our sales efforts 

our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial technical and sales personnel 

we require highly skilled technical personnel to develop our products competition for such personnel in our industry is intense if we are unable to attract and retain technical personnel with the requisite skills our product development efforts could be delayed which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

our sales efforts rely on having a sufficient number of sales representatives and sales support personnel with the skills and knowledge necessary to sell our products including an ability to educate our customers about our products in order to create and meet demand for our products if we are unable to attract or retain sales and sales support personnel with the requisite expertise our revenue could be adversely affected 

at times we provide extended payment terms to our customers which may be a factor in our customers’ purchasing decisions and our revenues could be adversely affected if we ceased making these terms available 

we have provided extended payment terms to certain customers in connection with transactions we have completed with them providing extended payment terms may positively influence our customers’ purchasing decisions but may reduce our cash flows in the shortterm if we reduce the amount of extended payment terms we provide to customers customers might reduce or defer the amount they spend on our products from the amount they might otherwise have spent if extended payment terms were available to them if this were to occur our revenue or revenue growth could be lower than in prior periods andor lower than we expect 

we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights 

our software products and trademarks including our company names product names and logos are proprietary we protect our intellectual property rights in these items by relying on copyrights trademarks patents and common law safeguards including trade secret protection as well as restrictions on disclosures and transferability contained in our agreements with other parties despite these measures the laws of all relevant jurisdictions may not afford adequate protection to our products and other intellectual property in addition we 

  

frequently encounter attempts by individuals and companies to pirate our software solutions if our measures to protect our intellectual property rights fail others may be able to use those rights which could reduce our competitiveness and revenues 

intellectual property infringement claims could be asserted against us which could be expensive to defend and could result in limitations on our use of the claimed intellectual property 

the software industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding copyright patent and other intellectual property rights while we have not had any significant claims of this type asserted against us such claims could be asserted against us in the future if a lawsuit of this type is filed it could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel we cannot be sure that we would prevail against any such asserted claims if we did not prevail we could be prevented from using the claimed intellectual property or required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements which might not be available on terms acceptable to us in addition to possible claims with respect to our proprietary products some of our products contain technology developed by and licensed from third parties and we may likewise be susceptible to infringement claims with respect to these thirdparty technologies 

our sales and operations are globally dispersed which exposes us to additional operating and compliance risks 

we sell and deliver software and services and maintain support operations in a large number of countries whose laws and practices differ from one another north america accounted for 37 europe for 40 and asiapacific for 23 of our revenue in 2011 managing these geographically dispersed operations requires significant attention and resources to ensure compliance with laws accordingly while we strive to maintain a comprehensive compliance program we cannot guarantee that an employee agent or business partner will not act in violation of our policies or us or other applicable laws such violations can lead to civil andor criminal prosecutions substantial fines and the revocation of our rights to continue certain operations and also cause business and reputation loss 

our cost structure is relatively fixed in the short term which makes it difficult to reduce our expenses quickly in response to declines in revenue or revenue growth 

we make expenditures to support our revenue growth in advance of achieving the expected revenue our expenses associated with headcount and facilities can be difficult to reduce quickly due to the nature of those items if revenue does not grow as we expect or if it declines our expenses may constitute a larger percentage of our operating budget than we planned which would adversely affect our profitability 

consulting and training services margins are significantly lower than license and maintenance margins increases in consulting and training services revenue as a percent of total revenue could decrease our overall margins 

because our enterprise license solutions generally require more services to implement than our desktop license solutions and because enterprise solutions represent an increasing percentage of our revenue services revenue as a percent of total revenue may increase future projected improvements in our operating margin percent are predicated in part on our ability to improve consulting and training services margins through operating efficiencies leverage and increased use of outside service providers if our services revenue increases as a percentage of total revenue andor if we are unable to improve our services margins our overall operating margin may not increase or may decrease which could adversely impact our stock price 

our current research and development efforts may not generate revenue for several years if at all 

developing and localizing software products is expensive and the investment in product development often involves a long return on investment cycle we have made and expect to continue to make significant investments in research and development and related product opportunities that could adversely affect our operating results if not offset by revenue increases we believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position 

  

we depend on sales within the discrete manufacturing market and our revenue is likely to decrease if manufacturing activity slows 

a large amount of our revenues are related to sales to customers in the discrete manufacturing sector a decline in general economic or business conditions or a decline in spending in the manufacturing sector could cause customers to reduce or defer spending on our products which would cause our revenue and earnings to decrease or to grow more slowly 

a significant portion of our revenue is generated from maintenance contracts decreases in maintenance renewal rates or a decrease in the number of new licenses we sell would negatively impact our future maintenance revenue and operating results 

a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from maintenance contracts these contracts are generally renewed on an annual basis and typically have a high rate of customer renewal in addition to the recurring revenue base associated with these contracts a majority of customers purchasing new perpetual licenses also purchase related annual maintenance contracts if the rate of renewal for these contracts or the level of maintenance revenue associated with new licenses is adversely affected by economic or other factors our maintenance revenue growth and profitability will be adversely affected 

we may have exposure to additional tax liabilities and our effective tax rate may increase or fluctuate which could increase our income tax expense and reduce our net income 

as a multinational organization we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes in the us and in various foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision and other tax liabilities in the ordinary course of a global business there are many intercompany transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain our tax returns are subject to review by various taxing authorities although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable there is no assurance that the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 

our effective tax rate can be adversely affected by several factors many of which are outside of our control including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 our sales to government clients subject us to risks of funding approvals 

we derive revenues from contracts with the us government state and local governments and their respective agencies there is increased pressure for governments and their agencies to reduce spending many of our federal government contracts contain fiscal funding clauses whereby ongoing funding of the contracts is subject to approval of appropriations by the us congress similarly our contracts at the state and local levels are subject to government funding authorizations although we have no indication that funding for current contracts will not be approved if additional funding for these contracts is not approved it could reduce revenue we have recognized and reduce future revenue from such contracts 

  

ii other considerations 

we have been investigating certain matters in china which matters and related remedial actions could have an adverse effect on our business 

we have been investigating payments by certain business partners and expenses by certain employees in china that raise questions of compliance with laws including the foreign corrupt practices act andor compliance with our business policies in connection with this matter we have terminated certain employees and business partners in china which may have an adverse impact on our level of sales in china until such replacements for those employees and business partners are in place and productive revenue from china has historically represented 6 to 7 of our total revenue we have voluntarily disclosed the results of our investigation and associated remedial actions to the united states department of justice and the securities and exchange commission we are unable to predict the outcome of these voluntary disclosures which could include fines or other sanctions 

we are required to comply with certain financial and operating covenants under our credit facility and any failure to comply with those covenants could cause amounts borrowed under the facility to become immediately due and payable or prevent us from borrowing under the facility 

under the terms of our credit facility we may borrow up to 300 million with an accordion feature that allows us to borrow up to an additional 150 million if the existing or additional lenders agree repay the same in whole or in part and reborrow at any time through september 30 2016 at which time any amounts outstanding will be due and payable in full our current balance outstanding under the credit facility is 240 million primarily related to our acquisition of mks in the third quarter of 2011 we may wish to borrow additional amounts under the facility in the future to support our operations including for strategic acquisitions 

we are required to comply with specified financial and operating covenants which limit our ability to operate our business as we otherwise might operate it our failure to comply with any of these covenants or to meet any payment obligations under the facility could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived would result in any amounts outstanding including any accrued interest and unpaid fees becoming immediately due and payable we might not have sufficient working capital or liquidity to satisfy any repayment obligations in the event of an acceleration of those obligations in addition if we are not in compliance with the financial and operating covenants at the time we wish to borrow funds we will be unable to borrow funds 

our stock price has been volatile which may make it harder to resell your shares at a time and at a price that is favorable to you 

market prices for securities of software companies are generally volatile and are subject to significant fluctuations unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies the trading prices and valuations of these stocks and of ours may not be predictable negative changes in the public’s perception of the prospects of software companies or of ptc or the markets we serve could depress our stock price regardless of our operating results 

also a large percentage of our common stock is held by institutional investors purchases and sales of our common stock by these institutional investors could have a significant impact on the market price of the stock for more information about those investors please see our proxy statement with respect to our most recent annual meeting of stockholders and schedules 13d and 13g filed with the sec with respect to our common stock

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend the european commission is conducting an investigation of allegedly anticompetitive practices within the european economic area with respect to cad and related software in connection with its investigation the commission has requested information from ptc and we understand from other vendors as well ptc has cooperated to provide the requested information no charges or proceedings have been initiated by the commission against ptc however the commission has authority to impose significant fines if it identifies violations of european competition laws as a result of its investigation 

we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business we currently believe that resolving these matters will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows however the results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty should any of these legal matters be resolved against us the operating results for a particular reporting period could be adversely affected

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend forwardlooking statements 

statements in this annual report about anticipated financial results and growth as well as about the development of our products and markets are forwardlooking statements that are based on our current plans and assumptions important information about the bases for these plans and assumptions and factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements is contained below and in item 1a “risk factors” of this annual report 

unless otherwise indicated all references to a year reflect our fiscal year that ends on september 30 

executive overview 

our momentum continued in 2011 and we achieved 117 billion in revenue our highest annual revenue ever this represented 16 revenue growth over 2010 12 on a constant currency basis we posted solid growth across our license maintenance and services lines of business which we attribute to increased demand for our products and services as a result of improvement in the economy our competitive positioning and significant new product releases specific achievements and items that contributed significantly to our revenue results for the year include 

 

  

  

 our nongaap operating margin increased to 18 in 2011 from 16 in 2010 to 10 from 7 on a gaap basis due to increased revenue and operating scale improvements research and development expense as a percent of consolidated revenue was 18 in 2011 and 20 in 2010 during 2011 we also made measured investments in sales capacity to capitalize on longterm growth opportunities 

we ended the year with 168 million of cash and 100 million available under our revolving credit facility we used approximately 50 million of cash and borrowed 250 million under the credit facility to acquire mks 50 million of which we repaid by year end we also repurchased 55 million worth of shares of our common stock in 2011 

revenue operating margin earnings per share and cash flow 

the following table shows the financial measures that we consider the most significant indicators of the performance of our business in addition to providing operating income operating margin and diluted earnings per share as calculated under generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” it shows nongaap operating income operating margin and diluted earnings per share for the reported periods these nongaap measures exclude a fair value adjustment related to acquired deferred maintenance revenue stockbased compensation amortization of acquired intangible assets expense acquisitionrelated charges restructuring charges inprocess research and development expenses onetime gains or charges included in nonoperating other income expense and the related tax effects of the preceding items and any one–time tax items excluding those expenses and 

  

onetime items provides investors another view of our operating results which is aligned with management budgets and with performance criteria in our incentive compensation plans management uses and investors should use nongaap measures in conjunction with our gaap results we discuss the nongaap measures in detail under “income and margins earnings per share” below 

 

  

   2011 compared to 2010 

revenue in 2011 grew 16 12 on a constant currency basis compared to 2010 excluding the impact of acquisitions our total revenue was 11401 million up 13 and our license revenue was 3317 million up 12 over 2010 we had growth in all lines of business reflecting increased demand for our products and services we attribute this increased demand to improvement in the economy and the strength of our products we have seen continued strength in enterprise maintenance and consulting services following a strong enterprise license revenue year in 2010 additionally the launch of creo has positively impacted desktop license revenue and maintenance revenue as customers have expanded their adoption and renewed seats under maintenance and new customers particularly in the small and mediumsize business space have been added 

  

during 2011 we saw a yearoveryear increase in the amount of revenue from customers for which license andor consulting and training revenue exceeded 1 million in a quarter suggesting improved breadth and depth of our business license andor consulting and training service revenue of 1 million or more recognized from individual customers in a quarter during 2011 totaled 2480 million compared with 1873 million in 2010 

our desktop license revenue and desktop total revenue grew 33 and 15 respectively in 2011 compared to 2010 attributable to an increase in the amount of large deals with direct customers our enterprise license revenue was down slightly year over year while total enterprise revenue grew 16 in 2011 compared to 2010 excluding the impact of mks and 4cs enterprise license revenue was down 7 year over year and total enterprise revenue was up 10 compared to 2010 enterprise results reflected year over year declines in license revenue in the first half of 2011 and improvement during the second half of fiscal 2011 with fourth quarter year over year license revenue growth of 30 11 when excluding the impact of acquisitions in the small and mediumsize business market we saw continued overall strength with indirect license revenue and total indirect revenue up 21 and 11 respectively in 2011 compared to 2010 the fourth quarter of 2011 was our seventh consecutive quarter of yearoveryear indirect license revenue and total indirect revenue growth 

costs and expenses in 2011 compared to 2010 were impacted by a number of factors including higher cost of service in support of services revenue growth investments in our direct sales force incremental headcount costs from acquisitions and a companywide merit pay increase these items are described in more detail in cost and expenses below 

our gaap and nongaap operating income increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to increased revenue and operating scale improvements particularly in research and development productivity which as a percent of consolidated revenue was 18 in 2011 and 20 in 2010 during 2011 we also made measured investments in sales capacity to capitalize on longterm growth opportunities while operating income increased significantly in 2011 compared to 2010 gaap diluted earnings per share increased 248 in 2011 compared to 2010 due to a significantly higher income tax rate in 2010 and improved profitability our tax rate was 18 in 2011 compared with 70 in 2010 due in part to the onetime tax items described in footnote 2 in the table above nongaap diluted earnings per share grew 26 in 2011 compared to 2010 

cash flow from operating activities was 787 million in 2011 compared with 1566 million in 2010 the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the resolution of a litigation matter which reduced our cash balance by approximately 48 million in the first quarter of 2011 and the timing of cash collections on accounts receivable accounts receivable was 2302 million and 1693 million at september 30 2011 and 2010 respectively this increase in accounts receivable was due primarily to revenue in the fourth quarter of 2011 being 714 million higher than the fourth quarter of 2010 

2010 compared to 2009 

the increase in license revenue in 2010 was primarily driven by a 73 increase in enterprise license revenue due primarily to sales of windchill to large customers we believe the 39 increase in license revenue in 2010 compared with 2009 reflected an improved macroeconomic climate with customers resuming investments in important business process and information technology initiatives maintenance and consulting and training service revenue in 2010 were both negatively impacted by our weak license sales in 2009 however this revenue grew modestly in the second half of 2010 compared to the second half of 2009 

costs and expenses in 2010 compared to 2009 increased primarily due to the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements described below costs associated with investments in product development made beginning in the second half of 2009 higher incentivebased compensation and higher commissions resulting from higher license revenue in 2010 

  

these cost increases were partially offset by the impact of headcount reductions made in the third and fourth quarters of 2009 and related restructuring charges recorded in gaap operating income in 2009 

our gaap and nongaap operating income increased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily because of the increase in license revenue while operating income increased significantly in 2010 compared to 2009 gaap diluted earnings per share decreased in 2010 compared to 2009 due to a significantly higher income tax rate in 2010 our tax rate was 70 in 2010 compared to a benefit of 84 in 2009 due in part to the onetime tax items described in footnote 2 in the table above 

cash flow from operating activities was 1566 million in 2010 compared with 697 million in 2009 the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to higher profitability lower incentive compensation payments related to 2009 year end compensation accruals and lower income tax payments partially offset by 2009 benefitting from cash collections of 2008 accounts receivable which totaled 2015 million as of september 30 2008 

fiscal year 2012 expectations strategies and risks 

based on 2011 results current economic conditions and spending patterns the competitive strength of our products and a full year of revenue contribution from mks we expect 14 to 15 revenue growth in 2012 compared to 2011 with license revenue growth of approximately 20 maintenance revenue growth of approximately 11 and services revenue growth of approximately 14 further our goal is to improve operating margins by 100 basis points in 2012 accordingly as one of our strategic initiatives in 2012 we are continuing to add sales capacity to address market opportunities while at the same time we are being disciplined about our broader spending and staffing plans an additional strategic initiative is to continue to expand our services ecosystem by adding strategic services partners to focus on smaller engagements enabling us to focus on larger engagements 

our current expectations are that we will be able to grow revenue and improve our operating margins however given the uncertain economic environment if revenue is lower than we expect we may reduce or delay strategic investments andor take actions to reduce our operating costs 

our results have been impacted and we expect will continue to be impacted by revenue from large customers the amount of revenue particularly license revenue attributable to large transactions and the number of such transactions may vary significantly from quarter to quarter based on customer purchasing decisions and macroeconomic conditions our growth rates have become increasingly dependent on adoption of our plm solutions among large direct customers such transactions tend to be larger in size and may have long lead times as they often follow a lengthy product selection and evaluation process this may cause increased volatility in our results our revenue and operating results may also continue to be impacted by currency fluctuations 

impact of an investigation in china 

we have been investigating payments by certain business partners and expenses by certain employees in china that raise questions of compliance with laws including the foreign corrupt practices act andor compliance with our business policies in connection with this matter we have terminated certain employees and business partners in china which may have an adverse impact on our level of sales in china until such replacements for those employees and business partners are in place and productive revenue from china has historically represented 6 to 7 of our total revenue we have voluntarily disclosed the results of our investigation and associated remedial actions to the united states department of justice and the securities and exchange commission we are unable to predict the outcome of these voluntary disclosures which could include fines or other sanctions 

  

results of operations 

acquisitions 

we acquired mks a global application lifecycle management alm technology leader on may 31 2011 in early september we acquired 4c solutions inc 4cs a developer of warranty management and service lifecycle management slm software the acquisition of 4cs broadens ptc’s portfolio of solutions for product support and service organizations and supports ptc’s vision for solutions that span both product and service lifecycles 

the results of operations of acquired businesses have been included in ptc’s consolidated financial statements beginning on their respective acquisition dates these acquisitions added 268 million to our 2011 revenue 294 million on a nongaap basis less than 1 million of which was related to 4cs and added 377 million of costs and expenses including acquisitionrelated costs of 78 million and amortization of acquired intangible assets of 37 million or 256 million on a nongaap basis in 2012 these acquisitions are expected to add approximately 90 to 100 million in nongaap revenue approximately 3 million less on a gaap basis and be slightly accretive to our nongaap eps results as operating profitability is offset by interest payments on the debt and investments we are making in the acquired businesses to capitalize on their longterm growth opportunity mks and 4cs revenue is classified as “enterprise” revenue 

impact of foreign currency exchange on results of operations 

approximately two thirds of our revenue and half of our expenses are transacted in currencies other than the us dollar currency translation affects our reported results because we report our results of operations in us dollars on a yearoveryear comparative basis our revenue for 2011 and 2010 benefited as a result of changes in currency exchange rates primarily for the euro and the japanese yen and our expenses were also higher conversely in 2009 our revenue and expenses were lower as a result of changes in currency rates if actual reported results were converted into us dollars based on the corresponding prior year’s foreign currency exchange rates 2011 and 2010 revenue would have been lower by 368 million and 155 million respectively and expenses would have been lower by 210 million and 115 million respectively and 2009 revenue and expenses would have been higher by 385 million and 410 million respectively the net impact on yearoveryear results would have been decreases in operating income of 158 million 40 million and 25 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively the results of operations revenue by line of business and revenue by geographic region in the tables that follow present both actual percentage changes year over year and percentage changes on a constant currency basis 

revenue 

our revenue consists of software license revenue and service revenue service revenue includes software maintenance revenue consisting of providing our customers software updates and technical support as well as consulting and training revenue including implementation services 

desktop revenue includes our cax solutions creo parametric creo elementsdirect arbortext authoring products and mathcad enterprise revenue includes our plm solutions windchill arbortext enterprise products creo view and integrity 

direct revenue includes sales made primarily by our direct sales force to large businesses indirect revenue includes sales by our reseller channel primarily to small and mediumsize businesses as well as revenue from other accounts that we have classified as indirect if the classification of a customer changes between direct and indirect we reclassify the historical revenue associated with that customer to align with the current period classification such reclassifications were not material in any of the years presented 

  

revenue by product group and distribution channel 

 

 revenue by line of business 

 

  

   

license revenue 

2011 compared to 2010 

the increase in overall license revenue in 2011 was due primarily to growth in direct desktop revenue from sales to our large commercial customers additionally we are continuing to see strength in license revenue from small and mediumsize customers with increases in both indirect desktop and enterprise license revenue we attribute the increase in desktop license sales to the recent launch of creo which has resulted in orders from our existing customer base and an increase in sales to new customers in our reseller channel additionally we attribute the increase in desktop license revenue to the economic recovery resulting in renewed customer demand 

mks contributed 104 million to enterprise license revenue in 2011 excluding mks enterprise license revenue was down 7 year over year reflecting declines in the first half of 2011 we began to see improvements in enterprise license revenue in the second half of 2011 with yearoveryear growth in the fourth quarter of 30 11 when excluding the impact of acquisitions enterprise license revenue results reflect decreases in revenue from sales of windchill which were 19 226 million lower in 2011 compared to 2010 we attribute some of this decline to the fact that 2010 was a particularly strong comparison period which included several large windchill transactions in addition we believe that one of the primary factors adversely impacting the enterprise license revenue performance in 2011 is the dilutive impact of increased desktop revenue on our enterprise sales capacity as a result we began expanding our sales capacity in the second half of 2011 and we plan to continue to expand our sales capacity over the next four quarters 

foreign currency exchange rate movements favorably impacted license revenue by 114 million in 2011 compared to 2010 

2010 compared to 2009 

the growth in enterprise license revenue was driven by sales of windchill which were 72 504 million higher in 2010 than 2009 the increase in desktop license revenue in 2010 compared to 2009 was due primarily to an increase of 28 150 million in sales of new proengineer licenses license revenue was favorably impacted by 23 million in 2010 as a result of foreign currency exchange rate movements 

consulting and training revenue 

2011 compared to 2010 

consulting and training services engagements typically result from sales of new licenses particularly of our enterprise solutions accordingly strong enterprise license sales in 2010 had a favorable impact on services revenue in 2011 in 2011 compared to 2010 consulting revenue which is primarily related to windchill implementations among our direct enterprise customers was up 23 429 million and training revenue which typically represents about 15 of our total consulting and training services revenue was up 23 66 million in addition mks contributed 55 million to enterprise consulting and training service revenue in 2011 

foreign currency exchange rate movements favorably impacted consulting and training services revenue by 83 million in 2011 compared to 2010 

2010 compared to 2009

represents about 15 of our total consulting and training services revenue was down 11 in 2010 direct enterprise consulting and training service revenue which comprised over 75 of our total consulting and training service revenue in 2010 and 2009 was flat in 2010 

consulting and training services revenue in 2010 was favorably impacted by 39 million as a result of foreign currency exchange rate movements 

maintenance revenue 

maintenance revenue represents revenue from renewals of licenses under maintenance and maintenance on new licenses 

2011 compared to 2010 

we have seen steady growth in maintenance revenue in 2011 particularly in the second half of the year our recent launch of creo has reinvigorated our base of desktop customers and resulted in increases in our desktop maintenance revenue enterprise maintenance revenue in 2011 benefitted from strong enterprise license sales in fiscal 2010 enterprise license revenue in fiscal 2010 was 73 652 million higher than fiscal 2009 in addition mks contributed 100 million to enterprise maintenance revenue in 2011 creo and windchill seats under maintenance increased 7 and 19 respectively as of the end of 2011 compared to the end 2010 

foreign currency exchange rate movements favorably impacted maintenance revenue by 172 million in 2011 compared to 2010 

2010 compared to 2009 

while maintenance revenue in 2010 was adversely impacted by the global economic climate and soft license sales in 2009 it was favorably impacted by 92 million as a result of foreign currency exchange rate movements desktop maintenance revenue decreased 3 106 million in 2010 and enterprise maintenance revenue increased 6 79 million in 2010 creo seats under maintenance decreased 2 and windchill seats increased 32 respectively as of the end of 2010 compared to the end of 2009 

revenue by distribution channel 

we derive most of our revenue from products and services sold directly by our sales force to enduser customers we also sell products and services through thirdparty resellers and other strategic partners our sales force focuses on large accounts while our reseller channel provides a costeffective means of covering the small and mediumsize business market this enables our direct sales force to focus on larger sales opportunities and ensures greater coverage of all customer segments 

revenue results by distribution channel can be found in the table revenue by product group and distribution channel above 

direct 

our direct revenue was 73 72 and 70 of our total revenue in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively to address market demand and what we believe to be current capacity constraints we expanded the number of sales personnel in the second half of 2011 and we plan to add additional direct sales capacity in 2012 

indirect 

we have over 420 geographically dispersed resellers our resellers are focused primarily on selling our desktop products creo and mathcad and windchill pdmlink ®  

  

our indirect revenue typically comprises approximately 30 of our total revenue the fourth quarter of 2011 was our seventh consecutive quarter of yearoveryear growth in indirect license revenue and total indirect revenue we believe that this performance reflects improving macroeconomic conditions in addition we have seen an increase in the number of new customers served by our channel partners which we attribute in part to our recent release of creo 

while our small and mediumsize customers are more heavily affected by macroeconomic factors we are encouraged by recent results and we believe that the markets for desktop and enterprise solutions served by our indirect channel continue offer longterm growth potential 

revenue from individual customers 

we enter into customer contracts that may result in revenue being recognized over multiple reporting periods accordingly revenue recognized in a current period may be attributable to contracts entered into during the current period or in prior periods license andor consulting and training service revenue of 1 million or more recognized from individual customers in a single quarter during the fiscal year from contracts entered into during that quarter andor a prior quarter is shown in the table below the amount of revenue particularly license revenue attributable to large transactions and the number of such transactions may vary significantly from quarter to quarter based on customer purchasing decisions the completion of large services engagements commenced in previous quarters nonrenewal of large maintenance contracts and macroeconomic conditions 

the increase in license and consulting and training service revenue greater than 1 million from individual customers in a quarter in 2011 compared to 2010 reflects increased revenue from desktop licenses mainly creo and enterprise services partially offset by lower sales of enterprise licenses the increase in 2010 was due primarily to the sale of enterprise products to large direct customers

costs and expenses in 2010 compared to 2009 reflected higher costs due to 

 

  

  

  

  

 total costs and expenses in 2010 compared to 2009 reflect a 131 million increase in commissions due to higher license sales and a 192 million increase in incentivebased compensation due primarily to performancebased incentive plan targets which were fully achieved in 2010 while such targets were not achieved in full in 2009 these increases were partially offset by 227 million of restructuring costs incurred in 2009 

cost of license revenue 

 

 our cost of license revenue primarily consists of amortization of acquired purchased software intangible assets fixed and variable costs associated with reproducing and distributing software and documentation and royalties paid to third parties for technology embedded in or licensed with our software products cost of license revenue as a percent of license revenue can vary depending on product mix sold the effect of fixed and variable

in 2011 compared to 2010 total compensation benefit costs and travel expenses were 18 331 million higher primarily due to increased headcount additionally the cost of thirdparty consulting services was 118 million higher in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to the increase in consulting and training service revenue in 2011 service headcount at the end of 2011 increased by approximately 450 employees compared to the year ago period including approximately 150 employees from our acquisition of mks and approximately 60 employees from our acquisition of 4cs in the first quarter of 2011 we made a strategic decision to enter into a contract with an important customer in the automotive industry for which we expected our costs to exceed our revenue by approximately 5 million cost of service revenue in the first quarter of 2011 included immediate recognition of this loss of approximately 5 million 

total compensation benefit costs and travel expenses were 4 72 million higher in 2010 compared to 2009 the cost of thirdparty consulting services was 67 million lower in 2010 compared 2009 due to the decrease in consulting and training services in 2010 services headcount was up due to hiring to support planned revenue growth

our compensation benefit costs and travel expenses were higher by an aggregate of 141 million in 2010 compared to 2009 these costs increased primarily due to commissions which were higher by 138 million due to more license sales in 2010 than in 2009 in addition expenses were higher by 23 million related to our annual sales incentive meeting which was held in 2010 after being cancelled in 2009 while yearend headcount was up year over year average sales and marketing headcount decreased 4 in 2010 compared to 2009

total compensation benefit costs and travel costs were higher in 2010 compared to 2009 by an aggregate of 97 million including an 80 million increase in cash incentive plan and stockbased compensation expense this increase was due primarily to performancebased cash incentive plan targets which were fully achieved in 2010 while targets for such awards were not achieved in full in 2009 as well as to grants of fiscal 2010 stockbased awards being made in november 2009 our usual timing while the 2009 stockbased awards were not made until the third quarter of 2009 because we had insufficient shares available under the 2000 equity incentive plan earlier in the year 

  

amortization of acquired intangible assets 

 

 the amortization of acquired intangible assets line item on our statements of operations reflects the amortization of acquired nonproduct related intangible assets primarily customer and trademarkrelated intangible assets recorded in connection with completed acquisitions the increase in 2011 compared to 2010 was due primarily to amortization related to our acquisition of mks

foreign currency net losses include costs of hedging contracts certain realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains or losses and foreign exchange gains or losses resulting from the required periodend currency remeasurement of the assets and liabilities of our subsidiaries that use the us dollar as their functional currency because a large portion of our revenue and expenses is transacted in foreign currencies we engage in hedging transactions involving the use of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates foreign currency losses in 2011 included 44 million related to our acquisition of mks and the related settlement of forward contracts to purchase cdn292 million and 07 million from our litigation settlement in japan 

  

gain on litigation resolution 

in october 2010 we resolved litigation brought against us by ge japan as a result of the resolution of this matter we recorded a onetime gain of 90 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 the amount paid in the first quarter of 2011 to resolve this matter was included in accrued litigation on our balance sheet as of september 30 2010 and paid in the first quarter of 2011 

interest income 

interest income represents earnings on the investment of our available cash balances the increase in interest income in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to higher interest rates resulting in more interest earned on cash balances the decrease in interest income in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily due to lower interest rates resulting in less interest earned on cash balances 

interest expense 

interest expense is primarily related to interest on borrowings under our revolving credit facility as of september 30 2011 we had 200 million outstanding under our revolving credit facility the increase in interest expense in 2011 compared to 2010 is due to higher average amounts outstanding and higher interest rates while the decrease in interest expense in 2010 compared to 2009 is due to lower average amounts outstanding and lower interest rates the average interest rate on amounts outstanding under the credit facility was 21 16 and 32 in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

income taxes 

our effective income tax rate has fluctuated significantly in each of the past three years in 2010 and 2009 this was due primarily to the impact of discrete events described further below which created a onetime income tax provision in 2010 and a onetime income tax benefit in 2009 

 

 in 2011 our effective tax rate was lower than the 35 statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to our corporate structure in which our foreign taxes are at a net effective tax rate lower than the us rate and a 23 million tax benefit related to research and development rd triggered by a retroactive extension of the rd tax credit enacted in the first quarter of 2011 our 2011 tax provision reflects a 75 million provision related to a research and development cost sharing prepayment by a foreign subsidiary to the us a similar prepayment was made in 2010 resulting in a 60 million provision in that year as a result the net increase to the 2011 provision was 15 million 

in 2011 we continued our business reorganization of our legal entity structure which began in 2010 to support our tax and cash planning the 2011 reorganization resulted in a 464 million taxable gain in the us the tax on this gain was offset in part by the reversal of a deferred tax liability for unremitted earnings of a foreign subsidiary of 65 million established in 2010 in contemplation of this transaction the recognition of foreign tax credits previously not benefitted and foreign tax credits generated as a result of the transaction 

in 2010 our effective income tax rate differed from the 35 statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a onetime tax charge of 434 million recorded as a result of a business reorganization partially offset by foreign taxes at a net effective income tax rate lower than the us rate during the fourth quarter of 2010 we 

  

completed a reorganization of our legal entity structure to support our tax and cash planning the objective of this reorganization was to enable significant redeployment and repatriation of cash between our international and domestic operations this reorganization resulted in 446 million of foreign source taxable gain in the us which was offset by foreign tax credits primarily generated as a result of this transaction and carry forward credits available a significant amount of these carry forward credits was previously unrecognized due to the uncertainty of generating foreign source income in the us the net tax effect of this reorganization was a 434 million tax provision in the us while this reorganization resulted in a onetime increase in our tax rate of 53 it had no material effect on cash taxes paid and as a result was excluded from our nongaap earnings per share see income and margins earnings per share below our 2010 tax provision reflects a 60 million provision related to a research and development rd cost sharing prepayment by a foreign subsidiary to the us this prepayment had no impact on our 2010 tax rate as the same prepayment was made in 2009 as described below 

in 2009 our effective income tax rate differed from the 35 statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to 

 

  

  

  

 as of september 30 2011 we have a remaining valuation allowance of 138 million against net deferred tax assets in the us and a remaining valuation allowance of 248 million against net deferred tax assets in certain foreign jurisdictions the valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets in the us consists of 35 million for foreign tax credits and 103 million for research and development credits that we have determined are not likely to be realized the valuation allowance on foreign tax credits reflects the fact that deductions not credits are expected to be claimed in the us in future periods the valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets of certain foreign jurisdictions is established primarily for our net operating loss carryforwards the majority of which do not expire there are limitations imposed on the utilization of such net operating losses that could further restrict the recognition of any tax benefits 

as of september 30 2011 our net deferred tax asset balance of 1219 million primarily relates to our us operations we have concluded based on the weight of available evidence that most of our net deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized in the future in arriving at this conclusion we evaluated all available evidence including our cumulative profitability on a pretax basis for the last three years adjusted for permanent differences which includes the results of having taken certain tax planning actions we have taken and will continue to take measures to improve core earnings in the us and we expect us earnings to continue to improve in the near term if the us results do not improve as anticipated however a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets may be required we will continue to reassess our valuation allowance requirements each financial reporting period 

in the normal course of business ptc and its subsidiaries are examined by various taxing authorities including the internal revenue service irs in the united states we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate we are currently under audit by tax authorities in several foreign jurisdictions audits by tax authorities typically involve examination of the deductibility of certain permanent items limitations on net operating losses and tax credits although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in material changes in our estimates in 2009 we closed the irs examination of ptc’s us federal tax 

  

years 2005 through 2007 the completion of the examination resulted in a decrease of 94 million to the tax reserve and a net tax benefit of 03 million we also settled a foreign tax audit in the fourth quarter of 2009 resulting in a tax benefit of 22 million 

our future effective income tax rate may be materially impacted by the amount of income taxes associated with our foreign earnings which are taxed at rates different from the us federal statutory income tax rate as well as the timing and extent of the realization of deferred tax assets and changes in the tax law further our tax rate may fluctuate within a fiscal year including from quarter to quarter due to items arising from discrete events including settlements of tax audits and assessments the resolution or identification of tax position uncertainties and acquisitions of other companies 

income and margins earnings per share 

as shown in the table below our operating income and operating margins in 2011 increased compared to 2010 primarily due to margin contribution associated with higher revenue described in revenue above partially offset by higher costs and expenses described in costs and expenses above our gaap and nongaap operating income net income and operating margins were lowest in 2009 during the global economic crisis and have improved in 2010 and 2011 

the nongaap measures presented in the foregoing discussion of our results of operations and the respective most directly comparable gaap measures are 

 

  

  

  

  

 the nongaap measures exclude a fair value adjustment related to acquired mks deferred maintenance revenue stockbased compensation amortization of acquired intangible assets expense acquisitionrelated charges restructuring charges inprocess research and development expense onetime gains or charges included in nonoperating other income expense and the related tax effects of the preceding items and any one–time tax items these items are normally included in the comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with gaap our management excludes these items when evaluating our ongoing performance andor predicting our earnings trends and therefore excludes these items when presenting nongaap financial measures management uses and investors should consider nongaap measures in conjunction with our gaap results 

fair value of acquired mks deferred maintenance revenue is a purchase accounting adjustment recorded to reduce acquired deferred maintenance revenue to the fair value of the remaining obligation 

stockbased compensation expense is noncash expense relating to stockbased awards issued to executive officers employees and outside directors consisting of restricted stock stock options and restricted stock units 

amortization of acquired intangible assets expense and inprocess research and development expense are noncash expenses that are impacted by the timing and magnitude of our acquisitions we believe the assessment of our operations excluding these costs is relevant to our assessment of internal operations and comparisons to the performance of other companies in our industry 

acquisitionrelated charges are costs that are included in general and administrative expenses and include direct costs of acquisitions and expenses related to acquisition integration activities including transaction fees due diligence costs and severance and professional fees including legal and accounting costs related to the acquisition these costs are not considered part of our normal operations as the occurrence and amount will vary depending on the timing and size of acquisitions and the level of integration activity undertaken 

  

restructuring charges include excess facility and assetrelated restructuring charges and severance costs resulting from reductions of personnel driven by modifications to our business strategy and not as part of our normal operations these costs may vary in size based on our restructuring plan in addition our assumptions are continually reevaluated which may increase or reduce the charges in a specific period 

we use these nongaap measures and we believe that they assist our investors to make periodtoperiod comparisons of our operational performance because they provide a view of our operating results without items that are not in our view indicative of our core operating results we believe that these nongaap measures help illustrate underlying trends in our business and we use the measures to establish budgets and operational goals communicated internally and externally for managing our business and evaluating our performance we believe that providing nongaap measures affords investors a view of our operating results that may be more easily compared to the results of peer companies in addition compensation of our executives is based in part on the performance of our business based on these nongaap measures 

the items excluded from the nongaap measures often have a material impact on our financial results and such items often recur accordingly the nongaap measures included in this annual report should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for or superior to the comparable measures prepared in accordance with gaap 

  

the following tables reconcile each of these nongaap measures to its most closely comparable gaap measure on our financial statements 

 

  

   

    critical accounting policies and estimates 

we have prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america in preparing our financial statements we make estimates assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our reported revenues results of operations and net income as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet these estimates assumptions and judgments are necessary because future events and their effects on our results and the value of our assets cannot be determined with certainty and are made based on our historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances these estimates may change as new events occur or additional information is obtained and we may periodically be faced with uncertainties the outcomes of which are not within our control and may not be known for a prolonged period of time 

the accounting policies methods and estimates used to prepare our financial statements are described generally in note b of “notes to consolidated financial statements” the most important accounting judgments and estimates that we made in preparing the financial statements involved 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 a critical accounting policy is one that is both material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires us to make difficult subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate and different estimates that we could have used or changes in the estimates that are reasonably likely to occur may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process actual results could differ from those estimates 

accounting policies guidelines and interpretations related to our critical accounting policies and estimates are generally subject to numerous sources of authoritative guidance and are often reexamined by accounting 

  

standards rule makers and regulators these rule makers andor regulators may promulgate interpretations guidance or regulations that may result in changes to our accounting policies which could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 

revenue recognition 

we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with determining the amounts of software license and services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period 

our primary judgments involve the following 

 

  

  

  

 we derive revenues from three primary sources 1 software licenses 2 maintenance services and 3 consulting and training services revenue by type for 2011 2010 and 2009 was as follows 

 

 for software license arrangements that do not require significant modification or customization of the underlying software we recognize revenue when 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 2 delivery has occurred generally fob shipping point or electronic distribution 3 the fee is fixed or determinable and 4 collection is probable substantially all of our license revenues are recognized in this manner 

our software is distributed primarily through our direct sales force in addition we have an indirect distribution channel through alliances with resellers revenue arrangements with resellers are recognized on a sellthrough basis that is when we deliver the product to the enduser customer we record consideration given to a reseller as a reduction of revenue to the extent we have recorded revenue from the reseller we do not offer contractual rights of return stock balancing or price protection to our resellers and actual product returns from them have been insignificant to date as a result we do not maintain reserves for reseller product returns 

at the time of each sale transaction we must make an assessment of the collectability of the amount due from the customer revenue is only recognized at that time if management deems that collection is probable in making this assessment we consider customer creditworthiness and historical payment experience at that same time we assess whether fees are fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties in assessing whether the fee is fixed or determinable we consider the payment terms of the transaction including transactions with payment terms that extend beyond our customary payment terms and our collection experience in similar transactions without making concessions among other factors we have periodically provided financing to creditworthy customers with payment terms up to 24 months if the fee is determined not to be fixed or determinable revenue is recognized only as payments become due from the customer provided that all 

  

other revenue recognition criteria are met our software license arrangements generally do not include customer acceptance provisions however if an arrangement includes an acceptance provision we record revenue only upon the earlier of 1 receipt of written acceptance from the customer or 2 expiration of the acceptance period 

our software arrangements often include implementation and consulting services that are sold under consulting engagement contracts or as part of the software license arrangement when we determine that such services are not essential to the functionality of the licensed software we record revenue separately for the license and service elements of these arrangements provided that appropriate evidence of fair value exists for the undelivered services see discussion below generally we consider that a service is not essential to the functionality of the software based on various factors including if the services may be provided by independent third parties experienced in providing such consulting and implementation in coordination with dedicated customer personnel and whether the services result in significant modification or customization of the software functionality when consulting services qualify for separate accounting consulting revenues under time and materials billing arrangements are recognized as the services are performed consulting revenues under fixedpriced contracts are generally recognized as the services are performed using a proportionate performance model with hours or costs as the input method of attribution when we provide consulting services considered essential to the functionality of the software the arrangement does not qualify for separate accounting of the license and service elements and the license revenue is recognized together with the consulting services using the percentageofcompletion method of contract accounting under such arrangements consideration is recognized as the services are performed as measured by an observable input in these circumstances we separate license revenue from service revenue for income statement presentation by allocating vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value of the consulting services as service revenue and the residual portion as license revenue under the percentageofcompletion method we estimate the stage of completion of contracts with fixed or “not to exceed” fees based on hours or costs incurred to date as compared with estimated total project hours or costs at completion adjustments to estimates to complete are made in the periods in which facts resulting in a change become known when total cost estimates exceed revenues we accrue for the estimated losses when identified the use of the proportionate performance and percentageofcompletion methods of accounting require significant judgment relative to estimating total contract costs or hours hours being a proxy for costs including assumptions relative to the length of time to complete the project the nature and complexity of the work to be performed and anticipated changes in salaries and other costs 

we generally use the residual method to recognize revenue from software arrangements that include one or more elements to be delivered at a future date when evidence of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists and the elements of the arrangement qualify for separate accounting as described above under the residual method the fair value of the undelivered elements ie maintenance consulting and training services based on vsoe is deferred and the remaining portion of the total arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements ie software license if evidence of the fair value of one or more of the undelivered services does not exist all revenues are deferred and recognized when delivery of all of those services has occurred or when fair values can be established we determine vsoe of the fair value of services revenue based upon our recent pricing for those services when sold separately for certain transactions vsoe of the fair value of maintenance services is determined based on a substantive maintenance renewal clause within a customer contract our current pricing practices are influenced primarily by product type purchase volume sales channel and customer location we review services sold separately on a periodic basis and update when appropriate our vsoe of fair value for such services to ensure that it reflects our recent pricing experience 

generally our contracts are accounted for individually however when contracts are closely interrelated and dependent on each other it may be necessary to account for two or more contracts as one to reflect the substance of the group of contracts 

for subscriptionbased licenses license revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement in limited circumstances where the right to use the software license is contingent upon current payments of maintenance fees for software license and maintenance are recognized ratably over the initial maintenance term 

  

maintenance services generally include rights to unspecified upgrades when and if available telephone and internetbased support updates and bug fixes maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract on a straightline basis 

reimbursements of outofpocket expenditures incurred in connection with providing consulting services are included in services revenue with the offsetting expense recorded in cost of service revenue 

training services include onsite and classroom training training revenues are recognized as the related training services are provided 

accounting for income taxes 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to calculate our income tax expense based on taxable income by jurisdiction there are many transactions and calculations about which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain as a result our calculations involve estimates by management some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenuesharing costreimbursement and transfer pricing arrangements among related entities and the differing tax treatment of revenue and cost items across various jurisdictions if we were compelled to revise or to account differently for our arrangements that revision could affect our tax liability 

the income tax accounting process also involves estimating our actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheets we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized we must establish a valuation allowance as a charge to income tax expense 

as of september 30 2011 we have a remaining valuation allowance of 138 million against net deferred tax assets in the us and a remaining valuation allowance of 248 million against net deferred tax assets in certain foreign jurisdictions the valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets in the us consists of 35 million for foreign tax credits and 103 million for research and development credits that we have determined are not likely to be realized the valuation allowance on foreign tax credits reflects the fact that deductions not credits are expected to be claimed in the us in future periods the valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets of certain foreign jurisdictions is established primarily for our net operating loss carryforwards the majority of which do not expire there are limitations imposed on the utilization of such net operating losses that could further restrict the recognition of any tax benefits 

as of september 30 2011 our net deferred tax asset balance of 1219 million primarily relates to our us operations we have concluded based on the weight of available evidence that most of our net deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized in the future in arriving at this conclusion we evaluated all available evidence including our cumulative profitability on a pretax basis for the last three years adjusted for permanent differences which includes the results of having taken certain tax planning actions we have taken and will continue to take measures to improve core earnings in the us and we expect us earnings to continue to improve in the near term if the us results do not improve as anticipated however a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets may be required we will continue to reassess our valuation allowance requirements each financial reporting period 

in the normal course of business ptc and its subsidiaries are examined by various taxing authorities including the internal revenue service irs in the united states we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate we are currently under audit by tax authorities in several foreign jurisdictions audits by tax authorities typically involve examination of 

  

the deductibility of certain permanent items limitations on net operating losses and tax credits although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in material changes in our estimates 

valuation of assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations 

in accordance with business combination accounting we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and inprocess research and development based on their estimated fair values determining these fair values requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets 

our identifiable intangible assets acquired consist of developed technology core technology tradenames customer lists and contracts and software support agreements and related relationships developed technology consists of products that have reached technological feasibility core technology represents a combination of processes inventions and trade secrets related to the design and development of acquired products customer lists and contracts and software support agreements and related relationships represent the underlying relationships and agreements with customers of the acquired company’s installed base we have generally valued intangible assets using a discounted cash flow model critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to 

 

  

  

  

 in addition we estimate the useful lives of our intangible assets based upon the expected period over which we anticipate generating economic benefits from the related intangible asset 

net tangible assets consist of the fair values of tangible assets less the fair values of assumed liabilities and obligations except for deferred revenues net tangible assets were generally valued by us at the respective carrying amounts recorded by the acquired company as we believed that their carrying values approximated their fair values at the acquisition date 

the values assigned to deferred revenue reflect an amount equivalent to the estimated cost plus an appropriate profit margin to perform the services related to the acquired company’s software support contracts 

in addition uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date and we reevaluate these items quarterly with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill provided that we are within the measurement period up to one year from the acquisition date and we continue to collect information in order to determine their estimated values subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the estimated value of uncertain tax positions or tax related valuation allowances whichever comes first changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations 

our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable at that time but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions estimates or actual results 

  

when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a finitelived intangible asset may not be recoverable we perform an assessment of the asset for potential impairment this assessment is based on projected undiscounted future cash flows over the asset’s remaining life if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its undiscounted cash flows we record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset determined using projected discounted future cash flows of the asset 

valuation of goodwill 

our goodwill totaled 6134 million and 4185 million as of september 30 2011 and 2010 respectively 

we assess the impairment of goodwill on at least an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable factors we consider important on an overall company basis and reportable segment basis as applicable that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results significant changes in our use of the acquired assets or a significant change in the strategy for our business significant negative industry or economic trends a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period or a reduction of our market capitalization relative to net book value 

the goodwill impairment test prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires us to identify reporting units and to determine estimates of the fair values of our reporting units as of the date we test for impairment determining the fair value of our reporting units for the purpose of testing the potential impairment of individual assets and goodwill requires significant judgment by management different judgments could yield different results 

to conduct these tests of goodwill the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value if the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeded its fair value we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value of goodwill and its implied fair value we estimate the fair values of our reporting units using discounted cash flow valuation models those models require estimates of future revenues profits capital expenditures working capital terminal values based on revenue multiples and discount rates for each reporting unit we estimate these amounts by evaluating historical trends current budgets operating plans and industry data we conduct our annual impairment test of goodwill as of the end of the third quarter of each fiscal year we completed our annual impairment review as of july 2 2011 and concluded that no impairment charge was required as of that date the estimated fair value of each reporting unit was approximately double or better than its carrying value revenue growth and operating margin projections are significant assumptions in our analysis a 10 decrease in those assumptions would not have had an impact on the results of our impairment analysis 

accounting for pensions 

in the us we sponsor a frozen pension plan covering mostly inactive participants we make several assumptions that are used in calculating the expense and liability of this plan these key assumptions include the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate in selecting the expected longterm rate of return on assets we consider the average future rate of earnings expected on the funds invested to provide for the benefits under the pension plan this includes considering the plan’s asset allocations and the expected returns likely to be earned over the life of this plan the discount rate reflects the estimated rate at which an amount that is invested in a portfolio of highquality debt instruments would provide the future cash flows necessary to pay benefits when they come due the us discount rate is determined using a spot rate yield curve method based on the citigroup pension discount curve the discount rate for germany was selected with reference to a spotrate yield curve based on the yields of aarated eurodenominated corporate bonds in addition our actuarial consultants determine the expense and liabilities of the plan using other assumptions for future experience such as mortality rates the actuarial assumptions used by us may differ materially from actual results due to changing 

  

market and economic conditions or longer or shorter life spans of the participants our actual results could differ materially from those we estimated which could require us to record a greater amount of pension expense in future years andor require higher than expected cash contributions in determining our us pension cost for 2011 2010 and 2009 we used a discount rate of 500 550 and 750 respectively and an expected return on plan assets of 725 for 2011 and 750 for 2010 and 2009 

certain of our international subsidiaries also sponsor pension plans accounting and reporting for these plans requires the use of countryspecific assumptions for discount rates and expected rates of return on assets we apply a consistent methodology in determining the key assumptions that in addition to future experience assumptions such as mortality rates are used by our actuaries to determine our liability and expense for each of these plans in determining our pension cost for 2011 2010 and 2009 we used weighted average discount rates of 40 51 and 57 respectively and weighted average expected returns on plan assets of 56 61 and 62 respectively 

in 2011 our actual return on plan assets in total for all plans was a loss of 16 million while in 2010 and 2009 our actual return on plan assets was a gain of 77 million and 18 million respectively continued distress in global financial markets has caused among other things extreme volatility in security prices severely diminished liquidity and credit availability rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuation of others if actual returns are below our expected rates of return it will impact the amount and timing of future contributions and expense for these plans 

as of september 30 2011 and 2010 our plans in total were underfunded representing the difference between our projected benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets by 682 million and 573 million respectively the projected benefit obligation as of september 30 2011 was determined using a discount rate of 45 for the us plan and a weighted average discount rate of 48 for our international plans the most sensitive assumptions used in calculating the expense and liability of our pension plans are the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets total net periodic pension cost was 50 million in 2011 and we expect it to be approximately 6 million in 2012 a 50 basis point change to our discount rate and expected return on plan assets assumptions would have changed our pension expense for the year ended september 30 2011 by less than 1 million a 50 basis point decrease in our discount rate assumptions would increase our projected benefit obligation as of september 30 2011 by approximately 13 million 

legal contingencies 

we are periodically subject to various legal claims and involved in various legal proceedings we routinely review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any matter is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we record a liability for the estimated loss significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether the amount of an exposure is reasonably estimable because of inherent uncertainties related to these legal matters we base our loss accruals on the best information available at the time further estimates of this nature are highly subjective and the final outcome of these matters could vary significantly from the amounts that have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as additional information becomes available we reassess our potential liability and may revise our estimates such revisions could have a material impact on future quarterly or annual results of operations 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

 

 we invest our cash with highly rated financial institutions and in diversified domestic and international money market mutual funds the portfolio is invested in shortterm instruments to ensure cash is available to meet requirements as needed 

2011 compared to 2010 

the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to the resolution as previously disclosed of a litigation matter in japan which reduced our cash balance by approximately 48 million in the first quarter of 2011 including 521 million paid to settle the matter and the timing of cash collections on accounts receivable described below in addition in 2011 net cash outflows related to compensation accruals were higher than 2010 due primarily to our full achievement of performancebased and incentive cash plan targets in 2010 paid in 2011 while such targets were only partially achieved in 2009 paid in 2010 

accounts receivable was 2302 million 1693 million and 1666 million at september 30 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively the increase in accounts receivable at the end of 2011 as compared to 2010 is due primarily to revenue in the fourth quarter of 2011 being 713 million higher than in the fourth quarter of 2010 cash collections on accounts receivable remained strong with days sales outstanding of 62 days as of september 30 2011 compared to 57 days as of september 30 2010 

we periodically provide financing to creditworthy customers with payment terms up to 24 months other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets include noncurrent receivables from customers related to extended payment term contracts totaling 171 million at both september 30 2011 and 2010 

cash paid for income taxes was 281 million 343 million and 556 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

2010 compared to 2009 

the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to 

 

  

  

 these increases were partially offset by 2009 benefitting from cash collections of 2008 accounts receivable which totaled 2015 million as of september 30 2008 cash collections on accounts receivable were strong with days sales outstanding of 57 days as of the end of 2010 compared to 62 days as of the end of 2009 other assets in the consolidated balance sheets included noncurrent receivables from customers related to extended payment term contracts totaling 171 million and 105 million at september 30 2010 and 2009 respectively which negatively impacted our cash flows from operating activities in 2010 by 66 million 

  

cash used by investing activities 

 

 in 2011 we acquired mks for an aggregate purchase price of 298 million 2652 million net of cash acquired and completed several smaller acquisitions in each year shown our expenditures for property and equipment consist primarily of computer equipment software office equipment and facility improvements 

cash provided used by financing activities 

 

 the increase in proceeds from issuance of common stock was due to higher stock option exercises in 2011 19 million options compared to 2010 15 million options and 2009 06 million options as of september 30 2011 we had approximately 30 million stock options outstanding including 01 million shares granted in connection with our acquisition of mks these options expire on various dates through 2017 including 12 million in 2012 08 million in 2013 and 09 million in 2014 we expect substantially all of the options including those held by our executives to be exercised prior to their respective expiration dates 

share repurchase authorization 

our board of directors has periodically authorized us to repurchase shares of our common stock under our current authorization they have authorized us to repurchase up to 100 million worth of shares with cash from operations in the period october 1 2011 through september 30 2012 in 2011 we repurchased 26 million shares at a cost of 549 million in 2010 and 2009 we repurchased 37 million shares at a cost of 625 million and 12 million shares at a cost of 142 million respectively all shares of our common stock repurchased are automatically restored to the status of authorized and unissued future repurchases of shares will reduce our cash balances 

credit facility 

we have a revolving credit facility with a bank syndicate under which we may borrow funds up to 300 million with an accordion feature that allows us to borrow up to an additional 150 million if the existing or additional lenders agree repay the same in whole or in part and reborrow at any time through september 30 2016 when all amounts outstanding will be due and payable in full 

  

in 2011 in connection with our acquisition of mks we borrowed 250 million under the credit facility 50 million of which we repaid in the fourth quarter of 2011 as of september 30 2011 we had 200 million outstanding under the revolving credit facility in october 2011 we borrowed an additional 40 million under the revolving credit facility for shortterm cash requirements including the payment of fiscal 2011 incentive compensation 

the credit facility limits ptc’s and its subsidiaries’ ability to among other things incur additional indebtedness incur liens or guarantee obligations pay dividends other than to ptc and make other distributions make investments and enter into joint ventures dispose of assets and engage in transactions with affiliates except on an armslength basis under the credit facility ptc and its material domestic subsidiaries may not invest cash or property in or loan to ptc’s foreign subsidiaries in aggregate amounts exceeding 50 million for any purpose and an additional 75 million for acquisitions of businesses in addition under the credit facility ptc and its subsidiaries must maintain the following financial ratios 

 

  

 as of september 30 2011 our leverage ratio was 085 to 100 and our fixed charge coverage ratio was 308 to 100 we were in compliance with all financial and operating covenants of the credit facility as of september 30 2011 

in 2010 and 2009 we repaid revolving credit facility borrowings of 508 million and 320 million respectively which was the remaining balance of 220 million we had borrowed in the first quarter of 2008 in connection with our acquisition of cocreate 

for a description of additional terms and conditions of the credit facility including limitations on our ability to undertake certain actions see note h long term debt in the “notes to consolidated financial statements” of this annual report 

expectations for fiscal 2012 

we believe that existing cash and cash equivalents together with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements through at least the next twelve months and to meet our known longterm capital requirements in addition we expect to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in 2012 to repurchase 55 million worth of shares of our common stock and to repay amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility to achieve a balance of 100 million outstanding as of september 30 2012 capital expenditures in 2012 are currently anticipated to be approximately 31 million 

we have evaluated and expect to continue to evaluate possible strategic transactions on an ongoing basis and at any given time may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to possible strategic transactions our expected uses of cash could change our cash position could be reduced and we may incur additional debt obligations to the extent we complete any significant acquisitions 

at september 30 2011 we had cash and cash equivalents of 790 million in europe 267 million in the united states 367 million in the pacific rim including india 133 million in japan and 122 million in other nonus countries as of september 30 2011 we had an outstanding intercompany loan receivable of 3345 million primarily resulting from our business reorganizations described in income taxes above owed to the us from our top tier foreign subsidiary this amount can be repaid with cash generated by our foreign subsidiaries and repatriated to the us without future tax cost 

  

contractual obligations 

at september 30 2011 our contractual obligations were as follows 

 

  

    as of september 30 2011 we had letters of credit and bank guarantees outstanding of approximately 38 million of which 11 million was collateralized primarily related to our corporate headquarters lease in needham massachusetts 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have not created and are not party to any specialpurpose or offbalance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital incurring debt or operating parts of our business that are not consolidated to the extent of our ownership interest therein into our financial statements we have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby we have subordinated retained interests derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks contingent liabilities or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing liquidity market risk or credit risk support to us

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend we face exposure to financial market risks including adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 

foreign currency exchange risk 

our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to canada western european countries china and japan we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates that arise from receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies we do not enter into or hold foreign currency derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes nor do we enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge future cash flow or forecasted transactions 

our nonus revenues generally are transacted through our nonus subsidiaries and typically are denominated in their local currency in addition our nonus expenses that are incurred by our nonus subsidiaries typically are denominated in their local currency approximately 65 63 and 64 of our total revenue was from sales to customers outside of the united states in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively approximately 52 49 and 52 of our total expenses were incurred by our subsidiaries domiciled outside of the united states in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations arises in part from intercompany transactions with most intercompany transactions occurring between a us dollar functional currency entity and a foreign currency denominated entity intercompany transactions typically are denominated in the local currency of the nonus dollar functional currency subsidiary in order to centralize foreign currency risk also both ptc the parent company and our nonus subsidiaries may transact business with our customers and vendors in a currency other than their functional currency transaction risk in addition we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results and balances of our nonus subsidiaries are translated into us dollars translation risk if sales to customers outside of the united states increase our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could increase 

our foreign currency risk management strategy is principally designed to mitigate the future potential financial impact of changes in the us dollar value of balances denominated in foreign currency resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates our foreign currency hedging program uses forward contracts to manage the foreign currency exposures that exist as part of our ongoing business operations the contracts primarily are denominated in canadian dollars and european currencies and have maturities of less than three months 

generally we do not designate foreign currency forward contracts as hedges for accounting purposes and changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized immediately in earnings because we enter into forward contracts only as an economic hedge any gain or loss on the underlying foreigndenominated balance would be offset by the loss or gain on the forward contract gains and losses on forward contracts and foreign denominated receivables and payables are included in foreign currency net losses 

  

as of september 30 2011 and 2010 we had outstanding forward contracts with notional amounts equivalent to the following 

 

 debt 

as of september 30 2011 the amount outstanding under our variablerate revolving credit facility was 2000 million this loan is subject to interest rate risk as interest rates will be adjusted at each rollover date to the extent such amounts are not repaid as of september 30 2011 the annual rate is 16875 which will reset on november 22 2011 at which time accrued interest is due and the interest rate will reset to then current rates as defined in the loan agreement if there was a hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates the annual net impact to earnings and cash flows would be 20 million this hypothetical change in cash flows and earnings has been calculated based on the borrowings outstanding at september 30 2011 and a 100 basis point per annum change in interest rate applied over a oneyear period 

cash and cash equivalents 

as of september 30 2011 cash equivalents were invested in highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased we invest our cash with highly rated financial institutions in north america europe and asiapacific and in diversified domestic and international money market mutual funds at september 30 2011 we had cash and cash equivalents of 790 million in europe 267 million in the united states 367 million in the pacific rim including india 133 million in japan and 122 million in other nonus countries given the short maturities and investment grade quality of the portfolio holdings at september 30 2011 a hypothetical 10 change in interest rates would not materially affect the fair value of our cash and cash equivalents 

our invested cash is subject to interest rate fluctuations and for nonus operations foreign currency risk in a declining interest rate environment we would experience a decrease in interest income the opposite holds true in a rising interest rate environment over the past several years the us federal reserve board european central bank and bank of england have changed certain benchmark interest rates which have led to declines and increases in market interest rates these changes in market interest rates have resulted in fluctuations in interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents interest income will continue to fluctuate based on changes in market interest rates and levels of cash available for investment our consolidated cash balances were impacted favorably by 64 million and 38 million in 2011 and 2009 respectively and unfavorably by 13 million in 2010 due to changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar particularly the euro and the japanese yen

 item 9a controls and procedures tableend evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

our management maintains disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the exchange act is processed recorded summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer our principal executive officer and principal financial officer respectively as appropriate to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

as required by sec rule 13a15b we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of management including our principal executive and principal financial officers of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this annual report based on this evaluation we concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of september 30 2011 

management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f of the exchange act as a process designed by or under the supervision of our principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by our board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that 

 

  

  

 because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of september 30 2011 using the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal controlintegrated framework  based on this assessment and those criteria our management concluded that as of september 30 2011 our internal control over financial reporting was effective management excluded mks from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of september 30 2011 because it was acquired by us in a business combination during the third quarter of 2011 mks’s total assets and total revenue represented less than 2 and 3 respectively of our related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended september 30 2011 

  

the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of september 30 2011 has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which appears under item 8 

change in internal control over financial reporting 

there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act that occurred during the quarter ended september 30 2011 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

competition 

we compete primarily in the product development market including the plm market and the cax market we compete with a number of companies that offer solutions that address specific functional areas covered by our solutions including dassault systemes sa and siemens ag for traditional cax solutions plm solutions manufacturing planning solutions and visualization and digital mockup solutions and oracle corporation for plm solutions in addition we compete with sap ag which offers a plm solution that controls product data within the larger framework of its enterprise resource planning solution we believe our plm solutions are more specifically targeted toward the product development processes within manufacturing companies and offer broader and deeper functionality for those processes than erpbased solutions 

we also compete in the cax market with design products such as autodesk inc’s inventor siemens ag’s solid edge and dassault systemes sa’s solidworks for sales to smaller manufacturing customers 

proprietary rights 

our software products and related technical knowhow along with our trademarks including our company names product names and logos are proprietary we protect our intellectual property rights in these items by relying on copyrights trademarks patents and common law safeguards including trade secret protection the nature and extent of such legal protection depends in part on the type of intellectual property right and the relevant jurisdiction in the us we are generally able to maintain our trademark registrations for as long as the marks are in use and our patents for up to 20 years from the earliest effective filing date we also use license management and other antipiracy technology measures as well as contractual restrictions to curtail the unauthorized use and distribution of our products 

our proprietary rights are subject to risks and uncertainties described under item 1a “risk factors” below you should read that discussion which is incorporated into this section by reference 

  

backlog 

we generally ship our products within 30 days after receipt of a customer order a high percentage of our license revenue historically has been generated in the third month of each fiscal quarter and this revenue tends to be concentrated in the later part of that month accordingly orders may exist at the end of a quarter that have not been shipped and not been recognized as revenue we do not believe that our backlog at any particular point in time is indicative of future sales levels 

employees 

as of september 30 2010 we had 5317 employees including 1914 in product development 1521 in customer support training and consulting 1347 in sales and marketing and 535 in general and administration of these employees 1956 were located in the united states and 3361 were located outside the united states

 item 1a risk factors tableend the following are important factors we have identified that could affect our future results you should consider them carefully when evaluating forwardlooking statements made by us including those contained in this annual report because these factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in forwardlooking statements the risks described below are not the only risks we face additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business financial condition andor operating results 

i operational considerations 

our operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter making future operating results difficult to predict 

our quarterly operating results historically have fluctuated and are likely to continue to fluctuate depending on a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 accordingly our quarterly results are difficult to predict prior to the end of the quarter and we may be unable to confirm or adjust expectations with respect to our operating results for a particular quarter until that quarter has closed any failure to meet our quarterly revenue or earnings targets could adversely impact the market price of our stock 

weakness in the united states and international economies may continue to adversely affect our business 

the past two years have been characterized by weak global economic conditions a tightening in the credit markets reduced liquidity and extreme volatility in many financial markets we experienced a significant decline in license revenue in 2009 in all geographic regions in which we operate as customers reduced or deferred purchases of our products and services the steep declines in license revenue in 2009 adversely impacted our maintenance and services revenues in 2010 although these conditions seem to be improving with license revenue 39 higher in 2010 as compared to 2009 but still 11 lower than 2008 it is uncertain whether a sustainable recovery is currently taking place on a worldwide basis and these adverse conditions may unfavorably impact our business financial results and financial condition 

competition is intensifying which may reduce our profits and limit or reduce our market share 

the market for product development solutions is rapidly changing and is increasingly competitive we expect competition to intensify which could result in price reductions for our products and services reduced margins and loss of market share our primary competition comes from 

 

   

 

  

 the cax market is characterized by intense competition for customers however the nature of this market which is relatively mature and whose growth has slowed and the number and nature of the competitive products which have increasingly similar functionality make it difficult to gain new customers moreover decreasing product differentiation and the training data conversion and other startup costs associated with system replacement make it more difficult to dislodge incumbent design systems 

we must continually modify and enhance our products to keep pace with changing technology and address our customers’ needs and expectations and any failure to do so could reduce demand for our products 

our ability to remain competitive will depend on our ability to enhance our current offerings and develop new products and services that keep pace with technological developments and meet evolving customer requirements through 

 

  

  

 in addition our solutions must meet customer expectations to be successful especially with respect to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 if our solutions fail to meet customer expectations customers may discontinue adoption of our solutions resulting in a loss of potential additional sales and we may be unable to retain existing customers or attract new customers 

our financial condition could be adversely affected if significant errors or defects are found in our software 

sophisticated software can sometimes contain errors defects or other performance problems if errors or defects are discovered in our current or future products we may need to expend significant financial technical and management resources or divert some of our development resources in order to resolve or work around those defects and we may not be able to correct them in a timely manner or provide an adequate response to our customers 

errors defects or other performance problems in our products could cause us to delay new product releases or customer deployments any such delays could cause delays in our ability to realize revenue from the licensing and shipment of new or enhanced products and give our competitors a greater opportunity to market competing 

  

products such difficulties could also cause us to lose customers technical problems or the loss of customers could also damage our business reputation and cause us to lose new business opportunities 

businesses we acquire may not generate the revenue and earnings we anticipated and may otherwise adversely affect our business 

we have acquired and intend to continue to acquire new businesses and technologies if we fail to successfully integrate and manage the businesses and technologies we acquire our operating results may be adversely affected 

moreover business combinations also involve a number of risks and uncertainties that can adversely affect our operations and operating results including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we are dependent on key personnel whose loss could impair our operations our product development or our sales efforts 

our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial technical and sales personnel 

we require highly skilled technical personnel to develop our products competition for such personnel in our industry is intense if we are unable to attract and retain technical personnel with the requisite skills our product development efforts could be delayed which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

our sales efforts rely on having a sufficient number of sales representatives and sales support personnel with the skills and knowledge necessary to sell our products including an ability to educate our customers about our products in order to create and meet demand for our products if we are unable to attract or retain sales and sales support personnel with the requisite expertise our revenue could be adversely affected 

at times we provide extended payment terms to our customers which may be a factor in our customers’ purchasing decisions and our revenues could be adversely affected if we ceased making these terms available 

we have provided extended payment terms to certain customers in connection with transactions we have completed with them providing extended payment terms may positively influence our customers’ purchasing decisions but may reduce our cash flows in the shortterm if we reduce the amount of extended payment terms we provide to customers customers might reduce or defer the amount they spend on our products and services from the amount they might otherwise have spent if extended payment terms were available to them if this were to occur our revenue or revenue growth could be lower than in prior periods andor lower than we expect 

we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights 

our software products and trademarks including our company names product names and logos are proprietary we protect our intellectual property rights in these items by relying on copyrights trademarks 

  

patents and common law safeguards including trade secret protection as well as restrictions on disclosures and transferability contained in our agreements with other parties despite these measures the laws of all relevant jurisdictions may not afford adequate protection to our products and other intellectual property in addition we frequently encounter attempts by individuals and companies to pirate our software solutions if our measures to protect our intellectual property rights fail others may be able to use those rights which could reduce our competitiveness and revenues 

intellectual property infringement claims could be asserted against us which could be expensive to defend and could result in limitations on our use of the claimed intellectual property 

the software industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding copyright patent and other intellectual property rights while we have not had any significant claims of this type asserted against us such claims could be asserted against us in the future if a lawsuit of this type is filed it could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel we cannot be sure that we would prevail against any such asserted claims if we did not prevail we could be prevented from using the claimed intellectual property or required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements which might not be available on terms acceptable to us in addition to possible claims with respect to our proprietary products some of our products contain technology developed by and licensed from third parties and we may likewise be susceptible to infringement claims with respect to these thirdparty technologies 

our sales and operations are globally dispersed which exposes us to additional operating and compliance risks 

we sell and deliver software and services and maintain support operations in a large number of countries whose laws and practices differ from one another north america accounted for 38 europe for 39 and asiapacific for 23 of our revenue in 2010 managing these geographically dispersed operations requires significant attention and resources to ensure compliance with laws accordingly while we maintain a comprehensive compliance program we cannot guarantee that an employee agent or business partner will not act in violation of our policies or us or other applicable laws such violations can lead to civil andor criminal prosecutions substantial fines and the revocation of our rights to continue certain operations and also cause business and reputation loss 

our cost structure is relatively fixed in the short term which makes it difficult to reduce our expenses quickly in response to declines in revenue or revenue growth 

we make expenditures to support our revenue growth in advance of achieving the expected revenue our expenses associated with headcount and facilities can be difficult to reduce quickly due to the nature of those items if revenue does not grow as we expect or if it declines our expenses may constitute a larger percentage of our operating budget than we planned which would adversely affect our profitability 

consulting and training services margins are significantly lower than license and maintenance margins increases in consulting and training services revenue as a percent of total revenue could decrease our overall margins 

because enterprise license solutions generally require more services to implement than desktop license solutions services revenue as a percent of total revenue may increase additionally future projected improvements in our operating margin percent are predicated in part on our ability to improve consulting and training services margins through operating efficiencies leverage and increased use of outside service providers if our services revenue increases as a percentage of total revenue andor if we are unable to improve our services margins our overall operating margin may not increase or may decrease which could adversely impact our stock price 

  

our current research and development efforts may not generate revenue for several years if at all 

developing and localizing software products is expensive and the investment in product development often involves a long return on investment cycle we have made and expect to continue to make significant investments in research and development and related product opportunities that could adversely affect our operating results if not offset by revenue increases we believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position 

our recently announced cad product initiative creo may not generate the revenues we expect 

we are currently developing a new suite of cad solutions creo which we believe will be a significant enhancement over the functionality and usability of existing cad products on the market today and may enhance our longterm revenue growth in the cax market if we are unable to release creo when we expect or if customers do not adopt creo when or at the rate we expect our cad revenues and margins may not increase as expected if at all 

we depend on sales within the discrete manufacturing market and our revenue is likely to decrease if manufacturing activity slows 

a large amount of our revenues are related to sales to customers in the discrete manufacturing sector a decline in general economic or business conditions or a decline in spending in the manufacturing sector or the aerospace and defense industry vertical segments could cause customers to reduce or defer spending on our products which would cause our revenue and earnings to decrease or to grow more slowly 

a significant portion of our revenue is generated from maintenance contracts decreases in maintenance renewal rates or a decrease in the number of new licenses we sell would negatively impact our future maintenance revenue and operating results 

a substantial portion of our maintenance revenue is derived from maintenance contracts these contracts are generally renewed on an annual basis and typically have a high rate of customer renewal in addition to the recurring revenue base associated with these contracts a majority of customers purchasing new perpetual licenses also purchase related annual maintenance contracts if the rate of renewal for these contracts or the level of maintenance revenue associated with new licenses is adversely affected by economic or other factors our maintenance revenue growth and profitability will be adversely affected 

we may have exposure to additional tax liabilities and our effective tax rate may increase or fluctuate which could increase our income tax expense and reduce our net income 

as a multinational organization we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes in the us and in various foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision and other tax liabilities in the ordinary course of a global business there are many intercompany transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain our tax returns are subject to review by various taxing authorities although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable there is no assurance that the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 

our effective tax rate can be adversely affected by several factors many of which are outside of our control including 

 

  

  

   

  

  

 ii other considerations 

we have a revolving credit facility and may incur debt under that facility 

we entered into a new credit facility in august 2010 under the terms of our credit facility we may borrow up to 300 million with an accordion feature that allows us to borrow up to an additional 150 million if the existing or additional lenders agree repay the same in whole or in part and reborrow at any time through august 22 2014 when any amounts outstanding will be due and payable in full we have not drawn on the facility but we may borrow amounts under the credit facility in the future to support our operations including for strategic acquisitions 

in addition we are required to comply with specified financial and operating covenants which limit our ability to operate our business as we otherwise might operate it our failure to comply with any of these covenants or to meet any payment obligations under the facility could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived would result in any amounts outstanding including any accrued interest and unpaid fees becoming immediately due and payable we might not have sufficient working capital or liquidity to satisfy any repayment obligations in the event of an acceleration of those obligations in addition if we are not in compliance with the financial and operating covenants at the time we wish to borrow funds we will be unable to borrow funds 

our stock price has been volatile which may make it harder to resell your shares at a time and at a price that is favorable to you 

market prices for securities of software companies are generally volatile and are subject to significant fluctuations unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies the trading prices and valuations of these stocks and of ours may not be predictable negative changes in the public’s perception of the prospects of software companies or of ptc or the markets we serve could depress our stock price regardless of our operating results 

also a large percentage of our common stock is held by institutional investors purchases and sales of our common stock by these institutional investors could have a significant impact on the market price of the stock for more information about those investors please see our proxy statement with respect to our most recent annual meeting of stockholders and schedules 13d and 13g filed with the sec with respect to our common stock

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend we have been defending two separate lawsuits filed by ge japan corporation formerly ge capital leasing corporation “gej” the first lawsuit was filed against ptc on august 2 2007 in the us district court for the district of massachusetts that lawsuit alleged that gej was fraudulently induced to provide financing in japan to toshiba corporation for purchases of third party products predominantly ptc products during the period from 2003 to 2006 and that ptc participated in the alleged scheme or alternatively should have been aware of the scheme and made negligent misrepresentations that enabled the scheme to continue undetected gej’s complaint claimed damages of 47 million and sought three times that amount plus attorneys’ fees 

a second lawsuit was filed against ptc japan kk ptj on january 7 2009 in tokyo district court in japan the second lawsuit arose from the same underlying transactions as the massachusetts lawsuit the second lawsuit sought damages of 58 billion yen plus interest of 5 per year on such amount since april 27 2007 and costs of the lawsuit 

on october 20 2010 we entered into an agreement with gej to resolve gej’s claims against us in connection with the resolution we made a cash payment in the first quarter of 2011 to gej in return for which gej withdrew all claims against ptc and ptcj and gej assigned to ptc and ptcj certain rights of recovery against third parties neither party admitted any liability to the other the resolution of this litigation will reduce our cash balance by approximately 48 million in the first quarter of 2011 

we also are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business we currently believe that resolving these other matters will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations

executive overview 

the principal highlights of our performance for 2010 compared to 2009 were 

 

  

  

  

  

 revenue operating margin earnings per share and cash flow 

the following table shows the financial measures that we consider the most significant indicators of the performance of our business in addition to providing operating income operating margin and diluted earnings per share as calculated under generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” we provide nongaap operating income operating margin and diluted earnings per share for the reported periods these measures exclude stockbased compensation amortization of acquired intangible assets expense restructuring charges inprocess research and development expenses onetime gains or charges included in nonoperating other income expense and the related tax effects of the preceding items and any one–time tax items excluding those expenses and onetime items provides investors another view of our operating results which is aligned with management budgets and with performance criteria in our incentive compensation plans management uses and investors should use nongaap measures in conjunction with our gaap results we discuss the nongaap measures in detail under “income and margins earnings per share” below 

  

  

 2010 compared to 2009 

the increase in license revenue in 2010 was primarily driven by a 73 increase in plm license revenue due primarily to sales of our primary plm product—windchill—to large customers we believe the 39 increase in license revenue in 2010 compared with 2009 reflects an improved macroeconomic climate with customers resuming investments in important business process and information technology initiatives additionally we believe our plm license revenue results demonstrate that our windchill plm platform is achieving a technology leadership position in the plm market maintenance and consulting and training service revenue in 2010 were both negatively impacted by our weak license sales in 2009 however this revenue grew modestly in the second half of 2010 compared to the second half of 2009 which we view as a sign that the adverse effect of weak license sales in 2009 may be ending 

our gaap and nongaap operating income increased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily because of the increase in license revenue 

costs and expenses in 2010 compared to 2009 increased primarily due to 

 

  

  

  

 these cost increases were partially offset by the impact of headcount reductions made in the third and fourth quarters of 2009 and related restructuring charges recorded in gaap operating income in 2009 

while operating income increased significantly in 2010 compared to 2009 gaap diluted earnings per share decreased in 2010 compared to 2009 due to a significantly higher income tax rate in 2010 our tax rate was 70 in 2010 compared to a benefit of 84 in 2009 due in part to the onetime tax items described in the table above 

  

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates continue to impact our business at foreign currency exchange rates consistent with the comparable periods of 2009 reported revenue in 2010 would have been lower by approximately 155 million and reported expenses would have been lower by approximately 115 million which would have resulted in a net decrease in 2010 operating income of approximately 4 million for 2010 

cash flow from operating activities was 157 million in 2010 compared with 70 million in 2009 in addition to 27 million of capital expenditures we used 63 million to repurchase shares of our common stock and 51 million to repay the remaining amount outstanding on our revolving credit facility our balance sheet remained strong with 240 million of cash and cash equivalents and 300 million available under our revolving credit facility as of september 30 2010 the resolution of litigation described in part i item 3“ legal proceedings ” will reduce our cash balance by approximately 48 million in the first quarter of 2011 

2009 compared to 2008 

results in 2009 compared to 2008 were driven by the adverse global economic environment resulting in a sharp decline in license revenue economic conditions and the decline in license revenue also had a negative impact on our consulting and training services revenue and maintenance revenue in the second half of 2009 additionally in 2009 the value of certain nonus currencies in which we transact business particularly the euro declined relative to the us dollar this adversely affected reported revenue by 39 million and favorably impacted our reported costs and expenses by 41 million as amounts earned in these currencies are translated into dollars for reporting purposes while the impact on reported revenue and expenses was significant the net impact on operating income was not significant 

primarily as a result of the revenue decline our operating income declined by 106 million in 2009 net income declined by 48 million in 2009 primarily due to lower operating income partially offset by a decrease of 54 million in our income tax provision over the same period 

as a result of lower revenue and operating income we took actions beginning in the second quarter of 2009 that reduced or contained our operating costs including 

 

  

  

  

 although we took these actions to reduce costs we chose to make investments in research and development in 2009 in support of strategic product development initiatives 

fiscal year 2011 expectations strategies and risks 

the past two years have been characterized by weak global economic conditions a tightening in the credit markets and extreme volatility in many financial markets which have adversely impacted it spending although these conditions seem to be improving it is uncertain whether a sustainable recovery is currently taking place on a worldwide basis and these adverse conditions may continue to unfavorably impact our business financial results and financial condition however we are encouraged by our financial results in 2010 although 2010 revenue was lower than 2008 our results reflect a significant improvement over the decline we saw in 2009 particularly with respect to plm license sales which in 2010 were higher than both 2009 and 2008 based on 2010 results improvements in the global economy and our strong relative position among competing plm products we expect revenue to grow 10 to 12 in 2011 we expect continued strong license growth at 20 to 25 in 2011 and we expect that our license revenue growth in 2010 and continued expected growth in 2011 will 

  

result in maintenance and services revenue growth in 2011 our revenue and operating results may continue to be impacted by currency fluctuations 

if the economy does not continue to improve or if the economies of countries in europe or asiapacific are slower to recover than we expect customers particularly small and medium size businesses may continue to delay reduce or forego technology purchases additionally our results have become increasingly dependent on adoption of our plm solutions among large direct customers sales of these solutions have been relatively large in average size and may have long lead times as they often follow a lengthy product selection and evaluation process this may cause increased volatility in our results 

balancing an improving but still uncertain economic climate with the longerterm opportunity for the business we are modestly increasing investments in our business that we believe are critical to delivering value to our customers and will help us gain market share drive faster top line growth and improve operating profitability over the longer term these investments include 

 

  

  

 we may reduce or delay these strategic investments andor take actions to reduce our operating costs if revenue is lower than we expect in addition these investments may not deliver the results we expect 

results of operations 

impact of foreign currency exchange on results of operations 

approximately two thirds of our revenue and half of our expenses are transacted in currencies other than the us dollar currency translation affects our reported results because we report our results of operations in us dollars on a yearoveryear comparative basis our revenue for 2010 benefited as a result of changes in currency exchange rates primarily the euro and the japanese yen and our expenses were also higher conversely in 2009 our revenue and expenses were lower as a result of changes in currency rates if actual reported results were converted into us dollars based on the corresponding prior year’s foreign currency exchange rates 2010 revenue and expenses would have been lower by 155 million and 115 million respectively and 2009 revenue and expenses would have been higher by 385 million and 410 million respectively the net impact on yearoveryear results would have been a decrease in operating income of 40 million in 2010 and 25 million in 2009 the results of operations revenue by line of business and revenue by geographic region in the tables that follow present both actual percentage changes year over year and percentage changes on a constant currency basis 

revenue 

our revenue consists of software license revenue and service revenue service revenue includes software maintenance revenue consisting of providing our customers software updates and technical support as well as consulting and training revenue including implementation services 

explanatory note about a change in our revenue reporting 

in the first quarter of 2010 we began reporting revenue by product groupings—desktop and enterprise—and by distribution channel—direct and indirect 

desktop revenue includes our cax solutions creo elementspro formerly proengineer creo elementsdirect formerly cocreate mathcad and arbortext authoring products enterprise revenue includes 

  

our plm solutions windchill arbortext enterprise products creo elementsview formerly productview   relex and insight these definitions of desktop and enterprise are not the same as those used when we last reported these revenue categories in our sec filings for the period ended september 30 2007 or periods before that date 

direct revenue includes sales made primarily by our direct sales force to large businesses indirect revenue includes sales by our reseller channel primarily to small and mediumsize businesses as well as revenue from other accounts that we have classified as indirect if the classification of a customer changes between direct and indirect we reclassify the historical revenue associated with that customer to align with the current period classification such reclassifications were not material 

  

revenue by product group and distribution channel 

 

  

   

 revenue by line of business 

 

  

   

our revenue growth in 2010 compared to 2009 reflects improved economic conditions particularly in north america and china license revenue grew in both our direct and indirect distribution channels maintenance and consulting and training services revenue declined in 2010 compared to 2009 however in the fourth quarter of 2010 both grew year over year and sequentially which we believe is an indication that the decline we attributed to the weak license sales in 2009 has ended 

revenue for 2009 compared to 2008 was impacted by the adverse global economic environment and unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates in most foreign currencies in which we do business while our maintenance and services businesses performed well in the first half of 2009 economic conditions and declines in license revenue had a negative impact on our maintenance and service businesses in the second half of 2009 

license revenue 

2010 compared to 2009 

the growth in license revenue in 2010 compared to 2009 reflects increases of 73 653 million in enterprise license revenue and 15 180 million in desktop license revenue the growth in enterprise license revenue was driven by sales of windchill which were 72 504 million higher in 2010 than 2009 the increase in desktop license revenue in 2010 compared to 2009 was due primarily to an increase of 28 150 million in sales of new proengineer licenses license revenue was favorably impacted by 23 million in 2010 as a result of foreign currency exchange rate movements 

2009 compared to 2008 

license revenue in 2009 decreased year over year in every region and across most of our major product families license revenue in north america europe and asiapacific declined 14 143 million 49 636 million and 42 417 million respectively license revenue in 2009 was unfavorably impacted by approximately 72 million due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements 

maintenance revenue 

maintenance revenue represents revenue from renewals of seats under maintenance and maintenance on new seat licenses 

2010 compared to 2009 

our maintenance revenue in 2010 was down 1 compared to 2009 while maintenance revenue in 2010 continued to be adversely impacted by the global economic climate and soft license sales in 2009 it was favorably impacted by 92 million as a result of foreign currency exchange rate movements desktop maintenance revenue decreased 3 106 million in 2010 and enterprise maintenance revenue increased 6 79 million in 2010 proengineer and windchill seats under maintenance increased 3 and 32 respectively as of the end of 2010 compared to the end of 2009 

2009 compared to 2008 

in 2009 our maintenance revenue was adversely impacted by the global economic climate and significant declines in license revenue this resulted in a decrease in maintenance revenue particularly in the second half of 2009 desktop maintenance revenue was down 2 82 million and enterprise maintenance revenue was up 5 63 million the decline in maintenance revenue in 2009 reflected a 1 decrease in seats under maintenance as of the end of 2009 compared to the end of 2008 including a 2 decrease in proengineer seats and a 1 decrease in windchill seats maintenance revenue in 2009 includes 107 million more cocreate 

  

maintenance revenue than 2008 due to the fact that 2008 results included only 10 months of cocreate revenue whereas 2009 included a full year of cocreate revenue maintenance revenue in 2009 was unfavorably impacted by 190 million as a result of foreign currency exchange rate movements 

consulting and training revenue 

one of our strategic initiatives is to continue to expand our services ecosystem by adding strategic services partners to focus on smaller engagements enabling us to focus on larger engagements 

2010 compared to 2009 

consulting and training services engagements typically result from sales of new licenses particularly of our enterprise solutions accordingly weak license sales in 2009 had an adverse impact on services revenue in the first half of 2010 toward the end of 2010 our consulting and training revenue began to stabilize with consulting and training revenue in the fourth quarter of 2010 increasing 5 year over year and 1 sequentially total consulting revenue which is primarily related to windchill implementations was down 3 in 2010 total training revenue which typically represents about 15 of our total consulting and training services revenue was down 11 in 2010 direct enterprise consulting and training service revenue which comprised over 75 of our total consulting and training service revenue in 2010 and 2009 was flat in 2010 

consulting and training services revenue in 2010 was favorably impacted by 39 million as a result of foreign currency exchange rate movements 

2009 compared to 2008 

the decrease in consulting and training service revenue reflects a 16 63 million decline in training revenue and a 2 43 million decline in consulting services revenue due to the adverse impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements of 124 million consulting services revenue in 2009 reflects a 15 80 million decrease in asiapacific offset by a 5 40 million increase in europe 

revenue by distribution channel 

direct 

our direct revenue was 72 70 and 69 of our total revenue in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively the increase in direct revenue in 2010 compared to 2009 was driven by 20 growth in direct enterprise revenue this increase was partially offset by a decrease of 2 in direct desktop revenue in 2010 compared to 2009 the decrease in direct revenue in 2009 reflected declines of 15 and 6 in desktop and enterprise revenue respectively 

indirect 

we have over 420 geographically dispersed resellers that focus on sales to small and mediumsize businesses this enables our direct sales force to focus on larger sales opportunities and ensures greater coverage of all customer segments historically our resellers have focused primarily on selling our desktop products in 2009 we began developing a network of resellers to sell our enterprise products and we continued these efforts in 2010 

our indirect revenue was 28 30 and 31 of our total revenue in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively indirect revenue was up 3 in 2010 compared to 2009 reflecting increases in indirect desktop and enterprise revenue of 2 and 8 respectively we believe that this performance reflects challenging but improving macroeconomic conditions indirect desktop and enterprise revenue both declined by 17 from 2008 to 2009 

  

we believe that the markets for desktop and enterprise solutions served by our indirect channel continue to offer longterm growth potential however while we have achieved growth in 2010 compared to 2009 these markets continue to be impacted by ongoing uncertain macroeconomic conditions and we expect them to recover at a slower pace than our direct business 

revenue from individual customers 

we enter into customer contracts that may result in revenue being recognized over multiple reporting periods accordingly revenue recognized in a current period may be attributable to contracts entered into during the current period or in prior periods license andor consulting and training service revenue of 1 million or more recognized from individual customers in a single quarter during the fiscal year from contracts entered into during that quarter andor a prior quarter is shown in the table below the amount of revenue particularly license revenue attributable to large transactions and the number of such transactions may vary significantly from quarter to quarter based on customer purchasing decisions and macroeconomic conditions 

the increase in 2010 was due primarily to the sale of enterprise products to large direct customers the decline in this revenue in 2009 was primarily declines in license revenue which we believe was due to the unfavorable macroeconomic environment 

 

 revenue by geographic region 

data for the years ended september 30 2009 and 2008 includes immaterial reclassifications between geographic regions to conform to the current year classification 

 

 revenue by region as a  of total revenue 

 

 all geographic regions were impacted by the adverse global macroeconomic environment in 2009 we began to see recovery in north america in the second half of 2009 and throughout 2010 we also have begun to 

  

see recovery in europe and asiapacific we believe the asiapacific region particularly china continues to present an important growth opportunity because global manufacturing companies have continued to invest in that region and the market in that region for both our plm solutions and mcad solutions is relatively unsaturated 

americas 

2010 compared to 2009 

the yearoveryear changes in revenue in the americas were primarily driven by changes in license revenue license revenue increased 33 290 million in 2010 compared to 2009 driven by sales of enterprise products to direct customers our direct revenue increased 14 382 million and our indirect revenue declined 6 42 million in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily related to maintenance revenue 

2009 compared to 2008

pacific rim 

2010 compared to 2009 

the increase in revenue in the pacific rim in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily due to an increase of 44 188 million in license revenue additionally maintenance revenue increased 9 30 million revenue from customers in china which represents a significant portion of our pacific rim revenue increased 24 compared to 2009 our direct revenue increased 16 127 million and our indirect revenue increased 32 91 million in 2010 compared to 2009 revenue in the pacific rim in 2010 was favorably impacted by 27 million due to the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates

japan 

2010 compared to 2009 

revenue in japan in 2010 compared to 2009 reflects an increase of 29 45 million in license revenue partially offset by declines in maintenance revenue of 3 21 million and in consulting and training service revenue of 14 25 million our direct revenue declined 3 20 million and our indirect revenue increased 5 20 million in 2010 compared to 2009 revenue in japan in 2010 was favorably impacted by 65 million due to the impact of changes in the yen to us dollar exchange rate

costs and expenses 

 

  

 2010 compared to 2009 

costs and expenses in 2010 increased by 115 million as a result of foreign currency exchange rate movements if actual reported results were converted into us dollars based on the corresponding prior year’s foreign currency exchange rates 2010 expenses would have been 9238 million 

headcount was 5317 at september 30 2010 compared to 5165 at september 30 2009 the net increase in headcount was primarily due to 

 

  

   

costs and expenses in 2010 compared to 2009 reflect higher costs due to 

 

  

  

 total costs and expenses in 2010 compared to 2009 reflect a 131 million increase in commissions due to higher license sales and a 192 million increase in incentivebased compensation due primarily to performancebased incentive plan targets which were fully achieved in 2010 while such targets were not achieved in full in 2009 

2009 compared to 2008 

costs and expenses in 2009 decreased primarily as a result of foreign currency exchange rate movements 410 million if actual reported results were converted into us dollars based on the corresponding prior year’s foreign currency exchange rates 2009 expenses would have been 9599 million 

headcount was 5165 at september 30 2009 compared to 5087 at september 30 2008 the net increase in headcount was primarily due to 

 

  

  

 these increases in headcount were offset by the effects of our cost reduction and containment measures undertaken in the second third and fourth quarters of 2009 

total costs and expenses in 2009 compared to 2008 reflect an 116 million decrease in commissions due to lower license sales and a 60 million decrease in performancebased compensation as our 2009 performancebased plans were not earned in full 

cost of license revenue 

 

 our cost of license revenue consists of fixed and variable costs associated with reproducing and distributing software and documentation as well as royalties paid to third parties for technology embedded in or licensed with our software products cost of license revenue as a percent of license revenue can vary depending on product mix sold the effect of fixed and variable royalties and the level of amortization of acquired software intangible assets amortization of acquired purchased software totaled 184 million 197 million and 199 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively cost of license revenue as a percentage of total license revenue was lower in 2010 and 2008 as compared to 2009 due primarily to license revenue fluctuations 

  

cost of service revenue 

 

 our cost of service revenue includes costs associated with consulting training and customer support personnel such as salaries and related costs thirdparty subcontractor fees costs associated with the release of maintenance updates including related royalty costs and facility costs service margins can vary based on the product mix sold in the period margins on maintenance revenue are significantly higher than on consulting and training service revenue maintenance revenue comprised 70 69 and 68 of total service revenue in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

total compensation benefit costs and travel expenses were 4 72 million higher in 2010 compared to 2009 the cost of thirdparty consulting services was 67 million lower in 2010 compared 2009 due to the decrease in consulting and training services in 2010 services headcount was up due to hiring to support planned revenue growth 

cost of service revenue was lower in 2009 compared to 2008 due to total compensation including salaries commissions bonuses and stockbased compensation benefits and travel costs which were 100 million lower and the costs for thirdparty consulting services which were 78 million lower due to decreases in consulting and training services yearend headcount for 2009 reflected cost reduction actions taken in 2009 

sales and marketing 

 

 our sales and marketing expenses primarily include salaries and benefits sales commissions advertising and marketing programs travel and facility costs our compensation benefit costs and travel expenses were higher by an aggregate of 141 million in 2010 compared to 2009 these costs increased primarily due to commissions which were higher by 138 million due to more license sales in 2010 than in 2009 in addition expenses were higher by 23 million related to our annual sales incentive meeting for 2010 which was cancelled in 2009 while yearend headcount was up year over year average sales and marketing headcount decreased 4 in 2010 compared to 2009 

our compensation benefits and travel expenses were lower by an aggregate of 78 million in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to commissions which were lower by 94 million as a result of lower revenue in addition expenses were lower by 26 million as a result of our decision to cancel the 2009 annual sales incentive meeting 

research and development 

 

   

our research and development expenses consist principally of salaries and benefits costs of computer equipment and facility expenses major research and development activities include developing new releases of our software we increased headcount in 2009 particularly in the third quarter to support our strategic decision to increase our investment in research and development including development of our core products while yearend headcount decreased 1 from 2009 to 2010 average headcount increased 3 in 2010 compared to 2009 as a result of this increased investment total compensation benefit costs and travel expenses were higher in 2010 compared to 2009 by an aggregate of 128 million including a 63 million increase in cash incentive plan and stockbased compensation 

total compensation benefits and travel costs were higher in 2009 by 09 million compared to 2008 primarily due to higher salaries and benefits as a result of higher research and development headcount these salary increases were partially offset by a decrease of 31 million in total cashbased incentive compensation expense as the performance criteria under our incentive plans were not achieved in full 

general and administrative 

 

 our general and administrative ga expenses include the costs of our corporate finance information technology human resources legal and administrative functions as well as bad debt expense ga expenses also include costs associated with outside professional services including accounting and legal fees total compensation benefit costs and travel costs were higher in 2010 compared to 2009 by an aggregate of 97 million due primarily to an 80 million increase in cash incentive plan and stockbased compensation expense the increase was due primarily to performancebased cash incentive plan targets which were fully achieved in 2010 while such targets were not achieved in full in 2009 as well as to grants of fiscal 2010 stockbased awards being made in november 2009 our usual timing while the 2009 stockbased awards were not made until the third quarter of 2009 because we had insufficient shares available under the 2000 equity incentive plan earlier in the year 

total compensation benefits and travel costs were lower in 2009 compared to 2008 by an aggregate of 20 million including a decrease of 11 million in cashbased incentive compensation expense as the performance criteria under our incentive plans were not achieved in full ga expenses also include costs associated with outside professional services including accounting and legal fees these costs were 29 million lower in 2009 primarily because 2008 included approximately 28 million of costs for outside professional services incurred in connection with an audit committee investigation and restatement of prior period financial statements completed in the first quarter of 2008 

amortization of acquired intangible assets 

 

 the amortization of acquired intangible assets line item on our statements of operations reflects the amortization of acquired nonproduct related intangible assets primarily customer and trademarkrelated intangible assets recorded in connection with completed acquisitions 

  

inprocess research and development 

 

 inprocess research and development costs are related to acquired research and development projects that were in process at the respective acquisition date and for which technological feasibility had not yet been established and for which there was no alternative future use the value of the purchased inprocess research and development was determined using the residual income approach which discounts expected future cash flows from projects under development to their net present value the inprocess research and development charge in 2009 was from our relex acquisition and in 2008 was from our cocreate and dhi acquisitions all development projects have been completed 

restructuring and other charges 

 

 restructuring charges in the periods reported were primarily associated with reductions in workforce and excess facility obligations to reduce our cost structure and to improve profitability 

given the challenging macroeconomic environment and lower revenue we implemented workforce reductions and facility consolidations beginning in the second quarter of 2009 the 2009 restructuring charges included 219 million for severance and related costs associated with 382 employees notified of termination during 2009 and 08 million of charges related to excess facilities 

the 2008 charge included 107 million for severance and related costs associated with 185 employees notified of termination during 2008 as a result of our initiative to globalize certain functions to be in closer proximity to the operations they support andor to move certain functions to lower cost regions the 2008 charge also included 79 million of costs related to excess facilities in 2008 we also recorded 15 million for costs incurred in connection with our integration of cocreate 

in 2010 2009 and 2008 we made cash payments related to restructuring and other charges including payments relating to restructuring and other charges recorded prior to 2008 of 145 million 247 million and 251 million respectively amounts not yet paid at september 30 2010 relating to restructuring and other charges taken during prior periods were 12 million and relate to excess facilities of the total amount accrued at september 30 2010 we expect to make cash disbursements within the next twelve months of approximately 05 million for restructuring charges 

nonoperating income expense 

 

   

gain on litigation resolution 

as described in part i item 3 “legal proceedings” in october 2010 we resolved the litigation brought against us by ge japan as a result of the resolution of this matter with ge japan we recorded a onetime gain of 90 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 the amount paid in the first quarter of 2011 to resolve this matter was included in accrued litigation on our balance sheet as of september 30 2010 the resolution of this litigation will reduce our cash balance by approximately 48 million in the first quarter of 2011 

interest income 

interest income represents earnings on the investment of our available cash balances the decrease in interest income in 2010 compared to 2009 is primarily due to lower interest rates resulting in less interest earned on cash balances interest income decreased in 2009 as a result of lower interest rates and lower cash balances 

interest expense 

interest expense is primarily related to interest on borrowings under our revolving credit facility in 2008 we borrowed 220 million under the credit facility in connection with our acquisition of cocreate as of september 30 2010 we had repaid all amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility the decrease in interest expense in 2010 compared to 2009 is due to lower average borrowings and lower interest rates resulting in less interest incurred on amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility the average interest rate was 16 32 and 55 in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

other expense net 

other expense net includes costs of hedging contracts certain realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains or losses and foreign exchange gains or losses resulting from the required periodend currency remeasurement of the assets and liabilities of our subsidiaries that use the us dollar as their functional currency because a large portion of our revenue and expenses is transacted in foreign currencies we engage in hedging transactions involving the use of foreign currency forward contracts primarily in western european and asian currencies to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates net gains and losses on foreign currency exposures including realized and unrealized gains and losses on forward contracts included in other income expense net were net losses of 29 million 36 million and 29 million for 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively other expense net in 2008 also included a 62 million noncash loss relating to the liquidation of eight whollyowned subsidiaries partially offset by a onetime benefit of 13 million related to a legal settlement the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for 2008 reflects an offsetting gain of 62 million resulting from the reclassification 

income taxes 

our effective income tax rate has fluctuated significantly in each of the past three years in 2010 and 2009 this was due primarily to the impact of discrete events which created a onetime income tax provision in 2010 and a onetime income tax benefit in 2009 these are described further below 

 

 in 2010 our effective income tax rate differed from the 35 statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a onetime tax charge of 434 million recorded as a result of a business reorganization partially offset by 

  

foreign taxes at a net effective income tax rate lower than the us rate during the fourth quarter of 2010 we completed a reorganization of our legal entity structure to support our tax and cash planning the objective of this reorganization was to enable significant redeployment and repatriation of cash between our international and domestic operations this reorganization resulted in 446 million of foreign source taxable gain in the us which was offset by foreign tax credits primarily generated as a result of this transaction and carry forward credits available a significant amount of these carry forward credits were previously unrecognized due to the uncertainty of generating foreign source income in the us the net tax effect of this reorganization was a 434 million tax provision in the us while this reorganization resulted in a onetime increase in our tax rate of 53 it has no material effect on cash taxes paid and as a result was excluded from our nongaap earnings per share see income and margins earnings per share below our 2010 tax provision reflects a 60 million provision related to a research and development rd cost sharing prepayment by a foreign subsidiary to the us this prepayment had no impact on our 2010 tax rate as the same prepayment was made in 2009 as described below 

in 2009 our effective income tax rate differed from the 35 statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to 

 

  

  

  

 in 2008 our effective income tax rate of 33 was lower than the 35 statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to the benefit of foreign taxes paid at a net effective income tax rate lower than that in the us 

excluding the effect of these discrete items our income tax provision benefit in 2010 2009 and 2008 consisted primarily of taxes owed in relation to the income generated and withholding taxes that we incurred in the us in connection with certain foreign operations in both 2009 and 2010 we were able to fully benefit withholding taxes incurred in the us 

as of september 30 2010 we have a remaining valuation allowance of 149 million against net deferred tax assets in the us and a remaining valuation allowance of 256 million against net deferred tax assets in certain foreign jurisdictions the valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets in the us consists of 58 million for foreign tax credits 90 million for research and development credits that we have determined are not likely to be realized and 01 million for certain state net operating loss carryforwards that will likely expire without being utilized the valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets of certain foreign jurisdictions is established primarily for our net operating loss carryforwards the majority of which do not expire there are limitations imposed on the utilization of such net operating losses that could further restrict the recognition of any tax benefits 

as of september 30 2010 we have a net deferred tax asset balance of 1035 million primarily relating to our us operations we have concluded based on the weight of available evidence that our net deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized in the future in arriving at this conclusion we evaluated all available evidence including our cumulative profitability on a pretax basis for the last three years adjusted for permanent differences and improving profitability forecasts for the us operations we will continue to reassess our valuation allowance requirements each financial reporting period 

in the normal course of business ptc and its subsidiaries are examined by various taxing authorities including the internal revenue service irs in the united states we regularly assess the likelihood of 

  

additional assessments by tax authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate we are currently under audit by tax authorities in several foreign jurisdictions audits by tax authorities typically involve examination of the deductibility of certain permanent items limitations on net operating losses and tax credits although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in material changes in our estimates in 2009 we closed the irs examination of ptc’s us federal tax years 2005 through 2007 the completion of the examination resulted in a decrease of 94 million to the tax reserve and a net tax benefit of 03 million we also settled a foreign tax audit in the fourth quarter of 2009 resulting in a tax benefit of 22 million in 2007 we recorded a net tax benefit of 39 million from the favorable outcome of a tax refund claim in the us 

our future effective income tax rate may be materially impacted by the amount of income taxes associated with our foreign earnings which are taxed at rates different from the us federal statutory income tax rate as well as the timing and extent of the realization of deferred tax assets and changes in the tax law further our tax rate may fluctuate within a fiscal year including from quarter to quarter due to items arising from discrete events including settlements of tax audits and assessments the resolution or identification of tax position uncertainties and acquisitions of other companies 

income and margins earnings per share 

our gaap and nongaap operating income net income operating margins and earnings per share are shown in the table below the fluctuations in our gaap and nongaap operating income net income and operating margins between 2008 and 2010 were primarily due to fluctuations in our license revenue which was impacted by the adverse global economic conditions throughout 2009 and into 2010 license revenue was 296 million in 2010 213 million in 2009 and 332 million in 2008 our gaap and nongaap operating income net income and operating margins were highest in 2008 lowest in 2009 during the global economic crisis and have improved in 2010 

gaap diluted earnings per share of 020 in 2010 included a onetime tax provision of 434 million an impact of 036 on gaap diluted earnings per share in connection with a legal entity reorganization described in “income taxes” above gaap diluted earnings per share of 027 in 2009 included a onetime tax benefit of 76 million benefitting gaap diluted earnings per share by 006 in connection with litigation in a foreign jurisdiction 

the nongaap measures presented in the foregoing discussion of our results of operations and the respective most directly comparable gaap measures are 

 

  

  

  

 the nongaap measures exclude stockbased compensation amortization of acquired intangible assets expense restructuring charges inprocess research and development expenses onetime gains or charges included in nonoperating other income expense and the related tax effects of the preceding items and any one–time tax items these expenses and charges are normally included in the comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with gaap our management excludes these costs when evaluating our ongoing performance andor predicting our earnings trends and therefore excludes these charges when presenting nongaap financial measures management uses and investors should consider nongaap measures in conjunction with our gaap results 

stockbased compensation expense is noncash expense relating to stockbased awards issued to executive officers employees and outside directors consisting of restricted stock restricted stock units and restricted stock units with performancebased vesting 

  

amortization of acquired intangible assets expense and inprocess research and development are noncash expenses that are impacted by the timing and magnitude of our acquisitions we believe the assessment of our operations excluding these costs is relevant to our assessment of internal operations and comparisons to the performance of other companies in our industry 

restructuring charges include excess facility and assetrelated restructuring charges and severance costs resulting from reductions of personnel driven by modifications to our business strategy and not as part of our normal operations these costs may vary in size based on our restructuring plan in addition our assumptions are continually reevaluated which may increase or reduce the charges in a specific period 

we use these nongaap measures and we believe that they assist our investors to make periodtoperiod comparisons of our operational performance because they provide a view of our operating results without items that are not in our view indicative of our core operating results we believe that these nongaap measures help illustrate underlying trends in our business and we use the measures to establish budgets and operational goals communicated internally and externally for managing our business and evaluating our performance we believe that providing nongaap measures affords investors a view of our operating results that may be more easily compared to the results of peer companies in addition compensation of our executives is based in part on the performance of our business based on these nongaap measures 

the items excluded from the nongaap measures often have a material impact on our financial results and such items often recur accordingly the nongaap measures included in this annual report should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for or superior to the comparable measures prepared in accordance with gaap 

the following tables reconcile each of these nongaap measures to its most closely comparable gaap measure on our financial statements

      critical accounting policies and estimates 

we have prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america in preparing our financial statements we make estimates assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our reported revenues results of operations and net income as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet these estimates assumptions and judgments are necessary because future events and their effects on our results and the value of our assets cannot be determined with certainty and are made based on our historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances these estimates may change as new events occur or additional information is obtained and we may periodically be faced with uncertainties the outcomes of which are not within our control and may not be known for a prolonged period of time 

  

the accounting policies methods and estimates used to prepare our financial statements are described generally in note b of “notes to consolidated financial statements” the most important accounting judgments and estimates that we made in preparing the financial statements involved 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 a critical accounting policy is one that is both material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires us to make difficult subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate and different estimates that we could have used or changes in the estimates that are reasonably likely to occur may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process actual results could differ from those estimates 

accounting policies guidelines and interpretations related to our critical accounting policies and estimates are generally subject to numerous sources of authoritative guidance and are often reexamined by accounting standards rule makers and regulators these rule makers andor regulators may promulgate interpretations guidance or regulations that may result in changes to our accounting policies which could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 

revenue recognition 

we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with determining the amounts of software license and services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period 

our primary judgments involve the following 

 

  

  

  

 we derive revenues from three primary sources 1 software licenses 2 maintenance services and 3 consulting and training services revenue by type for 2010 2009 and 2008 was as follows 

 

   

for software license arrangements that do not require significant modification or customization of the underlying software we recognize revenue when 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 2 delivery has occurred generally fob shipping point or electronic distribution 3 the fee is fixed or determinable and 4 collection is probable substantially all of our license revenues are recognized in this manner 

our software is distributed primarily through our direct sales force in addition we have an indirect distribution channel through alliances with resellers and for our mathcad products with distributors revenue arrangements with resellers are recognized on a sellthrough basis that is when we deliver the product to the enduser customer we record consideration given to a reseller as a reduction of revenue to the extent we have recorded revenue from the reseller we do not offer contractual rights of return stock balancing or price protection to our resellers and actual product returns from them have been insignificant to date as a result we do not maintain reserves for reseller product returns in contrast revenue arrangements with distributors of our mathcad products have a contractual right to exchange product and are recognized on a sellin basis that is when we ship the products to the distributor as of september 30 2010 2009 and 2008 the value of mathcad product inventory held by distributors and the accrual that we have recorded for estimated product returns were not material 

at the time of each sale transaction we must make an assessment of the collectability of the amount due from the customer revenue is only recognized at that time if management deems that collection is probable in making this assessment we consider customer creditworthiness and historical payment experience at that same time we assess whether fees are fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties in assessing whether the fee is fixed or determinable we consider the payment terms of the transaction including transactions with payment terms that extend beyond our customary payment terms and our collection experience in similar transactions without making concessions among other factors we have periodically provided financing to creditworthy customers with payment terms up to 36 months if the fee is determined not to be fixed or determinable revenue is recognized only as payments become due from the customer provided that all other revenue recognition criteria are met our software license arrangements generally do not include customer acceptance provisions however if an arrangement includes an acceptance provision we record revenue only upon the earlier of 1 receipt of written acceptance from the customer or 2 expiration of the acceptance period 

our software arrangements often include implementation and consulting services that are sold under consulting engagement contracts or as part of the software license arrangement when we determine that such services are not essential to the functionality of the licensed software we record revenue separately for the license and service elements of these arrangements provided that appropriate evidence of fair value exists for the undelivered services see discussion below when consulting service qualifies for separate accounting consulting revenues under time and materials billing arrangements are recognized as the services are performed consulting revenues under fixedpriced contracts are generally recognized using the percentageofcompletion method generally we consider that a service is not essential to the functionality of the software based on various factors including if the services may be provided by independent third parties experienced in providing such consulting and implementation in coordination with dedicated customer personnel and whether the services result in any modification or customization of the software functionality if an arrangement does not qualify for separate accounting of the license and service elements then license revenue is recognized together with the consulting services using the percentageofcompletion method of contract accounting under the percentageofcompletion method we estimate the stage of completion of contracts with fixed or “not to exceed” fees based on hours or costs incurred to date as compared with estimated total project hours or costs at completion adjustments to estimates to complete are made in the periods in which facts resulting in a change become known when total cost estimates exceed revenues we accrue for the estimated losses when identified the use of the percentageofcompletion method of accounting requires significant judgment relative to estimating total contract hours or costs including assumptions relative to the length of time to complete the project the nature and complexity of the work to be performed and anticipated changes in salaries and other costs 

  

we generally use the residual method to recognize revenue from software arrangements that include one or more elements to be delivered at a future date when evidence of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists under the residual method the fair value of the undelivered elements ie maintenance consulting and training services based on vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe is deferred and the remaining portion of the total arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements ie software license if evidence of the fair value of one or more of the undelivered services does not exist all revenues are deferred and recognized when delivery of all of those services has occurred or when fair values can be established we determine vsoe of the fair value of services revenue based upon our recent pricing for those services when sold separately for certain transactions vsoe of the fair value of maintenance services is determined based on a substantive maintenance renewal clause within a customer contract our current pricing practices are influenced primarily by product type purchase volume and customer location we review services sold separately on a periodic basis and update when appropriate our vsoe of fair value for such services to ensure that it reflects our recent pricing experience 

for subscriptionbased licenses license revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement in limited circumstances where the right to use the software license is contingent upon current payments of maintenance fees for software license and maintenance are recognized ratably over the initial maintenance term 

maintenance services generally include rights to unspecified upgrades when and if available telephone and internetbased support updates and bug fixes maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract on a straightline basis 

reimbursements of outofpocket expenditures incurred in connection with providing consulting services are included in services revenue with the offsetting expense recorded in cost of service revenue 

training services include onsite and classroom training training revenues are recognized as the related training services are provided 

accounting for income taxes 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to calculate our income tax expense based on taxable income by jurisdiction there are many transactions and calculations about which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain as a result our calculations involve estimates by management some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenuesharing costreimbursement and transfer pricing arrangements among related entities and the differing tax treatment of revenue and cost items across various jurisdictions if we were compelled to revise or to account differently for our arrangements that revision could affect our tax liability 

the income tax accounting process also involves estimating our actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheets we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized we must establish a valuation allowance as a charge to income tax expense 

as of september 30 2010 we have a remaining valuation allowance of 149 million against net deferred tax assets in the us and a remaining valuation allowance of 256 million against net deferred tax assets in certain foreign jurisdictions the valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets in the us consists of 58 million for foreign tax credits 90 million for research and development credits that we have determined are not likely to be realized and 01 million for certain state net operating loss carryforwards that will likely expire without being utilized the valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets of certain foreign jurisdictions is established primarily for our net operating loss carryforwards the majority of which do not expire there are limitations imposed on the utilization of such net operating losses that could further restrict the recognition of any tax benefits 

  

at september 30 2010 we have a net deferred tax asset balance of 1035 million primarily relating to our us operations we have concluded based on the weight of available evidence that our net deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized in the future in arriving at this conclusion we evaluated all available evidence including our cumulative profitability on a pretax basis for the last three years adjusted for permanent differences and improving profitability forecasts for the us operations we will continue to reassess our valuation allowance requirements each financial reporting period 

in the normal course of business ptc and its subsidiaries are examined by various taxing authorities including the internal revenue service irs in the united states we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate we are currently under audit by tax authorities in several foreign jurisdictions audits by tax authorities typically involve examination of the deductibility of certain permanent items limitations on net operating losses and tax credits although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in material changes in our estimates 

valuation of assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations 

in accordance with business combination accounting we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and inprocess research and development based on their estimated fair values determining these fair values requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets 

our identifiable intangible assets acquired consist of developed technology core technology tradenames customer lists and contracts software support agreements and related relationships and consulting contracts developed technology consists of products that have reached technological feasibility core technology represents a combination of processes inventions and trade secrets related to the design and development of acquired products customer lists and contracts and software support agreements and related relationships represent the underlying relationships and agreements with customers of the acquired company’s installed base we have generally valued intangible assets using a discounted cash flow model critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to 

 

  

  

  

 in addition we estimate the useful lives of our intangible assets based upon the expected period over which we anticipate generating economic benefits from the related intangible asset 

net tangible assets consist of the fair values of tangible assets less the fair values of assumed liabilities and obligations except for deferred revenues and restructuring reserves net tangible assets were generally valued by us at the respective carrying amounts recorded by the acquired company as we believed that their carrying values approximated their fair values at the acquisition date 

the values assigned to deferred revenue reflect an amount equivalent to the estimated cost plus an appropriate profit margin to perform the services related to the acquired company’s software support contracts restructuring reserves include the severance costs related to terminating the employment of employees of the acquired company planned closure of certain facilities and other costs associated with exiting activities of the acquired company 

  

our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable at that time but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions estimates or actual results 

valuation of goodwill 

our goodwill totaled 4185 million and 4283 million as of september 30 2010 and 2009 respectively 

we assess the impairment of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets on at least an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable factors we consider important on an overall company basis and reportable segment basis as applicable that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results significant changes in our use of the acquired assets or a significant change in the strategy for our business significant negative industry or economic trends a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period or a reduction of our market capitalization relative to net book value 

the goodwill impairment test prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires us to identify reporting units and to determine estimates of the fair values of our reporting units as of the date we test for impairment determining the fair value of our reporting units for the purpose of testing the potential impairment of individual assets and goodwill requires significant judgment by management different judgments could yield different results 

to conduct these tests of goodwill the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value if the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeded its fair value we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value of goodwill and its implied fair value we estimate the fair values of our reporting units using discounted cash flow valuation models those models require estimates of future revenues profits capital expenditures working capital and discount rates for each reporting unit we estimate these amounts by evaluating historical trends current budgets operating plans and industry data we conduct our annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite lived assets as of the end of the third quarter of each fiscal year we completed our annual impairment review as of july 3 2010 and concluded that no impairment charge was required as of that date the estimated fair value of each reporting unit was more than double their respective carrying values revenue growth and operating margin projections are significant assumptions in our analysis adjusting those assumptions by 10 would not have had an impact on the results of our impairment analysis 

for longlived assets and identifiable intangible assets other than goodwill we reassess the recoverability of the asset based on projected undiscounted future cash flows over the asset’s remaining life if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reportable segment below its carrying value when the carrying value of the asset exceeds its undiscounted cash flows we record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset determined using projected discounted future cash flows of the asset 

accounting for pensions 

in the us we sponsor a frozen pension plan covering mostly inactive participants we make several assumptions that are used in calculating the expense and liability of this plan these key assumptions include the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate in selecting the expected longterm rate of return on assets we consider the average future rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits under the pension plan this includes considering the plan’s asset allocations and the expected returns likely to be earned over the life of this plan the discount rate reflects the estimated rate at which an amount that is invested in a portfolio of highquality debt instruments would provide the future cash flows necessary to pay benefits when they come due in addition our actuarial consultants determine the expense 

  

and liabilities of the plan using other assumptions for future experience such as mortality rates the actuarial assumptions used by us may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions or longer or shorter life spans of the participants our actual results could differ materially from those we estimated which could require us to record a greater amount of pension expense in future years in determining our pension cost for 2010 2009 and 2008 we used a discount rate of 550 750 and 625 respectively and an expected return on plan assets of 750 for each year 

certain of our international subsidiaries also sponsor pension plans accounting and reporting for these plans requires the use of countryspecific assumptions for discount rates and expected rates of return on assets we apply a consistent methodology in determining the key assumptions that in addition to future experience assumptions such as mortality rates are used by our actuaries to determine our liability and expense for each of these plans in determining our pension cost for 2010 2009 and 2008 we used weighted average discount rates of 51 57 and 52 respectively and weighted average expected returns on plan assets of 61 62 and 57 respectively 

in 2010 and 2009 our actual return on plan assets was a gain of 77 million and 18 million respectively while in 2008 our return was a loss of 132 million distress in the financial markets has caused among other things extreme volatility in security prices severely diminished liquidity and credit availability rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuation of others if actual returns are below our expected rate of return it will impact the amount and timing of future contributions and expense for these plans 

as of september 30 2010 and 2009 our plans in total were unfunded representing the difference between our projected benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets by 573 million and 484 million respectively the projected benefit obligation as of september 30 2010 was determined using a discount rate of 50 for the us plan and a weighted average discount rate of 40 for our international plans the most sensitive assumptions used in calculating the expense and liability of our pension plans are the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets total net periodic pension cost was 47 million in 2010 and we expect it to be approximately 5 million in 2011 a 50 basis point change to our discount rate and expected return on plan assets assumptions would have changed our pension expense for the year ended september 30 2010 by less than 1 million a 50 basis point decrease in our discount rate assumptions would increase our projected benefit obligation as of september 30 2010 by approximately 12 million 

allowance for doubtful accounts and other receivables 

management judgment is required in assessing the collectability of customer accounts and other receivables for which we generally do not require collateral we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments in determining the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts management specifically analyzes individual accounts receivable historical bad debts customer concentrations customer creditworthiness current economic conditions accounts receivable aging trends and changes in our customer payment terms our customer base consists of large numbers of geographically diverse customers dispersed across many industries and no individual customer comprised more than 10 of our net accounts receivable for any period presented the following table summarizes our accounts receivable and related reserve balances at september 30 2010 and 2009 

 

   

if the financial condition of our customers deteriorated additional allowances might be required resulting in future operating expenses that are not included in the allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of gross accounts receivable varies depending on the level and timing of quarterly revenue as well as the timing of the resolution of specifically reserved doubtful accounts receivable either via collection or writeoff 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

 we invest our cash with highly rated financial institutions and in diversified domestic and international money market mutual funds the portfolio is invested in shortterm instruments to ensure cash is available to meet requirements as needed 

cash provided by operating activities 

2010 compared to 2009 

the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to 

 

  

  

 these increases were partially offset by 2009 benefitting from cash collections of 2008 accounts receivable accounts receivable was 1693 million 1666 million and 2015 million at september 30 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively cash collections on accounts receivable remained strong with days sales outstanding of 57 days as of the end of 2010 compared to 62 days as of the end of 2009 

we have periodically provided financing to creditworthy customers with payment terms up to 36 months other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets include noncurrent receivables from customers related to extended payment term contracts totaling 171 million and 105 million at september 30 2010 and 2009 respectively which negatively impacted our cash flows from operating activities in 2010 by 66 million 

  

2009 compared to 2008 

the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to 

 

  

  

 these uses of cash were partially offset by lower receivables as of september 30 2009 compared to september 30 2008 days sales outstanding was 62 days as of the end of 2009 compared to 61 days as of the end of 2008 

cash used by investing activities 

 

 we completed acquisitions of businesses in each of 2010 2009 and 2008 in 2008 we paid net of cash acquired 2475 million for cocreate our expenditures for property and equipment consist primarily of computer equipment software office equipment and facility improvements 

cash used provided by financing activities 

 

 share repurchase authorization 

our board of directors has authorized us to use up to 200 million of cash from operations to repurchase shares of our common stock in open market purchases this authorization will expire on september 30 2011 unless earlier revoked in 2010 we repurchased 37 million shares at a cost of 625 million leaving 1180 million remaining under our current authorization in 2009 we repurchased 12 million shares and in 2008 we repurchased 17 million shares all shares of our common stock repurchased are automatically restored to the status of authorized and unissued future repurchases of shares will reduce our cash balances 

  

credit facility 

in the fourth quarter of 2010 we entered into a new revolving credit facility with a bank syndicate under which we may borrow funds up to 300 million with an accordion feature that allows us to borrow up to an additional 150 million if the existing or additional lenders agree repay the same in whole or in part and reborrow at any time through august 22 2014 when all amounts outstanding will be due and payable in full in connection with entering into this credit facility we terminated our existing credit facility the prior credit facility under which we could borrow up to 230 million through february 21 2011 

in 2008 in connection with our acquisition of cocreate we borrowed 220 million under the prior credit facility in two tranches 36 million that accrued interest at the eurodollarbased borrowing rate and an alternate currency loan of 1246 million euros equivalent to 184 million at the borrowing date the 36 million loan was repaid in full in 2008 and the euro loan was repaid over the course of 2009 and 2010 as of september 30 2010 we had no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility 

for a description of the terms and conditions of the new credit facility including limitations on our ability to undertake certain actions see “note h commitments and contingencies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10k 

expectations for fiscal 2011 

the resolution of litigation as described in part i item 3 “legal proceedings” will reduce our cash balance by approximately 48 million in the first quarter of 2011 we believe that existing cash and cash equivalents together with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet this litigation payment and to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements through at least the next twelve months 

we expect to continue to repurchase our shares in 2011 capital expenditures are currently anticipated to be approximately 28 million 

we have evaluated and expect to continue to evaluate possible strategic transactions on an ongoing basis and at any given time may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to possible strategic transactions our expected uses of cash could change our cash position could be reduced and we may incur additional debt obligations to the extent we complete any significant acquisitions 

contractual obligations 

at september 30 2010 our contractual obligations are as follows 

 

  

   

    as of september 30 2010 we had letters of credit and bank guarantees outstanding of approximately 47 million of which 10 million was collateralized primarily related to our corporate headquarters lease in needham massachusetts 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have not created and are not party to any specialpurpose or offbalance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital incurring debt or operating parts of our business that are not consolidated to the extent of our ownership interest therein into our financial statements we have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby we have subordinated retained interests derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks contingent liabilities or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing liquidity market risk or credit risk support to us

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend we face exposure to financial market risks including adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 

foreign currency exchange risk 

our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to western european countries and japan we enter into various hedging transactions to manage this risk we do not enter into or hold foreign currency derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

  

our nonus revenues generally are transacted through our nonus subsidiaries and typically are denominated in their local currency in addition our nonus expenses that are incurred by our nonus subsidiaries typically are denominated in their local currency approximately 62 63 and 66 of our total revenue was from sales to customers outside of north america in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively approximately 49 50 and 52 of our total expenses were incurred by our subsidiaries domiciled outside of north america in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations arises in part from intercompany transactions with most intercompany transactions occurring between a us dollar functional currency entity and a foreign currency denominated entity intercompany transactions typically are denominated in the local currency of the nonus subsidiary in order to centralize foreign currency risk also both ptc the parent company and our nonus subsidiaries may transact business with our customers and vendors in a currency other than their functional currency transaction risk in addition we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results and balances of our nonus subsidiaries are translated into us dollars translation risk if sales to customers outside of the united states increase our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could increase 

our foreign currency risk management strategy is principally designed to mitigate the future potential financial impact of changes in the us dollar value of balances denominated in foreign currency resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates our foreign currency hedging program uses forward contracts to manage the foreign currency exposures that exist as part of our ongoing business operations the contracts primarily are denominated in european currencies and have maturities of less than three months 

generally we do not designate foreign currency forward contracts as hedges for accounting purposes and changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized immediately in earnings because we enter into forward contracts only as an economic hedge any gain or loss on the underlying foreigndenominated balance would be offset by the loss or gain on the forward contract gains and losses on forward contracts and foreign denominated receivables and payables are included in other income expense net 

as of september 30 2010 and 2009 we had outstanding forward contracts with notional amounts equivalent to the following 

 

 cash and cash equivalents 

as of september 30 2010 cash equivalents were invested in highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased we invest our cash with highly rated financial institutions in north america europe and asiapacific and in diversified domestic and international money market mutual funds at september 30 2010 we had cash and cash equivalents of 740 million in europe 665 million in the united states 529 million in the pacific rim including india 335 million in japan and 134 million in other nonus countries given the short maturities and investment grade quality of the portfolio holdings at september 30 2010 a hypothetical 10 change in interest rates would not materially affect the fair value of our cash and cash equivalents 

  

our invested cash is subject to interest rate fluctuations and for nonus operations foreign currency risk in a declining interest rate environment we would experience a decrease in interest income the opposite holds true in a rising interest rate environment over the past several years the us federal reserve board european central bank and bank of england have changed certain benchmark interest rates which have led to declines and increases in market interest rates these changes in market interest rates have resulted in fluctuations in interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents interest income will continue to fluctuate based on changes in market interest rates and levels of cash available for investment our consolidated cash balances were impacted unfavorably by 13 million and 40 million in 2010 and 2008 respectively and favorably by 38 million in 2009 by the weakening and strengthening respectively of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar particularly the euro and the japanese yen

 item 1a risk factors tableend the following are important factors we have identified that could affect our future results you should consider them carefully when evaluating forwardlooking statements made by us including those contained in this annual report because these factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in forwardlooking statements the risks described below are not the only risks we face additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business financial condition andor operating results 

i operational considerations 

weakness in the united states and international economies may continue to adversely affect our business 

we experienced a challenging economic environment in 2009 in which customers in all geographic regions in which we operate reduced or deferred purchases of our products and services our license revenue declined 36 from 2008 and our services and maintenance businesses declined in the second half of 2009 as well although there are some indications that the economy in the us has begun to recover the us economy may not recover or may deteriorate further which could continue to adversely affect our operations and results in 2010 the economies of europe and the asia pacific region do not appear to have begun to recover and may remain distressed well into 2010 or longer which will continue to harm our operations and results in 2010 further the steep declines in license revenue in 2009 are likely to adversely impact our maintenance and services revenues in 2010 even if the economy recovers 

competition is intensifying which may reduce our profits and limit or reduce our market share 

the market for product development solutions is rapidly changing and is increasingly competitive we expect competition to intensify which could result in price reductions for our products and services reduced margins and loss of market share our primary competition comes from 

 

  

 the cax market is characterized by intense competition for customers however the nature of this market which is relatively mature and whose growth has slowed and the number and nature of the competitive products which have increasingly similar functionality make it difficult to gain new customers moreover decreasing product differentiation and the training data conversion and other startup costs associated with system replacement make it more difficult to dislodge incumbent design systems 

in addition recent consolidation within the software industry has given rise to new and stronger competitors 

we must continually modify and enhance our products to keep pace with changing technology and address our customers’ needs and expectations and any failure to do so could reduce demand for our products 

our ability to remain competitive will depend on our ability to enhance our current offerings and develop new products and services that keep pace with technological developments and meet evolving customer requirements through 

 

  

  

   

in addition our solutions must meet customer expectations to be successful especially with respect to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 if our solutions fail to meet customer expectations customers may discontinue adoption of our solutions resulting in a loss of potential additional sales and we may be unable to retain existing customers or attract new customers 

businesses we acquire may not generate the revenue and earnings we anticipated 

we have acquired and intend to continue to acquire new businesses and technologies if we fail to successfully integrate and manage the businesses and technologies we acquire our operating results may be adversely affected 

moreover business combinations also involve a number of risks and uncertainties that can adversely affect our operations and operating results including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our financial condition could be adversely affected if significant errors or defects are found in our software 

sophisticated software often contains errors defects or other performance problems when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released as these enhanced versions contain additional programming code and third party sourced functionality that must work across our large product suite if errors or defects are discovered in our current or future products we may need to expend significant financial technical and management resources or divert some of our development resources in order to resolve or work around those defects and we may not be able to correct them in a timely manner or provide an adequate response to our customers 

errors defects or other performance problems in our products could cause us to delay product releases or customer deployments any such delays could cause delays in our ability to realize revenue from the licensing and shipment of new or enhanced products and give our competitors a greater opportunity to market competing 

  

products such difficulties could also cause us to lose customers technical problems or the loss of customers could also damage our business reputation and cause us to lose new business opportunities 

we are dependent on key personnel whose loss could impair our operations our product development or our sales efforts 

our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial technical and sales personnel 

we require highly skilled technical personnel to develop our products competition for such personnel in our industry is intense if we are unable to attract and retain technical personnel with the requisite skills our product development efforts could be delayed which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

our sales efforts rely on having a sufficient number of sales representatives with the skills and knowledge necessary to sell our products including an ability to educate our customers about our products in order to create and meet demand for our products if we are unable to attract or retain sales personnel with the requisite expertise our revenue could be adversely affected 

at times we provide extended payment terms to our customers which may be a factor in our customers’ purchasing decisions and our revenues could be adversely affected if we ceased making these terms available 

we have provided extended payment terms to certain customers in connection with transactions we have completed with them providing extended payment terms may positively influence our customers’ purchasing decisions but may reduce our cash flows in the shortterm if we reduce the amount of extended payment terms we provide to customers customers might reduce or defer the amount they spend on our products and services from the amount they might otherwise have spent if extended payment terms were available to them if this were to occur our revenue or revenue growth could be lower than in prior periods andor lower than we expect 

we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights 

our software products and trademarks including our company names product names and logos are proprietary we protect our intellectual property rights in these items by relying on copyrights trademarks patents and common law safeguards including trade secret protection as well as restrictions on disclosures and transferability contained in our agreements with other parties despite these measures the laws of all relevant jurisdictions may not afford adequate protection to our products and other intellectual property in addition we frequently encounter attempts by individuals and companies to pirate our software solutions if our measures to protect our intellectual property rights fail others may be able to use those rights which could reduce our competitiveness and revenues 

intellectual property infringement claims could be asserted against us which could be expensive to defend and could result in limitations on our use of the claimed intellectual property 

the software industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding copyright patent and other intellectual property rights while we have not had any significant claims of this type asserted against us such claims could be asserted against us in the future if a lawsuit of this type is filed it could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel we cannot be sure that we would prevail against any such asserted claims if we did not prevail we could be prevented from using that intellectual property or required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements which might not be available on terms acceptable to us in addition to possible claims with respect to our proprietary products some of our products contain technology developed by and licensed from third parties and we may likewise be susceptible to infringement claims with respect to these thirdparty technologies 

  

our sales and operations are globally dispersed which exposes us to additional operating and compliance risks 

we sell and deliver software and services and maintain support operations in a large number of countries whose laws and practices differ from one another north america accounted for 37 europe for 40 and asiapacific for 23 of our revenue in 2009 managing these geographically dispersed operations requires significant attention and resources to ensure compliance with laws accordingly while we maintain a comprehensive compliance program we cannot guarantee that an employee agent or business partner will not act in violation of our policies or us or other applicable laws such violations can lead to civil andor criminal prosecutions substantial fines and the revocation of our rights to continue certain operations and also cause both business and reputation loss 

our cost structure is relatively fixed in the short term which makes it difficult to reduce our expenses quickly in response to declines in revenue or revenue growth 

we make expenditures to support our revenue growth in advance of achieving the expected revenue our expenses associated with headcount and facilities can be difficult to reduce quickly due to the nature of those items if revenue does not grow as we expect or if it declines our expenses may constitute a larger percentage of our operating budget than we planned which would adversely affect our profitability 

ii other considerations 

we are currently defending a lawsuit seeking substantial damages in which we could be liable 

on august 2 2007 ge capital leasing corporation now ge financial services corporation “gefs” filed a lawsuit against us in the us district court for the district of massachusetts the lawsuit alleges that gefs was fraudulently induced to provide over 60 million in financing to toshiba corporation for purchases of third party products predominantly ptc products during the period from 2003 to 2006 gefs claims that ptc participated in the alleged scheme or alternatively should have been aware of the scheme and made negligent misrepresentations that enabled the scheme to continue undetected gefs’s complaint claims damages of 47 million and seeks three times that amount plus attorneys’ fees on october 2 2008 the united states district court for the district of massachusetts entered an order granting ptc’s motion to dismiss gefs’s complaint subject to certain conditions including ptc’s agreement to provide certain discovery to gefs and to assent to personal jurisdiction in japan on november 17 2008 gefs filed a motion to vacate the court’s october 2nd order and to seek to continue the case in the us we have opposed gefs’s motion 

on january 7 2009 gefs also filed an action in tokyo district court in japan against ptc’s japanese subsidiary ptc japan kk the lawsuit arises from the same underlying transactions as the massachusetts lawsuit and seeks damages of 5808384889 yen approximately 65 million as of september 30 2009 plus interest of 5 per year on such amount since april 27 2007 and costs of the lawsuit subsequently the tokyo district court consolidated this newly filed action with gefs’s pending action against toshiba and other parties to the transactions which was filed in the tokyo district court in august 2007 in the japanese action gefs alleges that employees of ptc japan committed wrongful acts in cooperation with employees of other companies involved in the transactions including an employee of toshiba who was criminally convicted for obtaining fraudulent loans gefs alleges that the wrongful acts committed by ptc japan employees caused gefs’s damages and that ptc japan as an employer is jointly and severally liable for gefs’s losses along with the other defendants 

we dispute gefs’s claims and are contesting them vigorously as of september 30 2009 and 2008 revenue of 4658162417 yen 519 million and 438 million respectively that was previously recorded for the transactions at issue has been deferred and recorded as customer advances in our consolidated balance sheets that liability will remain recorded until the rights and obligations of the several companies connected with the toshiba transactions are resolved the change in customer advances at september 30 2009 from september 30 

  

2008 is due to foreign currency translation adjustments we have not accrued any other liability for this matter as of september 30 2009 as an amount potentially payable if any is not estimable to the extent that matters are resolved in an amount less than the recorded customer advances liability we will reduce customer advances and record the portion retained to revenue or other income at that time to the extent that matters are resolved in an amount in excess of the recorded customer advances liability we would record expense for the amount due in excess of our recorded liability 

we have a revolving credit facility and may incur additional debt under that facility 

under the terms of our credit facility we may borrow funds up to 230 million repay the same in whole or in part and reborrow at any time through february 20 2011 when all amounts outstanding will be due and payable in full we currently have 58 million outstanding under this facility resulting from our acquisition of cocreate software gmbh in november 2007 we may borrow additional amounts under the credit facility in the future to support our operations including additional strategic acquisitions 

in addition we are required to comply with the required financial and operating covenants which limits our ability to operate our business as we otherwise might operate it our failure to comply with any of these covenants or to meet our payment obligations could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived would result in all amounts outstanding including all accrued interest and unpaid fees becoming immediately due and payable we may not have sufficient working capital or liquidity to satisfy our repayment obligations in the event of an acceleration of those obligations in addition if we are not in compliance with the financial and operating covenants at the time we wish to borrow funds we will be unable to borrow funds or to borrow additional funds 

our operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter which makes it difficult to predict our revenue and operating results and could adversely affect our stock price 

our quarterly operating results historically have fluctuated and are likely to continue to fluctuate depending on a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 accordingly our quarterly results are difficult to predict prior to the end of the quarter and we may be unable to confirm or adjust expectations with respect to our operating results for a particular quarter until that quarter has closed any failure to meet our quarterly revenue or earnings targets could adversely impact the market price of our stock 

  

our stock price has been volatile which may make it harder to resell your shares at a time and at a price that is favorable to you 

market prices for securities of software companies are generally volatile and are subject to significant fluctuations unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies the trading prices and valuations of these stocks and of ours may not be predictable negative changes in the public’s perception of the prospects of software companies or of ptc or the markets we serve could depress our stock price regardless of our results 

also a large percentage of our common stock is held by institutional investors purchases and sales of our common stock by these institutional investors could have a significant impact on the market price of the stock for more information about those investors please see our proxy statement with respect to our most recent annual meeting of stockholders and schedules 13d and 13g filed with the sec with respect to our common stock

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend forwardlooking statements 

statements in this annual report about anticipated financial results and growth as well as about the development of our products and markets are forwardlooking statements that are based on our current plans and assumptions important information about the bases for these plans and assumptions and factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements is contained below and in item 1a “risk factors” of this annual report 

unless otherwise indicated all references to a year reflect our fiscal year that ends on september 30 

executive overview 

the most significant challenge we faced in 2009 was the adverse global economic environment while we have seen recent signs including sequential license growth in the second half of 2009 particularly in north america that cause us to believe the economy may be beginning to stabilize we expect that the economic environment will continue to affect our business at least for the near term and that customers including those of our resellers may continue delaying purchase decisions or reducing the size of their purchases 

another significant factor impacting our 2009 results was the decline in the value of certain nonus currencies in which we transact business particularly the euro relative to the us dollar compared to 2008 this adversely affected revenue by 39 million and favorably impacted our reported costs and expenses by 41 million as amounts earned in these currencies are translated into dollars for reporting purposes while the impact on reported revenue and expenses was significant the net impact on operating income was not significant 

we recorded 938 million of total revenue in 2009 compared to 1070 million in 2008 most significantly this reflects a decrease in license revenue of 36 a decrease of 120 million in 2009 compared to 2008 economic conditions and the decline in license revenue had a negative impact on our consulting and training services revenue and maintenance revenue in the second half of 2009 and may continue to negatively impact such revenue in 2010 

primarily as a result of the revenue decline in 2009 compared to 2008 our operating income declined by 106 million in 2009 net income declined by 48 million in 2009 primarily due to lower operating income partially offset by a decrease of 54 million in our income tax provision over the same period 

as a result of our lowered revenue expectations for 2009 we took actions beginning in the second quarter of 2009 that reduced or contained our operating costs including 

 

  

  

  

 although we took these actions to reduce costs we chose to make investments in research and development in 2009 in support of strategic product development initiatives 

our balance sheet remained strong with 235 million of cash and an additional 172 million available on our revolving credit facility as of september 30 2009 our cash flow from operations was 70 million in 2009 down 152 million from 2008 primarily as a result of lower operating income in 2009 we used 33 million to complete two small acquisitions 32 million to repay a portion of our borrowings under our revolving credit facility and 14 million to repurchase shares of our common stock during 2009 

  

fiscal year 2010 expectations strategies and risks 

we expect that the global economy will improve in fiscal 2010 with recovery in europe and asiapacific lagging recovery in north america we believe that this will result in license revenue growth in 2010 however we expect that the steep license revenue decline we saw in 2009 will continue to adversely impact our maintenance and services businesses as a result we expect maintenance and services revenue in 2010 to be relatively flat with 2009 further our revenue and operating results may continue to be impacted by currency fluctuations 

if economic growth in north america does not improve or if the economies of countries in europe or asiapacific are slower to recover than we expect customers may continue to delay reduce or forego technology purchases this could result in further reductions in sales of our products longer sales cycles slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition 

balancing a continuing difficult economic situation with the longerterm opportunity for the business we are modestly increasing investments in our business that we believe are critical to delivering value to our customers and will help us gain market share drive faster top line growth and improve operating profitability over the longer term these investments include 

 

  

  

 continued macroeconomic pressure or additional declines in revenue beyond that which we expect could cause us to reduce or delay these strategic investments andor take further actions to reduce our operating costs 

we discuss additional factors that may affect our revenue and operating results under item 1a “risk factors “ of this annual report 

results of operations 

explanatory note about a correction in our consolidated statement of cash flows for the nine months ended july 4 2009 

in our consolidated statement of cash flows for the nine months ended july 4 2009 as presented in our quarterly report on form 10q for the period ended july 4 2009 we incorrectly classified 131 million of windfall tax benefits as a cash flow from operating activities rather than as a cash flow from financing activities for the nine months ended july 4 2009 cash provided by operating activities should have been 642 million and cash used by financing activities should have been 301 million this error had no impact on our consolidated balance sheet or statement of operations because the misclassification is not material to our consolidated financial statements the previously filed quarterly report on form 10q for the period ended july 4 2009 will not be amended the corrected consolidated statement of cash flows for the nine months ended july 4 2009 will be included as a comparable period in our quarterly report on form 10q for the period ending july 3 2010 

explanatory note about a change in our revenue reporting 

in the first quarter of 2009 we began classifying revenue from sales of our computerbased training products as license and maintenance revenue to better align our reporting with how these training products are 

  

sold to customers prior to that computerbased training product revenue and maintenance thereon was classified as consulting and training service revenue and included in total service revenue for 2008 162 million of license revenue and 35 million of maintenance revenue has been reclassified from consulting and training service revenue and related costs of 09 million have been reclassified from cost of service to cost of license for 2007 212 million of license revenue and 31 million of maintenance revenue has been reclassified from consulting and training service revenue and related costs of 15 million have been reclassified from cost of service to cost of license this reclassification had no impact on total revenue operating income or net income the amounts below for 2008 and 2007 have been reclassified to conform to the current classification and the discussion below gives effect to this change 

impact of foreign currency exchange on results of operations 

approximately two thirds of our revenue and half of our expenses are transacted in currencies outside of the us because we report our results of operations in us dollars currency translation affects our reported results on a yearoveryear comparative basis our revenues for both 2008 and 2007 benefited as a result of changes in currency exchange rates primarily the euro and the japanese yen conversely our expenses were higher as a result of changes in these rates if actual reported results were converted into us dollars based on the corresponding prior year’s foreign currency exchange rates 2009 revenue would have been higher by 385 million and 2008 revenue would have been lower by 578 million while 2009 expenses would have been higher by 410 million and 2008 expenses would have been lower by 377 million the net impact on yearoveryear results would have been an increase in operating income of 25 million in 2009 and a decrease in operating income of 201 million in 2008 the results of operations revenue by line of business and revenue by geographic region in the tables that follow present both actual percentage changes year over year and percentage changes on a constant currency basis 

impact of reversal of valuation allowance 

net income for 2007 reflects a noncash tax benefit of 589 million recorded in the third quarter of 2007 primarily associated with our reversal of valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets in the us and a foreign jurisdiction 

overview 

the following is a summary of our results of operations for the last three years which includes the results of operations of companies we acquired beginning on their acquisition date 

 

   

2009 compared to 2008 

revenue decreased in 2009 from 2008 primarily due to a decrease in license revenue caused by the adverse economic environment in which customers reduced and delayed purchases and due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on revenue described above 

costs and expenses decreased in 2009 from 2008 primarily due to the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on costs and expenses described above and due to actions taken to reduce our expenses described above in “executive overview” these decreases in costs and expenses were partially offset by higher research and development costs as a result of continuing investments to improve our products 

2008 compared to 2007 

revenue increased in 2008 from 2007 primarily due to revenue from the cocreate business which we acquired in the first quarter of 2008 and the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements as well as organic growth in maintenance and consulting and training service revenue 

costs and expenses increased in 2008 from 2007 primarily due to costs of the cocreate business the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements measured spending increases to support planned revenue growth restructuring charges from our cost reduction and globalization measures and increased amortization of intangible assets and inprocess research and development charges associated with our acquisitions 

refer to “revenue” and “costs and expenses” below for a more detailed discussion 

revenue 

our revenue consists of software license revenue and service revenue service revenue includes software maintenance revenue consisting of providing our customers software updates and technical support as well as consulting and training revenue including implementation services 

 

  

   

revenue results for 2009 reflect weak license sales as customers reduced the amount of their purchases and delayed purchasing decisions in an adverse macroeconomic environment additionally compared to the prior year revenue in 2009 was negatively impacted by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates in most foreign currencies in which we do business while our maintenance and services businesses performed well in the first half of 2009 economic conditions and declines in license revenue had a negative impact on our maintenance and service businesses in the second half of 2009 

revenue growth in 2008 reflects revenue from acquired businesses particularly cocreate which we acquired on november 30 2007 results for 2007 did not include cocreate revenue while results for 2008 included ten months of cocreate revenue 681 million total revenue in 2008 benefited from favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates in foreign currencies in which we do business the increase in revenue in 2008 also reflects organic growth of our windchill solutions and growth in maintenance revenue these increases were partially offset by declines in consulting and training service revenue related to our mcad solutions particularly in north america a portion of this decline was anticipated as we continue to work to improve our operating margins by developing our reseller and partner channel to offer these services to customers directly we also experienced lower than anticipated revenue from our computerbased training products 

license revenue 

2009 compared to 2008 

license revenue in 2009 decreased year over year in every region and across most of our major product families license revenue in north america europe and asiapacific declined 143 million 14 636 million 49 and 417 million 42 respectively overall license revenue in 2009 was unfavorably impacted by approximately 72 million due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements 

2008 compared to 2007 

license revenue in 2008 reflects growth in europe of 274 million 27 partially offset by an 81 million 7 decline in north america and a 39 million 6 decline in the pacific rim growth in license revenue in 2008 was primarily due to sales of cocreate products which contributed 164 million of license revenue and the impact of favorable currency movements changes in currency exchange rates primarily the euro favorably impacted license revenue by 154 million in 2008 

in 2008 proengineer new seat license revenue growth of 6 was offset by a 16 decrease in revenue from proengineer upgrades and modules we believe that our proengineer upgrades and modules license revenue in the first half of 2008 was negatively impacted by the end of the proengineer wildfire 30 product cycle and the launch of proengineer wildfire 40 in january 2008 as customers may have deferred purchases of those items until they have implemented wildfire 40 license sales of our plm products were up 9 in 2008 primarily due to higher sales of windchill pdmlink total windchill license revenue relative to the number of new seats varies quarter to quarter based on the type and volume of seats sold in 2008 we sold proportionately more light user seats which have a lower price than heavy user seats we believe this reflects increased adoption of windchill beyond the engineering organization as heavy user seats are used by engineers while light user seats are used outside the engineering function 

maintenance revenue 

maintenance revenue represents renewals of seats under maintenance and maintenance on new seat licenses in 2009 and 2008 maintenance revenue was impacted by foreign currency exchange rate movements and sales of acquired products primarily cocreate products 

  

2009 compared to 2008 

in 2009 our maintenance revenue was adversely impacted by the global economic climate and significant declines in license revenue this resulted in a decrease in maintenance revenue particularly in the second half of 2009 which we expect may continue in the near term the decline in maintenance revenue in 2009 reflects a 1 decrease in seats under maintenance as of the end of 2009 compared to the end of 2008 including a 2 decrease in proengineer seats and a 1 decrease in windchill seats maintenance revenue in 2009 includes 107 million more cocreate maintenance revenue than 2008 due to the fact that 2008 results included only 10 months of cocreate revenue whereas 2009 included a full year of cocreate revenue maintenance revenue in 2009 was unfavorably impacted by 190 million as a result of foreign currency exchange rate movements 

2008 compared to 2007 

the growth in maintenance revenue in 2008 reflects a 28 increase in seats under maintenance as of the end of 2008 compared to the end of 2007 including a 4 increase in proengineer seats and a 28 increase in windchill seats in addition the growth reflects the addition of cocreate maintenance customers and favorable foreign currency exchange rate movements cocreate maintenance contributed 471 million of revenue in 2008 maintenance revenue in 2008 was favorably impacted by 295 million as a result of foreign currency exchange rate movements 

consulting and training revenue 

significantly reduced yearoveryear license revenue particularly windchill license revenue began to have an adverse impact on services revenue in the third and fourth quarters of 2009 this is due to the fact that new licenses particularly of our plm solutions typically carry new services engagements as well although we have pending service engagements that we expect to perform recent and continuing declines in new licenses sold have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on future services revenue 

one of our strategic initiatives is to continue to expand our services ecosystem by adding strategic services partners who can focus on smaller engagements enabling us to focus on larger engagements this strategy has resulted in a concentration of our services engagements among a smaller number of customers our revenue includes a consulting and training service engagement with a large european customer that has benefited all periods presented 

2009 compared to 2008 

the decrease in consulting and training service revenue reflects a 63 million 16 decline in training revenue and a 43 million 2 decline in consulting services revenue consulting services revenue in 2009 reflects an 80 million 15 decrease in asiapacific offset by a 40 million 5 increase in europe 

2008 compared to 2007 

the increase in consulting and training service revenue reflects an increase in consulting revenue of 176 million 10 and an increase in training revenue of 68 million 21 the increase in consulting and training service revenue in 2008 was primarily the result of continued growth in training services and windchill implementation consulting in europe and asiapacific consulting services revenue in europe and asiapacific was up 123 million 17 and 109 million 26 respectively these increases were partially offset by a 56 million 8 decline in consulting services revenue in north america 

  

revenue from individual customers 

we enter into customer contracts that may result in revenue being recognized over multiple reporting periods accordingly revenue recognized in a current period may be attributable to contracts entered into during the current period or in prior periods license andor consulting and training service revenue of 1 million or more recognized from individual customers in a single quarter during the fiscal year was 1268 million 1652 million and 1553 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively this revenue represented 29 of total license and consulting and training service revenue in 2009 2008 and 2007 the declines in this revenue in 2009 were primarily declines in license revenue which we attribute to the unfavorable macroeconomic environment 

revenue by geographic region 

 

 revenue by region as a  of total revenue 

 

 we believe the asiapacific region particularly china continues to present an important growth opportunity because global manufacturing companies have continued to invest in that region and the market in that region for both our plm solutions and mcad solutions is relatively unsaturated economic growth in the united states slowed in 2008 and macroeconomic conditions deteriorated significantly in the last quarter of 2008 and first half of 2009 in the second half of 2009 we began to see some recovery in north america we expect the recovery to follow in europe followed by asiapacific the europe region has a consulting and training service engagement with a large customer that has benefitted all periods presented 

north america 

2009 compared to 2008 

revenue in north america in 2009 reflects a yearoveryear decline of 143 million 14 in license revenue partially offset by 32 million 2 growth in maintenance revenue our reseller channel revenue declined 7 in north america in 2009 

2008 compared to 2007 

revenue in north america in 2008 reflects yearoveryear declines of 81 million 7 in license revenue and 42 million 5 in consulting and training service revenue offset by 119 million 7 growth in maintenance revenue our reseller channel revenue grew in excess of 12 in north america in 2008 as we continued to increase our use of channel partners 

  

europe 

2009 compared to 2008 

revenue in europe in 2009 reflects yearoveryear declines of 636 million 49 in license revenue and 143 million 6 in maintenance revenue offset by 08 million 1 growth in consulting and training service revenue european revenue in 2009 was unfavorably impacted by foreign currency exchange rate movements particularly with respect to the euro at foreign currency exchange rates consistent with the prior year revenue in 2009 would have been higher by 491 million excluding the impact of currency movements revenue in 2009 reflects a 552 million 43 decline in license revenue partially offset by a 151 million 15 increase in consulting and training services revenue and a 121 million 5 increase in maintenance revenue 

2008 compared to 2007 

revenue in europe included growth in both organic revenue across all lines of business and revenue from acquired products particularly cocreate products organic revenue in europe in 2008 grew 16 and the sale of cocreate products and services in europe contributed 375 million of revenue in 2008 revenue was favorably impacted 449 million by foreign currency exchange rate movements 

asiapacific 

2009 compared to 2008 

revenue in asiapacific in 2009 reflects yearoveryear declines of 141 million 12 in japan and 276 million 20 in the pacific rim the decline in japan’s revenue which comprised 49 of total asiapacific revenue in 2009 consisted of a 226 million decrease in license revenue partially offset by 

 

  

  

 the decline in revenue in the pacific rim primarily consisted of a decrease in license revenue of 192 million and a decrease in consulting and training service revenue of 91 million 

2008 compared to 2007 

revenue in asiapacific in 2008 reflects yearoveryear growth of 116 million 9 in the pacific rim and 208 million 21 growth in japan the increase in revenue in the pacific rim in 2008 was attributable to 19 growth in maintenance revenue and 31 growth in consulting and training service revenue growth in japan was primarily attributable to higher maintenance revenue from acquired products particularly cocreate products revenue from the sale of cocreate products and services in japan contributed 203 million of revenue in 2008 including 138 million of maintenance revenue 

revenue from our reseller channel 

our diverse and geographically dispersed resellers focus on smaller businesses enabling our direct sales force to focus on larger sales opportunities total sales from our reseller channel were 

 

   

the decline in 2009 reflects decreases in all major geographic regions excluding cocreate revenue our channel revenue in 2009 and 2008 was down 16 and up 17 respectively year over year despite the decline in 2009 we expect our channel revenue to comprise a growing percentage of our total revenue as we continue to focus on expanding our use of resellers 

we attribute the revenue increase from our reseller channel in 2008 to our efforts to expand our reseller channel to the success of proengineer wildfire among small and mediumsize businesses and to sales of acquired cocreate arbortext and mathsoft products in 2008 compared to 2007 growth came from all major geographic regions and was the result of organic revenue growth the addition of cocreate channel revenue and the impact of favorable foreign currency exchange rate movements 

costs and expenses 

 

  

 total costs and expenses 

2009 compared to 2008 

costs and expenses in 2009 decreased primarily as a result of foreign currency exchange rate movements 410 million if actual reported results were converted into us dollars based on the corresponding prior year’s foreign currency exchange rates 2009 expenses would have been 9599 million 

headcount was 5165 at september 30 2009 compared to 5087 at september 30 2008 the net increase in headcount was primarily due to 

 

  

  

 these increases in headcount were offset by the effects of our cost reduction and containment measures undertaken in the second third and fourth quarters of 2009 described in “executive overview” above 

  

total costs and expenses in 2009 compared to 2008 reflect an 116 million decrease in commissions due to lower sales and a 60 million decrease in performancebased compensation as our 2009 performancebased plans were not earned in full 

2008 compared to 2007 

total costs and expenses were adversely impacted by foreign currency exchange rates as costs and expenses incurred in europe and asiapacific were translated into us dollars also headcount increased to 5087 at the end of 2008 compared to 4449 at the end of 2007 due in part to acquisitions completed in 2008 and investments to support our business total costs and expenses in 2008 compared to 2007 reflect the following 

 

  

  

  

 cost of license revenue 

 

 our cost of license revenue consists of fixed and variable costs associated with reproducing and distributing software and documentation as well as royalties paid to third parties for technology embedded in or licensed with our software products year over year cost of license revenue as a percentage of license revenue was higher in 2009 due primarily to fixed costs that did not decrease with license revenue declines in 2009 compared to 2008 the increase in cost of license revenue in 2008 compared to 2007 was due primarily to higher amortization of acquired software intangible assets of 125 million primarily attributable to the acquisition of cocreate in 2008 cost of license revenue as a percent of license revenue can vary depending on product mix sold and the effect of fixed and variable royalties and the level of amortization of acquired software intangible assets 

cost of service revenue 

 

 our cost of service revenue includes costs associated with consulting training and customer support personnel such as salaries and related costs thirdparty subcontractor fees costs associated with the release of maintenance updates including related royalty costs and facility costs service margins can vary based on the product mix sold in the period margins on maintenance revenue are significantly higher than on consulting and 

  

training service revenue maintenance revenue comprised 69 and 68 of total service revenue in 2009 and 2008 respectively compared to 66 in 2007 service margins improved in 2009 and 2008 primarily due to a higher mix of maintenance revenue 

cost of service revenue was lower in 2009 compared to 2008 due to total compensation including salaries commissions bonuses and stockbased compensation benefits and travel costs which were 117 million lower and the cost of thirdparty consulting services which was 78 million lower due to decreases in consulting and training services revenue yearend headcount reflects cost reduction actions taken in 2009 

yearend services headcount for 2008 included increases from acquisitions as well as increases in our services delivery capacity in certain regions total salaries commissions benefits and travel costs were higher by an aggregate of 165 million in 2008 compared to 2007 the cost of thirdparty consulting services was 112 million higher in 2008 compared to 2007 due to the use of such services in support of increases in consulting and training services revenue 

sales and marketing 

 

 our sales and marketing expenses primarily include salaries and benefits sales commissions advertising and marketing programs travel and facility costs our compensation benefits and travel expenses were lower by an aggregate of 71 million in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to commissions which were lower by 100 million as a result of lower revenue in addition expenses were lower by 26 million primarily as a result of our decision to cancel the 2009 annual sales incentive meeting our compensation benefits and travel costs were higher by an aggregate of 160 million in 2008 compared to 2007 including an increase of 32 million related to stockbased compensation sales and marketing costs were higher in 2008 due to planned increases including by acquisition in headcount and higher commissions to support increased license and service revenue 

research and development 

 

 our research and development expenses consist principally of salaries and benefits costs of computer equipment and facility expenses major research and development activities include developing new releases of our software yearend headcount includes increased staffing for certain research and development initiatives due to our strategic decision to increase our investment in research and development as well as from acquisitions total compensation benefits and travel costs were higher in 2009 by 14 million compared to 2008 primarily due to higher salaries and benefits as a result of higher research and development headcount these salary increases were partially offset by a decrease of 31 million in total cashbased incentive compensation expense as the performance criteria under our incentive plans were not achieved in full total salaries benefits and travel costs were higher in 2008 compared to 2007 by an aggregate of 166 million including an increase of 22 million related to stockbased compensation 

  

general and administrative 

 

 our general and administrative ga expenses include the costs of our corporate finance information technology human resources legal and administrative functions as well as bad debt expense ga expenses also include costs associated with outside professional services including accounting and legal fees total compensation benefits and travel costs were lower in 2009 compared to 2008 by an aggregate of 20 million including a decrease of 11 million in cashbased incentive compensation expense as the performance criteria under our incentive plans were not achieved in full ga expenses also include costs associated with outside professional services including accounting and legal fees these costs were 29 million lower in 2009 primarily because 2008 included approximately 28 million of costs for outside professional services incurred in connection with an audit committee investigation and restatement of prior period financial statements completed in the first quarter of 2008 

total salaries benefits and travel costs were higher in 2008 compared to 2007 by an aggregate of approximately 59 million our ga expenses in 2008 included approximately 28 million of costs for outside professional services incurred primarily in connection with an audit committee investigation and restatement of prior period financial statements completed in the first quarter our ga expenses in 2007 included costs for outside professional services incurred in connection with our corporate development initiatives including 17 million related to potential acquisitions that did not close additionally ga expenses in 2007 included 11 million for professional fees incurred primarily in connection with the audit committee investigation completed in 2008 described above 

amortization of acquired intangible assets 

 

 the amortization of acquired intangible assets line item on our statements of operations reflects the amortization of acquired nonproduct related intangible assets primarily customer and trademarkrelated intangible assets recorded in connection with completed acquisitions the increase in 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily due to amortization of intangible assets resulting from the cocreate acquisition completed in the first quarter of 2008 

our acquisition of cocreate in the first quarter of 2008 resulted in an increase in acquired intangible assets of 1310 million acquired intangible assets consisted of 725 million of customer relationship intangibles 551 million of purchased software 23 million of trademarks and 11 million of noncompete agreements and other which are being amortized over estimated weighted average useful lives of 11 years 8 years 9 years and 15 years respectively 

  

inprocess research and development 

 

 inprocess research and development costs are related to acquired research and development projects that were in process at the respective acquisition date and for which technological feasibility had not yet been established and for which there was no alternative future use the value of the purchased inprocess research and development was determined using the residual income approach which discounts expected future cash flows from projects under development to their net present value 

the inprocess research and development charge in 2009 was from our relex acquisition in 2008 was from our cocreate and dhi acquisitions and in 2007 was from our nc graphics acquisition 

restructuring and other charges 

 

 restructuring charges in the periods reported were primarily associated with reductions in workforce and excess facility obligations to reduce our cost structure and to improve profitability given the challenging macroeconomic environment and lower revenue we implemented workforce reductions and facility consolidations beginning in the second quarter of 2009 as a result in 2009 we recorded restructuring charges of 227 million the restructuring charges included 219 million for severance and related costs associated with 382 employees notified of termination during 2009 and 08 million of charges related to excess facilities 

the 2008 charge included 107 million for severance and related costs associated with 185 employees notified of termination during 2008 as a result of our initiative to globalize certain functions to be in closer proximity to the operations they support andor to lower cost regions the 2008 charge also included 79 million of costs related to excess facilities in 2008 we also recorded 15 million for costs incurred in connection with our integration of cocreate 

we recorded a restructuring charge of 153 million in 2007 the restructuring charge included a 132 million charge for severance and related costs associated with 262 employees notified of termination in 2007 and 21 million related to excess facilities the charges for excess facilities were primarily related to gross lease commitments in excess of estimated sublease income for excess facilities 

in 2009 2008 and 2007 we made cash payments related to restructuring and other charges including payments relating to restructuring and other charges recorded prior to 2007 of 247 million 251 million and 147 million respectively amounts not yet paid at september 30 2009 relating to restructuring and other charges taken during the current and all prior periods are 158 million and primarily relate to severance of the total amount accrued at september 30 2009 we expect to make cash disbursements within the next twelve months of approximately 15 million for restructuring charges incurred in 2009 and prior periods 

  

nonoperating income expense 

 

 interest income 

interest income represents earnings on the investment of our available cash balances interest income decreased in 2009 as a result of lower interest rates and lower cash balances interest income in 2008 reflects a modest increase in average cash balances over 2007 

interest expense 

interest expense is primarily related to interest on borrowings under our revolving credit facility in 2008 we borrowed 220 million under the credit facility in connection with our acquisition of cocreate the average interest rate was 32 in 2009 compared to 55 in 2008 as of september 30 2009 of the original amount borrowed we had an outstanding balance of 579 million prior to 2008 we did not have any outstanding borrowings under this credit facility 

other expense net 

other expense net includes costs of hedging contracts certain realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains or losses and foreign exchange gains or losses resulting from the required periodend currency remeasurement of the assets and liabilities of our subsidiaries that use the us dollar as their functional currency because a large portion of our revenue and expenses is transacted in foreign currencies we engage in hedging transactions involving the use of foreign currency forward contracts primarily in western european and asian currencies to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates the increase in other expense net in 2008 was due primarily to a 62 million noncash loss described below and higher foreign exchange losses partially offset by a onetime benefit of 13 million related to a legal settlement 

in the third quarter of 2008 we liquidated eight whollyowned subsidiaries resulting in a 62 million noncash loss the noncash loss resulted from the reclassification of the net cumulative translation adjustment from accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings for these liquidated subsidiaries the loss related to these subsidiaries was recorded in other expense net in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for 2008 reflects an offsetting gain of 62 million resulting from the reclassification 

income taxes 

our effective tax rate has fluctuated significantly in each of the past three years due primarily to the impact of discrete events such as the release of a substantial portion of a us valuation allowance and the settlements of tax audits which created onetime income tax benefits in 2009 our effective tax rate was a benefit of 84 on pretax income of 172 million compared to a provision of 33 in 2008 on pretax income of 1189 million and a benefit of 44 in 2007 on pretax income of 997 million 

in 2009 our effective tax rate differed from the 35 statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to 

 

   

  

  

 in 2008 our effective tax rate of 33 was lower than the 35 statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to the benefit of foreign taxes paid at a net effective tax rate lower than that in the us the net tax benefit recorded in 2007 was principally due to a tax benefit of 589 million recorded upon our decision in the third quarter of 2007 to release a substantial portion of the valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets in the us and a foreign jurisdiction as well as a net tax benefit of 39 million recorded in the third quarter of 2007 from the favorable outcome of a tax refund claim in the us 

excluding the effect of these discrete items our income tax benefit provision in 2009 2008 and 2007 consisted primarily of taxes owed in relation to the income generated in the us in 2008 and 2007 and by our foreign subsidiaries as well as withholding taxes that we incurred in the us in connection with certain foreign operations in 2009 we were able to fully benefit withholding taxes incurred in the us 

as of september 30 2009 we have a remaining valuation allowance of 232 million against net deferred tax assets in the us and a remaining valuation allowance of 231 million against net deferred tax assets in certain foreign jurisdictions the valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets in the us consists of 178 million for foreign tax credits 26 million for research and development credits and 27 million for capital losses that we have determined are not likely to be realized and 01 million for certain state net operating loss carryforwards that will likely expire without being utilized the valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets of certain foreign jurisdictions is established primarily for our net operating loss carryforwards that will likely expire without being used 

at september 30 2009 we have a net deferred tax asset balance of 1235 million primarily relating to our us operations we have concluded based on the weight of available evidence that our net deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized in the future in arriving at this conclusion we evaluated all available evidence including our pretax results for the last three years adjusted for permanent differences the circumstances of a pretax loss generated in the us in the most recent fiscal year and our forecast of future taxable income we reassess our valuation allowance requirements each financial reporting period if our results in 2010 do not improve in our us operations our assessment may indicate that a valuation allowance is required 

in the normal course of business ptc and its subsidiaries are examined by various taxing authorities including the internal revenue service irs in the united states we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate we are currently under audit by tax authorities in several foreign jurisdictions audits by tax authorities typically involve examination of the deductibility of certain permanent items limitations on net operating losses and tax credits although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in material changes in our estimates in 2009 we closed the irs examination of ptc’s us federal tax years 2005 through 2007 the completion of the examination resulted in a decrease of 94 million to the tax reserve and a net tax benefit of 03 million we also settled a foreign tax audit in the fourth quarter of 2009 resulting in a tax benefit of 22 million in 2007 we recorded a net tax benefit of 39 million from the favorable outcome of a tax refund claim in the us 

our future effective tax rate may be materially impacted by the amount of income taxes associated with our foreign earnings which are taxed at rates different from the us federal statutory rate as well as the timing and extent of the realization of deferred tax assets and changes in the tax law further our tax rate may fluctuate 

  

within a fiscal year including from quarter to quarter due to items arising from discrete events including settlements of tax audits and assessments the resolution or identification of tax position uncertainties and acquisitions of other companies 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we have prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america in preparing our financial statements we make estimates assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our reported revenues results of operations and net income as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet these estimates assumptions and judgments are necessary because future events and their effects on our results and the value of our assets cannot be determined with certainty and are made based on our historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances these estimates may change as new events occur or additional information is obtained and we may periodically be faced with uncertainties the outcomes of which are not within our control and may not be known for a prolonged period of time 

the accounting policies methods and estimates used to prepare our financial statements are described generally in note b of “notes to consolidated financial statements” the most important critical accounting judgments and estimates that we made in preparing the financial statements involved 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 a critical accounting policy is one that is both material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires us to make difficult subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate and different estimates that we could have used or changes in the estimates that are reasonably likely to occur may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process actual results could differ from those estimates 

accounting policies guidelines and interpretations related to our critical accounting policies and estimates are generally subject to numerous sources of authoritative guidance and are often reexamined by accounting standards rule makers and regulators these rule makers andor regulators may promulgate interpretations guidance or regulations that may result in changes to our accounting policies which could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 

revenue recognition 

we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with determining the amounts of software license and services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period 

our primary judgments involve the following 

 

   

  

  

 we derive revenues from three primary sources 1 software licenses 2 maintenance services and 3 consulting and training services revenue by type for 2009 2008 and 2007 was as follows 

 

 for software license arrangements that do not require significant modification or customization of the underlying software we recognize revenue when 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 2 delivery has occurred generally fob shipping point or electronic distribution 3 the fee is fixed or determinable and 4 collection is probable substantially all of our license revenues are recognized in this manner 

our software is distributed primarily through our direct sales force in addition we have an indirect distribution channel through alliances with resellers and for our mathcad products with distributors approximately 25 of our total revenue in 2009 was generated from our indirect distribution channel revenue arrangements with resellers are recognized on a sellthrough basis that is when we deliver the product to the enduser customer we do not offer contractual rights of return stock balancing or price protection to our resellers and actual product returns from them have been insignificant to date as a result we do not maintain reserves for reseller product returns and related allowances in contrast revenue arrangements with distributors of our mathcad products have a contractual right to exchange product and are recognized on a sellin basis that is when we ship the products to the distributor as of september 30 2009 2008 and 2007 the value of mathcad product inventory held by distributors and the accrual that we have recorded for estimated product returns were not material 

at the time of each sale transaction we must make an assessment of the collectibility of the amount due from the customer revenue is only recognized at that time if management deems that collection is probable in making this assessment we consider customer creditworthiness and historical payment experience at that same time we assess whether fees are fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties if the fee is not fixed or determinable revenue is recognized only as payments become due from the customer provided that all other revenue recognition criteria are met in assessing whether the fee is fixed or determinable we consider the payment terms of the transaction including transactions with payment terms that extend beyond our customary payment terms and our collection experience in similar transactions without making concessions among other factors our software license arrangements generally do not include customer acceptance provisions however if an arrangement includes an acceptance provision we record revenue only upon the earlier of 1 receipt of written acceptance from the customer or 2 expiration of the acceptance period 

our software arrangements often include implementation and consulting services that are sold under consulting engagement contracts or as part of the software license arrangement when we determine that such services are not essential to the functionality of the licensed software we record revenue separately for the 

  

license and service elements of these arrangements provided that appropriate evidence of fair value exists for the undelivered services see discussion below generally we consider that a service is not essential to the functionality of the software based on various factors including if the services may be provided by independent third parties experienced in providing such consulting and implementation in coordination with dedicated customer personnel and whether the services result in any modification or customization of the software functionality if an arrangement does not qualify for separate accounting of the license and service elements then license revenue is recognized together with the consulting services using either the percentageofcompletion or completedcontract method of contract accounting contract accounting for both license and service elements is also applied to any software arrangements that include customerspecific acceptance criteria or where the license payment is tied to the performance of consulting services under the percentageofcompletion method we estimate the stage of completion of contracts with fixed or “not to exceed” fees based on hours or costs incurred to date as compared with estimated total project hours or costs at completion if we do not have a sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion revenue is recognized upon completion of the contract when total cost estimates exceed revenues we accrue for the estimated losses when identified the use of the percentageofcompletion method of accounting requires significant judgment relative to estimating total contract hours or costs including assumptions relative to the length of time to complete the project the nature and complexity of the work to be performed and anticipated changes in salaries and other costs when adjustments in estimated contract hours or costs are determined such revisions may have the effect of adjusting in the current period the earnings applicable to performance in prior periods 

we generally use the residual method to recognize revenue from software arrangements that include one or more elements to be delivered at a future date when evidence of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists under the residual method the fair value of the undelivered elements ie maintenance consulting and training services based on vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe is deferred and the remaining portion of the total arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements ie software license if evidence of the fair value of one or more of the undelivered services does not exist all revenues are deferred and recognized when delivery of all of those services has occurred or when fair values can be established we determine vsoe of the fair value of services revenue based upon our recent pricing for those services when sold separately for certain transactions vsoe of the fair value of maintenance services is determined based on a substantive maintenance renewal clause within a customer contract our current pricing practices are influenced primarily by product type purchase volume and customer location we review services sold separately on a periodic basis and update when appropriate our vsoe of fair value for such services to ensure that it reflects our recent pricing experience any increase in our vsoe assumptions of the fair value of maintenance services or consulting and training services would decrease the amount allocated to license revenue 

accounting for income taxes 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to calculate our income tax expense based on taxable income by jurisdiction there are many transactions and calculations about which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain as a result our calculations involve estimates by management some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenuesharing costreimbursement and transfer pricing arrangements among related entities and the differing tax treatment of revenue and cost items across various jurisdictions if we were compelled to revise or to account differently for our arrangements that revision could affect our tax liability 

the income tax accounting process also involves estimating our actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheets we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized we must establish a valuation allowance as a charge to income tax expense 

  

as of september 30 2009 we have a remaining valuation allowance of 463 million against net deferred tax assets the valuation allowance includes 232 million recorded against net deferred tax assets in the us consisting primarily of foreign tax credits the valuation allowance also includes 231 million recorded against net deferred tax assets in certain foreign jurisdictions consisting primarily of net operating loss carryforwards that will likely expire without being utilized 

at september 30 2009 we have a net deferred tax asset balance of 1235 million primarily relating to our us operations we have concluded based on the weight of available evidence that our net deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized in the future in arriving at this conclusion we evaluated all available evidence including our pretax results for the last three years adjusted for permanent differences the circumstances of a pretax loss generated in the us in the most recent fiscal year and our forecast of future taxable income we reassess our valuation allowance requirements each financial reporting period if our results in 2010 do not improve in our us operations our assessment may indicate that a valuation allowance is required 

in the normal course of business ptc and its subsidiaries are examined by various taxing authorities including the internal revenue service irs in the united states we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate we are currently under audit by tax authorities in several foreign jurisdictions audits by tax authorities typically involve examination of the deductibility of certain permanent items limitations on net operating losses and tax credits although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in material changes in our estimates 

valuation of assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations 

in accordance with business combination accounting we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and inprocess research and development based on their estimated fair values determining these fair values requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets 

our identifiable intangible assets acquired consist of developed technology core technology tradenames customer lists and contracts software support agreements and related relationships and consulting contracts developed technology consists of products that have reached technological feasibility core technology represents a combination of processes inventions and trade secrets related to the design and development of acquired products customer lists and contracts and software support agreements and related relationships represent the underlying relationships and agreements with customers of the acquired company’s installed base we have generally valued intangible assets using a discounted cash flow model critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to 

 

  

  

  

 in addition we estimate the useful lives of our intangible assets based upon the expected period over which we anticipate generating economic benefits from the related intangible asset 

  

net tangible assets consist of the fair values of tangible assets less the fair values of assumed liabilities and obligations except for deferred revenues and restructuring reserves net tangible assets were generally valued by us at the respective carrying amounts recorded by the acquired company as we believed that their carrying values approximated their fair values at the acquisition date 

the values assigned to deferred revenue reflect an amount equivalent to the estimated cost plus an appropriate profit margin to perform the services related to the acquired company’s software support contracts restructuring reserves include the severance costs related to terminating the employment of employees of the acquired company planned closure of certain facilities and other costs associated with exiting activities of the acquired company 

our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable at that time but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions estimates or actual results 

valuation of goodwill 

our goodwill totaled 4283 million and 4052 million as of september 30 2009 and 2008 respectively 

we assess the impairment of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets on at least an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable factors we consider important on an overall company basis and reportable segment basis as applicable that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results significant changes in our use of the acquired assets or a significant change in the strategy for our business significant negative industry or economic trends a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period or a reduction of our market capitalization relative to net book value 

the goodwill impairment test prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires us to identify reporting units and to determine estimates of the fair values of our reporting units as of the date we test for impairment to conduct these tests of goodwill the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value if the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeded its fair value we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value of goodwill and its implied fair value we estimate the fair values of our reporting units using discounted cash flow valuation models those models require estimates of future revenues profits capital expenditures working capital and discount rates for each reporting unit we estimate these amounts by evaluating historical trends current budgets operating plans and industry data we conduct our annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite lived assets as of the end of the third quarter of each fiscal year we completed our annual impairment review as of july 4 2009 and concluded that no impairment charge was required as of that date revenue and operating margin projections are significant assumptions in our analysis adjusting those assumptions by 10 would not have had an impact on the results of our impairment analysis 

for longlived assets and identifiable intangible assets other than goodwill we reassess the recoverability of the asset based on projected undiscounted future cash flows over the asset’s remaining life if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reportable segment below its carrying value when the carrying value of the asset exceeds its undiscounted cash flows we record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset determined using projected discounted future cash flows of the asset determining the fair value of our reporting units for the purpose of testing the potential impairment of individual assets and goodwill requires significant judgment by management different judgments could yield different results 

  

accounting for pensions 

in the us we sponsor a frozen pension plan covering mostly inactive participants we make several assumptions that are used in calculating the expense and liability of this plan these key assumptions include the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate in selecting the expected longterm rate of return on assets we consider the average future rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits under the pension plan this includes considering the plan’s asset allocations and the expected returns likely to be earned over the life of this plan the discount rate reflects the estimated rate at which an amount that is invested in a portfolio of highquality debt instruments would provide the future cash flows necessary to pay benefits when they come due in addition our actuarial consultants determine the expense and liabilities of the plan using other assumptions for future experience such as mortality rates the actuarial assumptions used by us may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions or longer or shorter life spans of the participants our actual results could differ materially from those we estimated which could require us to record a greater amount of pension expense in future years in determining our pension cost for 2009 2008 and 2007 we used a discount rate of 750 625 and 575 respectively and an expected return on plan assets of 750 for each year 

certain of our foreign subsidiaries also sponsor pension plans accounting and reporting for these plans requires the use of countryspecific assumptions for discount rates and expected rates of return on assets we apply a consistent methodology in determining the key assumptions that in addition to future experience assumptions such as mortality rates are used by our actuaries to determine our liability and expense for each of these plans in determining our pension cost for 2009 2008 and 2007 we used weighted average discount rates of 57 52 and 47 respectively and weighted average expected returns on plan assets of 62 57 and 38 respectively 

in 2009 and 2008 our actual return on plan assets was a gain of 18 million and a loss of 132 million respectively distress in the financial markets has caused among other things extreme volatility in security prices severely diminished liquidity and credit availability rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuation of others if actual returns continue to be below our expected rate of return it will impact the amount and timing of future contributions and expense for these plans 

the most sensitive assumptions used in calculating the expense and liability of our pension plans are the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets a 50 basis point change to our discount rate and expected return on plan assets assumptions would have changed our pension expense for the year ended september 30 2009 by approximately 1 million a 50 basis point decrease in our discount rate assumptions would increase our projected benefit obligation as of september 30 2009 by approximately 12 million 

  

allowance for accounts and other receivables 

management judgment is required in assessing the collectibility of customer accounts and other receivables for which we generally do not require collateral we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments in determining the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts management specifically analyzes individual accounts receivable historical bad debts customer concentrations customer creditworthiness current economic conditions accounts receivable aging trends and changes in our customer payment terms our customer base consists of large numbers of geographically diverse customers dispersed across many industries and no individual customer comprised more than 10 of our net accounts receivable for any period presented the following table summarizes our accounts receivable and related reserve balances at september 30 2009 and 2008 

 

 if the financial condition of our customers deteriorated additional allowances might be required resulting in future operating expenses that are not included in the allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for bad debts as a percentage of gross accounts receivable varies depending on the level and timing of quarterly revenue as well as the timing of the resolution of specifically reserved doubtful accounts receivable either via collection or writeoff 

restructuring charges 

we periodically record restructuring charges resulting from restructuring our operations including consolidations andor relocations of operations changes to our strategic plan or managerial responses to declines in demand increasing costs or other market factors the determination of restructuring charges requires management judgment and may include costs related to employee benefits such as costs of severance and termination benefits and estimates of costs for future lease commitments on excess facilities net of estimated future sublease income in determining the amount of the facilities charge we are required to estimate such factors as future vacancy rates the time required to sublet properties and sublease rates these estimates are reviewed quarterly based on known real estate market conditions and the creditworthiness of subtenants and may result in revisions to established facility reserves we had 40 million accrued as of september 30 2009 related to excess facilities compared to 117 million at september 30 2008 representing gross lease commitments with agreements expiring at various dates through 2013 of approximately 102 million net of committed sublease income of approximately 61 million and a present value factor of 01 million 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

 

 we invest our cash with highly rated financial institutions and in diversified domestic and international money market mutual funds the portfolio is invested in shortterm instruments to ensure cash is available to meet requirements as needed 

cash and cash equivalents 

2009 compared to 2008 

the decrease in cash and cash equivalents in 2009 compared to 2008 was due primarily to 

 

  

  

  

 these uses of cash were partially offset by 697 million of cash provided by operations 

2008 compared to 2007 

the decrease in cash and cash equivalents in 2008 compared to 2007 was due primarily to 

 

  

  

 these uses of cash were partially offset by 

 

  

   

cash provided by operating activities 

2009 compared to 2008 

the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to 

 

  

  

 these uses of cash were partially offset by lower receivables as of september 30 2009 compared to september 30 2008 days sales outstanding was 62 days as of the end of 2009 compared to 61 days as of the end of 2008 

2008 compared to 2007 

the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to 

 

  

 days sales outstanding at the end of 2007 was adversely affected by the timing of revenue recorded and the impact of extended payment term deals we offered to customers during 2007 and 2006 

we provided extended payment terms greater than twelve months on internally financed transactions including revenue and imputed interest accounting for approximately 26 million in each of 2009 and 2008 and 29 million in 2007 other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets include noncurrent receivables from customers related to extended payment term contracts totaling 105 million and 163 million at september 30 2009 and 2008 respectively 

cash used by investing activities 

 

 we have completed acquisitions of businesses in each of 2009 2008 and 2007 in 2008 we paid net of cash acquired 2475 million for cocreate our expenditures for property and equipment consist primarily of computer equipment software office equipment and facility improvements 

  

cash provided used by financing activities 

 

 share repurchase authorization 

our board of directors has authorized us to use up to 100 million of cash from operations to repurchase shares of our common stock in open market purchases this authorization will expire on may 31 2010 unless earlier revoked in 2009 we repurchased 12 million shares at a cost of 142 million leaving 806 million remaining under our current authorization in 2008 we repurchased 17 million shares at a cost of 273 million including 14 million shares at a cost of 220 million under a prior authorization in 2007 we repurchased 06 million shares at a cost of 100 million all shares of our common stock repurchased are automatically restored to the status of authorized and unissued future repurchases of shares will reduce our cash balances 

credit facility 

we have a revolving credit facility with a bank syndicate under which we may borrow funds up to 230 million repay the same in whole or in part and reborrow at any time through february 20 2011 when all amounts outstanding will be due and payable in full although we have the contractual right to borrow these funds under the credit facility conditions in the credit markets may preclude our ability to draw those funds if we were to seek to do so 

on november 28 2007 in connection with our acquisition of cocreate we borrowed 220 million under the credit facility in two tranches 36 million that accrued interest at the eurodollarbased borrowing rate and an alternate currency loan of 1246 million euros equivalent to 184 million at the borrowing date the 36 million loan was repaid in full in 2008 in addition to date we have repaid 850 million euros of the alternate currency loan including 233 million euros in 2009 as of september 30 2009 we had 396 million euros outstanding under the revolving credit facility which was equivalent to 579 million on that date the current loan accrues interest at 18 per year and matures on february 26 2010 upon the due date and subsequent due dates we may either repay the amount outstanding or roll over the amount outstanding with new short term loans at the then current interest rates under the credit facility 

for a description of the terms and conditions of the credit facility including limitations on our ability to undertake certain actions see “note h commitments and contingencies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10k 

expectations for fiscal 2010 

we believe that existing cash and cash equivalents together with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements through at least the next twelve months 

  

during 2010 we expect to use cash to repurchase our shares and to repay the remaining amount outstanding under our revolving credit facility capital expenditures are currently anticipated to be approximately 25 million in addition we expect to make cash disbursements estimated at 15 million for restructuring charges incurred in 2009 and prior periods 

we have evaluated and expect to continue to evaluate possible strategic transactions on an ongoing basis and at any given time may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to possible strategic transactions 

our expected uses of cash could change our cash position could be reduced and we may incur additional debt obligations to the extent we complete any significant acquisitions andor pay any amounts settlements or judgments related to significant legal matters 

contractual obligations 

we lease office facilities and certain equipment under operating leases that expire at various dates through 2020 including an operating lease agreement related to our headquarters office in needham massachusetts entered into in 2000 which expires in november 2012 subject to certain renewal rights these leases qualify for operating lease accounting treatment and as such are not included on our balance sheet at september 30 2009 our contractual obligations including future minimum lease payments net of sublease income under noncancellable operating leases are as follows 

 

  

      

as of september 30 2009 we had letters of credit and bank guarantees outstanding of approximately 48 million of which 14 million was collateralized primarily related to the lease of our headquarters in needham massachusetts 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have not created and are not party to any specialpurpose or offbalance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital incurring debt or operating parts of our business that are not consolidated to the extent of our ownership interest therein into our financial statements we have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby we have subordinated retained interests derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks contingent liabilities or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing liquidity market risk or credit risk support to us

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend we face exposure to financial market risks including adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 

foreign currency exchange risk 

our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to western european countries and japan we enter into various hedging transactions to manage this risk we do not enter into or hold foreign currency derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

our nonus revenues generally are transacted through our nonus subsidiaries and typically are denominated in their local currency in addition our nonus expenses that are incurred by our nonus subsidiaries typically are denominated in their local currency approximately 63 66 and 61 of our total revenue was from sales to customers outside of north america in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively approximately 50 52 and 46 of our total expenses were incurred by our subsidiaries domiciled outside of north america in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations arises in part from intercompany transactions with most intercompany transactions occurring between a us dollar functional currency entity and a foreign currency denominated entity intercompany transactions typically are denominated in the local currency of the nonus subsidiary in order to centralize foreign currency risk also both ptc the parent company and our nonus subsidiaries may transact business with our customers and vendors in a currency other than their functional currency transaction risk in addition we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results and balances of our nonus subsidiaries are translated into us dollars translation risk if sales to customers outside of the united states increase our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could increase 

our foreign currency risk management strategy is principally designed to mitigate the future potential financial impact of changes in the us dollar value of balances denominated in foreign currency resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates our foreign currency hedging program uses forward contracts to 

  

manage the foreign currency exposures that exist as part of our ongoing business operations the contracts primarily are denominated in european currencies and japanese yen and have maturities of less than three months 

generally we do not designate foreign currency forward contracts as hedges for accounting purposes and changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized immediately in earnings because we enter into forward contracts only as an economic hedge any gain or loss on the underlying foreigndenominated balance would be offset by the loss or gain on the forward contract gains and losses on forward contracts and foreign denominated receivables and payables are included in other expense net 

as of september 30 2009 and 2008 we had outstanding forward contracts with notional amounts equivalent to the following 

 

 debt 

as of september 30 2009 the amount outstanding under our variablerate revolving credit facility was 396 million euros which was equivalent to 579 million on that date the current loan matures on february 26 2010 and accrues interest at 18 per annum upon the due date and subsequent due dates we may either repay the amount outstanding or roll over the amount outstanding with new short term loans at the then current interest rates under the credit facility this eurodenominated loan is subject to foreign currency rate risk additionally the entire amount is subject to interest rate risk as interest rates will be adjusted at the respective due date to the extent such amounts are not repaid the impact would be partially mitigated by the floating rate interest earned on excess cash if there was a hypothetical 10 change in interest rates the annual net impact to earnings and cash flows would be approximately 01 million this hypothetical change in cash flows and earnings has been calculated based on the borrowings outstanding at september 30 2009 and the current interest rate of 18 per annum applied over a oneyear period 

cash and cash equivalents 

as of september 30 2009 cash equivalents were invested in highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased we invest our cash with highly rated financial institutions in north america europe and asiapacific and in diversified domestic and international money market mutual funds at september 30 2009 we had cash and cash equivalents of 772 million in the united states 1008 million in europe 254 million in japan and 317 million in other nonus countries principally in asiapacific given the short maturities and investment grade quality of the portfolio holdings at september 30 2009 a hypothetical 10 change in interest rates would not materially affect the fair value of our cash and cash equivalents 

our invested cash is subject to interest rate fluctuations and for nonus operations foreign currency risk in a declining interest rate environment we would experience a decrease in interest income the opposite holds true in a rising interest rate environment over the past several years the us federal reserve board european central bank and bank of england have changed certain benchmark interest rates which have led to declines 

  

and increases in market interest rates these changes in market interest rates have resulted in fluctuations in interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents interest income will continue to fluctuate based on changes in market interest rates and levels of cash available for investment our consolidated cash balances were impacted favorably by 38 million and 86 million in 2009 and 2007 respectively and unfavorably in 2008 by 40 million by the strengthening and weakening respectively of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar particularly the euro and the japanese yen

an extension of our plm solutions our product information delivery solutions enable our customers to address significant inefficiencies in crossfunctional or complex documentation development processes today most companies use traditional publishing tools that involve a significant amount of manual work to maintain accurate documentation this causes considerable additional work where multiple authors contribute to the development of content content changes frequently multiple organizations within a company have specialized requirements but use similar content or regulatory compliance requires standardization across all information outputs our product information delivery solutions allow customers to create compound documents from reusable content components leverage cad in the creation of technical illustrations manage the content and processes to enable teams to work together and configure and publish the information for a variety of uses and audiences in multiple formats

backlog 

we generally ship our products within 30 days after acceptance of a customer order a high percentage of our license revenue historically has been generated in the third month of each fiscal quarter and this revenue tends to be concentrated in the later part of that month accordingly orders may exist at the end of a quarter that have not been shipped and not been recognized as revenue we do not believe that our backlog at any particular point in time is indicative of future sales levels

i operational considerations 

our operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter which makes it difficult to predict our revenue and operating results and could adversely affect our stock price 

our quarterly operating results have historically fluctuated and are likely to continue to fluctuate depending on a number of factors including the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 accordingly our quarterly results are difficult to predict prior to the end of the quarter and we may be unable to confirm or adjust expectations with respect to our operating results for a particular quarter until that quarter has closed any failure to meet our quarterly revenue or earnings targets could adversely impact the market price of our stock 

weakness in the united states and international economies may harm our business 

as our business has expanded globally and the proportion of our revenues we generate in europe and the asiapacific region has increased we have become increasingly subject to the risks arising from adverse changes in global economic conditions especially those in europe and the asiapacific region economic growth in the united states slowed in 2008 and macroeconomic conditions have deteriorated worldwide in the second half of calendar 2008 if economic growth continues to slow customers may delay reduce or forego technology purchases this could result in reductions in sales of our products longer sales cycles slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition further deteriorating economic conditions could adversely affect our customers and their ability to pay amounts owed to us any of these events would likely harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

our forecasts of our revenues and earnings outlook may be inaccurate 

our revenues particularly new software license revenues are difficult to forecast we use a pipeline system to forecast revenues and trends in our business we monitor the status of potential business and estimate when a customer will make a purchase decision the dollar amount of the sale and the products or services to be sold these estimates are aggregated periodically to generate the pipeline our pipeline estimates may prove to be unreliable either in a particular quarter or over a longer period of time in part because the conversion rate of the pipeline into contracts can be difficult to estimate and requires management judgment a variation in the conversion rate could cause us to plan or budget incorrectly and materially adversely impact our business or our planned results of operations in particular a slowdown in customer spending or weak economic conditions generally can reduce the conversion rate in a particular quarter as purchasing decisions are delayed reduced in amount or cancelled 

  

we depend on sales within the manufacturing market which could decrease if manufacturing activity slows 

a large amount of our revenues are related to sales to customers in the manufacturing sector a decline in general economic or business conditions or a decline in spending in this sector could cause customers to reduce or defer spending on information technology which would cause our revenue and earnings to decrease or to grow more slowly the institute for supply management’s manufacturing index a key measure of us manufacturing activity fell to a seven year low in september 2008 and fell further to a 26year low in october 2008 indicating a contraction in manufacturing activity accordingly this could be our first indication that customers may begin to reduce or defer spending on our products and services which would decrease our revenues 

our cost structure is relatively fixed in the short term which makes it difficult to reduce our expenses quickly in response to declines in revenue or revenue growth 

we make expenditures to support our revenue growth in advance of achieving the expected revenue our expenses associated with headcount and facilities can be difficult to reduce quickly due to the nature of those items if revenue does not grow at the rate we expect or if it declines our expenses may constitute a larger percentage of our operating budget than we planned which would adversely affect our profitability 

we may be adversely affected by a decline in demand for product lifecycle management plm solutions 

we currently derive our license and service revenues predominantly from our integrated plm software products and services and we expect this to continue into the future as a result factors affecting the demand for plm software solutions including weakness in the general economy or pricing pressures on this single category could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

we are relocating some of our business functions to new locations which could adversely affect our operations 

as part of our efforts to increase our presence in strategic regions and to reduce our operating costs we are relocating some of our business functions to new locations including china and russia transitioning those functions to those locations involves terminating employees in the location from which the business function is moved which will cause us to incur restructuring costs and may cause disruption in those business functions as new personnel are hired and trained additionally because we do not have significant operating experience in some of these countries it may take us longer to realize the benefits we expect from relocating those functions if at all 

we use third parties in addition to our direct sales force for the distribution and implementation of our software solutions which makes it more difficult to manage customer relationships 

we have entered into relationships with groups of geographically dispersed resellers and other strategic partners to promote sell andor implement our products which can reduce our control over the sales process and the delivery of services to our customers our ability to successfully distribute and implement our software solutions through third parties will depend on 

 

  

  

  

   

we have significant sales and operations outside the united states which exposes us to additional operating and compliance risks 

nonus revenues accounted for approximately 66 of our total revenue in 2008 61 of our total revenue in 2007 and 57 of our total revenue in 2006 we expect revenue from our nonus operations will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenue as part of our international operations we sell and deliver software and services and maintain support operations in a large number of nonus countries whose laws and practices differ from those in the us accordingly while we maintain a comprehensive compliance program including in the areas of business conduct financial integrity export control and antibribery we cannot guarantee that an employee agent or partner will not act in violation of ptc policy or us or other applicable laws such violations can lead to civil andor criminal prosecutions substantial fines and the revocation of our rights to continue certain operations and also cause both business and reputation loss our international operations also subject us to additional operational risks many of which are beyond our control including 

 

  

  

  

 any of these events could reduce our revenue or net sales increase our expenses or decrease our operating margins 

because a substantial portion of our sales are to existing customers and sales to new customers often rely on customer references our business could be adversely affected if our customers were to become dissatisfied with our products andor services 

many of our sales are followon sales to existing customers who invest in our product development system if a significant number of customers were to become dissatisfied with our products or services or otherwise elected to adopt either competing solutions or a competitive product development system we could lose those followon sales which would adversely affect our revenues in addition we could lose an important source of references which could adversely impact our ability to obtain new customers finally a decrease in the size of our installed base could adversely affect both our license revenues and our service revenues 

our financial condition could be adversely affected if significant errors or defects are found in our software 

sophisticated software often contains errors defects or other performance problems when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released as these enhanced versions contain additional programming code and third party sourced functionality that must work across our large product suite if errors or defects are discovered in our current or future products we may not be able to correct them in a timely manner or provide an adequate response to our customers we may therefore need to expend significant financial technical and management resources or divert some of our development resources in order to resolve or work around those defects 

errors defects or other performance problems in our products could cause us to delay product releases or customer deployments any such delays could cause us to incorrectly predict the fiscal quarter in which we will realize revenue from the licensing and shipment of new or enhanced products and give our competitors a greater opportunity to market competing products such difficulties could also cause us to lose customers technical problems or the loss of customers could also damage our business reputation and cause us to lose new business opportunities 

  

we may be unable to successfully acquire and integrate additional strategic businesses and any additional businesses we acquire may not achieve the revenue and earnings we anticipated 

the success of our longterm strategic plan depends in part on our ability to acquire strategic businesses andor technologies if we are unable to identify and complete such acquisitions we may not achieve our revenue or earnings targets if the businesses andor technologies we acquire do not generate the revenue and earnings we expect or if we are unable to effectively integrate the acquired technology into our products we may not achieve our revenue or earnings targets 

in addition business combinations involve a number of factors that affect operations and operating results including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 as a result we may fail to successfully integrate and manage businesses and technologies that we may acquire without incurring substantial expenses delays or other problems that could negatively impact our results of operations if our shortterm liquidity declines or we are forced to divert attention from other initiatives due to resource constraints in connection with acquisitionrelated activity our ability to implement other strategic initiatives or make investments in our operational infrastructure could be impaired 

we are dependent on key personnel whose loss could impair our operations our product development or our sales efforts 

our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial technical and sales personnel 

we require highly skilled technical personnel to develop our products competition for such personnel in our industry is intense if we are unable to attract and retain technical personnel with the requisite skills our product development efforts could be delayed which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

our sales efforts rely on having a sufficient number of sales representatives with the skills and knowledge necessary to sell our products including an ability to educate our customers about our products in order to create and meet demand for our products if we are unable to attract or retain sales personnel with the requisite expertise our revenue could be adversely affected 

we must continually modify and enhance our products to keep pace with changing technology and address our customers’ needs and expectations and any failure to do so could reduce demand for our products 

our ability to remain competitive will depend on our ability to enhance our current offerings and develop new products and services that keep pace with technological developments and meet evolving customer requirements through 

 

  

   

 in addition our solutions must meet customer expectations to be successful especially with respect to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 if our solutions fail to meet customer expectations customers may stop their adoption of our solutions resulting in a loss of potential additional sales and we may be unable to retain existing customers or attract new customers for our solutions 

at times we provide extended payment terms to our customers which may be a factor in our customers’ purchasing decisions and our revenues could be adversely affected if we ceased making these terms available 

we have provided extended payment terms to certain customers in connection with transactions we have completed with them providing extended payment terms may positively influence our customers’ purchasing decisions but may reduce our cash flows in the shortterm if we reduce the amount of extended payment terms we provide to customers customers might reduce or defer the amount they spend on our products and services from the amount they might otherwise have spent if extended payment terms were available to them if this were to occur our revenue or revenue growth could be lower than in prior periods or than we expect 

we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights 

our software products and trademarks including our company names product names and logos are proprietary we protect our intellectual property rights in these items by relying on copyrights trademarks patents and common law safeguards including trade secret protection as well as restrictions on disclosures and transferability contained in our agreements with other parties despite these measures the laws of all relevant jurisdictions may not afford adequate protection to our products and other intellectual property in addition we frequently encounter attempts by individuals and companies to pirate our software solutions if our measures to protect our intellectual property rights fail others may be able to use those rights which could reduce our competitiveness and revenues 

intellectual property infringement claims could be asserted against us which could be expensive to defend and could result in limitations on our use of the claimed intellectual property 

the software industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding copyright patent and other intellectual property rights while we have not had any significant claims of this type asserted against us such claims could be asserted against us in the future if a lawsuit of this type is filed it could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel we cannot be sure that we would prevail against any such asserted claims if we did not prevail we could be prevented from using that intellectual property or required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements which might not be available on terms acceptable to us in addition to possible claims with respect to our proprietary information some of our products contain technology developed by and licensed from third parties and we may likewise be susceptible to infringement claims with respect to these thirdparty technologies 

  

competition is increasing which may reduce our profits and limit or reduce our market share 

the market for our plm software solutions is rapidly changing and increasingly competitive we expect competition to intensify which could result in price reductions for our products and services reduced margins and loss of market share our primary competition comes from 

 

  

 in addition recent and ongoing consolidation within the software industry has given rise to new and stronger competitors 

growth in the computeraided design solutions industry has slowed 

growth in certain segments of the computeraided design solutions industry has slowed and coupled with decreased functional differentiation among flexible engineering tools may adversely affect our ability to penetrate the market for new customers and capture market share 

increasing competition in the computeraided design marketplace may reduce our revenues 

a large portion of our revenues are currently derived from our computeraided design solutions and there are an increasing number of competitive design products some of which emphasize lower price points and ease of use compared to the more robust functionality of our solutions this increased competition makes attracting new customers more difficult in addition some competitive products have reached a level of functionality whereby product differentiation is less likely in and of itself to dislodge incumbent design systems given the training data conversion and other startup costs associated with system replacement although proengineer wildfire which focuses on plm interoperability and ease of use is designed to address these competitive pressures increased competition and further market acceptance of competitive products could have a negative effect on pricing and revenue for our products which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and our operating margins 

ii other considerations 

we are currently defending a lawsuit seeking substantial damages in which we could be liable 

on august 2 2007 ge capital leasing corporation gecl filed a lawsuit against us in the us district court for the district of massachusetts the lawsuit alleges that gecl was fraudulently induced to provide over 60 million in financing to toshiba corporation for purchases of third party products predominantly ptc products during the period from 2003 to 2006 gecl claims that ptc participated in the alleged scheme or alternatively should have been aware of the scheme and made negligent misrepresentations that enabled the scheme to continue undetected all of the alleged transactions occurred in japan gecl’s complaint claims damages of 47 million and seeks three times that amount plus attorneys’ fees on october 2 2008 the united states district court for the district of massachusetts entered an order granting ptc’s motion to dismiss gecl’s complaint subject to certain conditions including ptc’s agreement to provide certain discovery to gecl and to assent to personal jurisdiction in japan on november 17 2008 gecl filed a motion to vacate the court’s october 2 nd order and to seek to continue the case in the us we are opposing gecl’s motion if the case is not reopened in the us we believe it likely that gecl will file a new action in japan against ptc andor its japanese subsidiary we dispute gecl’s claims and intend to contest them vigorously as of september 30 2008 and 2007 revenue of 438 million and 403 million respectively that was previously recorded for the transactions at issue has been deferred and recorded as customer advances in our consolidated balance sheets that liability will remain recorded until the rights and obligations of the several companies connected with the 

  

toshiba transactions are resolved the change in customer advances at september 30 2008 from september 30 2007 is due to foreign currency translation adjustments related to these balances which are recorded in japanese yen to the extent that matters are resolved in our favor we will reduce customer advances and record revenue or other income at that time we have not accrued any other liability for this matter as of september 30 2008 

we have a revolving credit facility and have borrowed funds under that facility 

in connection with our acquisition of cocreate software gmbh in november 2007 we borrowed approximately 220 million under our revolving credit facility and have since reduced the balance owed to 885 million as of september 30 2008 we may undertake additional borrowings against the credit facility in the future to support our operations including additional strategic acquisitions for any such borrowing we will incur periodic payment obligations in addition we are required to comply with the required financial and operating covenants which could limit our ability to operate our business as we otherwise might operate it our failure to comply with any of these covenants or to meet our payment obligations could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived would result in all amounts outstanding including all accrued interest and unpaid fees becoming immediately due and payable we may not have sufficient working capital or liquidity to satisfy our repayment obligations in the event of an acceleration of those obligations in addition if we are not in compliance with the financial and operating covenants at the time we wish to borrow funds we will be unable to borrow funds or to borrow additional funds 

our stock price has been volatile which may make it harder to resell your shares at a time and at a price that is favorable to you 

market prices for securities of software companies are generally volatile and are subject to significant fluctuations unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies the trading prices and valuations of these stocks and of ours may not be predictable negative changes in the public’s perception of the prospects of software companies or of ptc or the plm market generally could depress our stock price regardless of our results moreover current conditions in the stock market have caused trading prices including that of our common stock to fall for reasons unrelated to historical company performance and there is no indication of when conditions in the stock market will improve 

also a large percentage of our common stock is held by institutional investors purchases and sales of our common stock by these institutional investors could have a significant impact on the market price of the stock for more information about those investors please see our proxy statement with respect to our most recent annual meeting of stockholders and schedules 13d and 13g filed with the sec with respect to our common stock

unless otherwise indicated all references to a year reflect our fiscal year that ends on september 30 

executive overview 

in 2008 we reported revenue of 1070 million and operating income of 125 million a 180 basis point improvement in operating margins from 2007 our acquisition of cocreate software gmbh acquired on november 30 2007 and favorable foreign currency exchange rate movements were significant contributors to our operating results for the year largely due to these factors we experienced revenue growth in europe and asiapacific we also generated over 222 million of operating cash flow an increase of over 90 million from 2007 as a result of improved profitability and strong customer collections with days sales outstanding improving to 61 days at the end of 2008 versus 74 days at the end of 2007 

we see the most significant risks for 2009 to be the macroeconomic climate which could cause our customers to delay forego or reduce the amount of their investments in our solutions or delay payments of amounts due to us and the recent decline in foreign currency exchange rates particularly the euro which could adversely affect our reported results as amounts earned in other countries are translated into dollars for reporting purposes 

we have been and expect to continue investing in our product portfolio through both internal development and strategic acquisitions we have also undertaken a number of initiatives to enhance our longterm business model including significant steps toward globalizing our work force evolving our distribution model enhancing the efficiency and scale of our services business and growing our base of maintenancepaying customers 

product releases 

the most recent releases of our two core products—windchill 90 which was released in the fourth quarter of 2007 and proengineer wildfire 40 which was released in january 2008—included significant functionality enhancements that we believe will create additional revenue opportunities we also continue to migrate our customers on nonwindchillbased versions of prointralink to the new windchillbased prointralink the number of customers that have completed this migration has increased with the release of windchillbased prointralink 90 and we expect this to continue we believe this will result in increased services revenue and generate future license and maintenance revenue as we expect our installed base will then expand their windchill use we also expect to release windchill productpoint in december 2008 windchill productpoint is targeted at the small and mediumsize business smb market which we believe represents a growth opportunity over the longer term 

globalization 

as part of our continuing efforts to increase profitability we have relocated business functions to locations including china where we are seeking to enhance our business presence and where labor costs are lower as part of this globalization initiative as well as the integration of cocreate we incurred restructuring costs of 201 million in 2008 we believe that by moving certain business functions to these locations we have increased both our strategic presence and our ability to add cost effective resources as our business grows we do not expect to incur restructuring costs related to these initiatives in 2009 

  

acquisitions 

a significant element of our growth strategy is to acquire strategic companies and technologies that expand our solution footprint andor our distribution model we have made a number of strategic acquisitions that add to and expand elements of our solutions each of our acquisitions has helped us to extend our product development system which we consider to be a significant competitive advantage for us you can find more information about these acquisitions under the subheading “acquisitions” of item 1 “business” of this annual report which begins on page 1 and in note e to the accompanying “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

fiscal year 2009 strategies and risks 

in 2009 our revenue and operating results will be impacted by currency fluctuations the us dollar strengthened relative to the euro and the yen in the first two months of 2009 and the impact of a slowing worldwide economy balancing a difficult nearterm economic situation with the longerterm opportunity for the business we are modestly increasing our investments in the business 

our primary strategic initiatives for 2009 are to 

 

  

  

  

 our success will depend on among other factors our ability to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we discuss additional factors affecting our revenue and operating results under item 1a “risk factors ” of this annual report 

  

results of operations 

explanatory note about our revenue reporting 

as of the first quarter of 2008 we have been reporting revenue by line of business license maintenance and consulting and training service and by geographic region we previously also reported our revenue in two product categories enterprise solutions and desktop solutions we no longer use these product categories to report revenue the discussion below gives effect to this change for the periods presented 

impact of foreign currency exchange on results of operations 

approximately two thirds of our revenue and half of our expenses are transacted in currencies outside of the us because we report our results of operations in us dollars currency translation affects our reported results on a yearoveryear comparative basis our revenues for both 2008 and 2007 benefited as a result of changes in currency exchange rates primarily the euro and the japanese yen conversely our expenses were higher as a result of changes in these rates if 2008 and 2007 actual reported results were converted into us dollars based on the corresponding prior year’s foreign currency exchange rates revenue would have been lower by approximately 578 million and 212 million respectively while expenses would have been lower by approximately 377 million and 172 million respectively the net impact on yearoveryear results would have been a decrease in operating income of 201 million and 40 million in 2008 and 2007 respectively the results of operations revenue by line of business and revenue by geographic region in the tables that follow present both actual percentage changes year over year and percentage changes on a constant currency basis 

impact of reversal of valuation allowance 

net income for 2007 was significantly higher year over year due to a noncash tax benefit of 589 million recorded in the third quarter of 2007 primarily associated with our reversal of valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets in the us and a foreign jurisdiction 

overview 

the following is a summary of our results of operations for the last three years which includes the results of operations of companies we acquired beginning on their acquisition date 

 

 revenue increased from 2007 to 2008 primarily due to revenue from the cocreate business which we acquired on november 30 2007 and the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements as well as organic growth in maintenance and consulting and training service revenue 

revenue increased from 2006 to 2007 primarily due to organic revenue growth the favorable impact of foreign currency rate movements and a modest contribution from acquired businesses 

  

costs and expenses increased from 2007 to 2008 primarily due to costs of the cocreate business the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements measured spending increases to support planned revenue growth restructuring charges from our cost reduction and globalization measures and increased amortization of intangible assets and inprocess research and development charges associated with our acquisitions 

costs and expenses increased from 2006 to 2007 primarily due to the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements measured spending increases to support planned revenue growth and restructuring charges from our cost reduction and globalization measures 

refer to costs and expenses for a more detailed discussion total costs and expenses reflect the following 

 

  

  

 the provision for benefit from income taxes in 2007 and 2006 includes tax benefits totaling 628 million and 61 million respectively the 2007 benefit includes a 589 million tax benefit due to the reversal of a significant portion of our valuation allowances against deferred tax assets in the us and in a foreign jurisdiction and a 39 million tax benefit from the favorable outcome of a tax refund claim in the us the 2006 benefit resulted from favorable resolutions of tax audits with the internal revenue service in the us 

net income reflects improved operating margin contributions from increased revenue year over year offset by the impact of the items discussed above 

the following table shows certain consolidated financial data as a percentage of our total revenue for the last three years 

 

   

revenue 

our revenue consists of software license revenue and service revenue which includes software maintenance revenue consisting of providing our customers software updates and technical support as well as consulting and training revenue including implementation services 

total revenue 

the following table illustrates trends in our revenue from 2006 to 2008 

 

 revenue growth in 2008 reflects revenue from acquired businesses particularly cocreate as a standalone company cocreate generated revenue of approximately 78 million for the twelve months ended october 31 2007 cocreate revenue has been included in our results of operations since december 1 2007 accordingly results for 2007 did not include cocreate revenue while results for 2008 include ten months of cocreate revenue 

total revenue in 2008 and 2007 benefited from changes in foreign currency exchange rates due to the translation of revenue recorded in europe and asia into us dollars 

the increase in revenue in 2008 and 2007 also reflects 

 

  

  

  

 these increases were partially offset by declines in consulting and training service revenue related to our mcad solutions particularly in north america a portion of this decline was anticipated as we continue to expand our reseller and partner channel and their ability to offer these services to customers directly we also experienced lower than anticipated revenue from our computerbased training products 

revenue growth in 2007 also reflected revenue from mathsoft products we acquired mathsoft on april 28 2006 prior to our acquisition of that business mathsoft generated revenue of approximately 20 million for the 

  

twelve months ended march 31 2006 the mathsoft business has been included in our results of operations since its acquisition date accordingly 2006 results only include revenue from mathsoft products for approximately 5 months 

license revenue 

total 

license revenue accounted for 30 31 and 31 of total revenue in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively 

2008 compared to 2007 

license revenue in 2008 reflects growth in europe and japan partially offset by declines in north america and the pacific rim growth in license revenue in 2008 was primarily due to sales of acquired products mainly cocreate products and the impact of favorable currency movements 

in 2008 proengineer new seat license revenue growth was offset by a decrease in revenue from proengineer upgrades and modules we believe that our proengineer upgrades and modules license revenue in the first half of 2008 was negatively impacted by the end of the proengineer wildfire 30 product cycle and the launch of proengineer wildfire 40 in january 2008 as customers may have deferred purchases of those items until they have implemented wildfire 40 license sales of our data management and collaboration products were up 7 in 2008 primarily due to higher sales of pdmlink total windchill license revenue relative to the number of new seats varies quarter to quarter based on the type and volume of seats sold in 2008 we sold proportionately more light user seats which have a lower price than heavy user seats we believe this reflects increased adoption of windchill beyond the engineering organization as heavy user seats are used by engineers while light user seats are used outside the engineering function 

2007 compared to 2006 

the growth in license revenue in 2007 compared to 2006 reflected increased revenue from customers of all sizes and across both product categories growth in license revenue from our data management and collaboration products was primarily due to growth in sales of windchill pdmlink ®  our core windchill content and process management solution we believe growth in the number of new windchill seats sold in 2007 reflected our success in marketing incremental adoption of our solutions as well as our improved and expanded product offerings 

license sales of our mcad solutions products grew in 2007 primarily due to sales of mathcad and arbortext isodraw revenue from sales of proengineer was relatively flat from 2007 to 2006 with increases in new seat revenue offset by declines in sales of upgrades and modules 

maintenance revenue 

total 

maintenance revenue represented 46 43 and 44 of total revenue in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively growth in our maintenance revenue was primarily due to sales of acquired products and the impact of favorable foreign currency exchange rate movements as well as a higher number of seats under maintenance agreements although the number of seats under maintenance has been increasing this trend may not continue in the current macroeconomic climate and may be adversely affected to the extent customers do not continue maintenance for seats currently under maintenance due to layoffs or otherwise 

2008 compared to 2007 

the growth in maintenance revenue in 2008 reflects a 28 increase in seats under maintenance including a 4 increase in proengineer seats and a 28 increase in windchill seats in addition the growth reflects favorable foreign currency exchange rate movements and the addition of cocreate maintenance customers 

  

2007 compared to 2006 

the increase in our maintenance revenue in 2007 was due primarily to an increase in the number of new users of our data management and collaboration solutions products as new customers were added and existing customers expanded their implementations to additional users in addition maintenance revenue related to our mcad products grew in 2007 due to revenue contributions from our acquired products particularly mathcad an increase in seats under maintenance and favorable foreign currency exchange rate movements

consulting and training service revenue which has a lower gross profit margin than both license and maintenance revenue accounted for 24 of total revenue in 2008 and 25 of total revenue in both 2007 and 2006 we believe the decrease in consulting and training revenue as a percentage of overall revenue is due to a decline in mechanical computeraided design and engineering implementation consulting revenue due to our strategic use of channel and specialized partners to provide these services this initiative has enabled us to improve our consulting utilization and we intend to continue to pursue this approach in future quarters growth in total consulting and training services revenue is attributable to increased use by our customer base of our consulting and training services as well as contributions from acquired businesses partially offset by declines in consulting and training service revenue in north america as a result of declines in license revenue in that region 

2008 compared to 2007 

the increase in consulting and training service revenue reflects an increase in consulting revenue of approximately 10 and an increase in training revenue of 4 the increase in consulting and training service revenue in 2008 was primarily the result of continued growth in training services and windchill implementation consulting in europe and asiapacific partially offset by a decline in services revenue in north america europe’s growth continues to benefit from higher consulting revenue from a large customer and from favorable currency movements 

2007 compared to 2006 

the increase in our consulting and training service revenue in 2007 was due to increased customer demand for data management and collaboration solutions process and implementation consulting services as a result of increased adoption of our software solutions also during 2007 consulting and training revenue included a large customer engagement in europe which contributed to the growth in 2007 mcad solutions consulting and training service revenue declined primarily due to a decrease in consulting and training revenue in north america 

revenue from individual customers 

we enter into customer contracts that may result in revenue being recognized over multiple reporting periods accordingly revenue recognized in a current period may be attributable to contracts entered into during the current period or in prior periods license andor consulting and training service revenue of 1 million or more recognized from individual customers in a single quarter during the fiscal year was 1666 million 1567 million and 1380 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively while our customers may not continue to spend at these levels in future periods we believe this increase is the result of a shift in customer priorities toward plm solutions relative to other it spending initiatives our improved ability to provide broader solutions to our customers and improvements in our competitive position due to our system architecture and product development process knowledge 

  

revenue by geographic region 

 

 we derived 66 61 and 57 of our total revenue from sales to customers outside of north america in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively we believe the asiapacific region particularly china continues to present an important growth opportunity because global manufacturing companies have continued to invest in that region and the market in that region for both our mcad solutions and data management and collaboration solutions is relatively unsaturated economic growth in the united states slowed in 2008 and macroeconomic conditions deteriorated if economic growth in the united states continues to slow or if the economies of countries in europe or the asiapacific region slow customers may delay reduce or forego technology purchases this could result in reductions in sales of our products longer sales cycles slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition additionally in 2009 our revenue and operating results will be impacted by currency fluctuations the us dollar strengthened relative to the euro and the yen in the first two months of 2009 

2008 compared to 2007 

north america we derived 34 of our total revenue from sales to customers in north america in 2008 compared to 39 in 2007 revenue in north america in 2008 reflects declines in license and consulting and training service revenue offset by growth in maintenance revenue our reseller channel revenue grew in excess of 12 in north america in 2008 as we continued to increase our use of channel partners 

europe revenue in europe has been growing significantly for several quarters including revenue from the reseller channel growth in european revenue included growth in both organic revenue across all lines of business and revenue from acquired products particularly cocreate products additionally revenue was favorably impacted by foreign currency exchange rate movements european revenue in 2008 continued to include consulting service revenue from a large customer engagement 

asiapacific revenue in asiapacific in 2008 reflects 9 yearoveryear growth in the pacific rim and 21 growth in japan the increase in revenue in the pacific rim in 2008 was attributable to growth in maintenance and consulting and training service revenue growth in japan was primarily attributable to growth in license revenue and higher maintenance revenue from acquired products particularly cocreate products as well as the revenue from several large transactions our revenue in japan has historically included large customer transactions which fluctuate from period to period 

2007 compared to 2006 

north america we derived 39 of our total revenue from sales to customers in north america in 2007 compared to 43 in 2006 the results in 2007 in north america reflect growth in maintenance revenue and relatively flat license revenue offset by declines in consulting and training service revenue 

europe revenue in europe in 2007 reflected strong growth across most products and a benefit from foreign exchange rate movements in 2007 consulting and training revenue included a large customer engagement in europe which contributed to the growth 

  

asiapacific asiapacific revenue in 2007 compared to 2006 reflected an 11 increase in the pacific rim and a 12 increase in japan we believe that the growth in the pacific rim reflected improved market opportunity and better execution after strategic and organizational changes we made in that region early in 2006 we also made organizational and strategic changes in japan and believe these changes have helped improved our results there 

revenue from our reseller channel 

we have been building and diversifying our reseller channel to become less dependent on a small number of resellers and to provide the resources necessary for more effective distribution of our products we believe that using diverse and geographically dispersed resellers that focus on smaller businesses provides an efficient and cost effective means to reach these customers and allows our direct sales force to focus on larger sales opportunities total sales from our reseller channel were 2719 million in 2008 25 of total revenue 1952 million in 2007 21 of total revenue and 1715 million 20 of total revenue in 2006 we attribute the revenue increases from our reseller channel as a percentage of our total revenue to our efforts to expand our reseller channel to the success of proengineer wildfire among small and mediumsize businesses as proengineer wildfire has become increasingly competitive in this market both relative to our historic offerings as well as to competitive offerings in this market segment and to sales of acquired cocreate arbortext and mathsoft products in 2008 compared to 2007 growth came from all major geographic regions and was the result of organic revenue growth the addition of the cocreate channel and the impact of favorable foreign currency exchange rate movements in 2007 revenue growth was attributable to north america and europe and was the result of both organic growth and the impact of favorable foreign currency exchange rate movements 

costs and expenses 

over the past several years we have made significant investments to transform our business from providing a single line of technical software with a largely direct distribution model supplemented by a small number of channel partners to providing integrated product development system solutions with an expanded channel and partnerinvolved distribution model as part of this effort we have broadened our product development system through acquisitions and product development that have added costs and expenses 

operating margins 

our operating margins which benefited from favorable foreign currency exchange movements were 117 in 2008 99 in 2007 and 78 in 2006 over the past several years we have focused on achieving our operating margin goals while also continuing to invest in our strategic initiatives to support planned revenue growth and to fund revenuegenerating initiatives two key strategic initiatives that contributed to our operating margin improvement in 2008 were expansion of our distribution model and continued globalization of our workforce 

distribution model we expanded our reseller network in 2008 with the result that while we increased our sales and marketing headcount by 17 from the end of 2007 to the end of 2008 sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue decreased by more than 200 basis points in 2008 compared to 2007 we expect to continue to expand our reseller network and add more enterprise resellers particularly for our data management and collaboration products in both the smb and large enterprise markets with the goal of improving our operating margins and increasing our revenue 

globalization we are in the process of completing the relocation of certain business functions primarily research and development and finance to countries including china where we are seeking to enhance our business presence and where labor costs are lower as a result we have been able to add more research and development and general and administrative personnel while keeping these expense line items essentially flat as a percent of revenue with last year we expect continued globalization of our workforce primarily through investment in emerging economic regions as part of these efforts we have incurred the restructuring charges shown in the table below and described in “restructuring charges” below 

  

the following table illustrates trends from 2006 to 2008 in our costs and expenses 

 

  

 total costs and expenses 

2008 compared to 2007 

total costs and expenses increased to 9451 million in 2008 compared to 8485 million in 2007 total costs and expenses were adversely impacted by foreign currency exchange rates as costs and expenses incurred in europe and asiapacific were translated into us dollars headcount increased to 5087 at the end of 2008 compared to 4449 at the end of 2007 in addition costs and expenses in 2008 increased compared to 2007 primarily due to the following 

 

  

  

  

 2007 compared to 2006 

total costs and expenses increased to 8485 million in 2007 compared to 7815 million in 2006 total costs and expenses were adversely impacted by foreign currency exchange rates as costs and expenses incurred in europe were translated into us dollars headcount increased to 4449 at the end of 2007 from 4309 at the end of 2006 the increase in costs and expenses including headcount was primarily due to the following 

 

  

  

   

cost of license revenue 

 

 our cost of license revenue consists of fixed and variable costs associated with reproducing and distributing software and documentation as well as royalties paid to third parties for technology embedded in or licensed with our software products the increase in cost of license revenue in 2008 and 2007 compared to the prior year was due primarily to higher amortization of purchased and capitalized software of approximately 125 million and 17 million respectively primarily attributable to the acquisitions of cocreate in 2008 and mathsoft in 2006 cost of license revenue as a percent of license revenue can vary depending on product mix sold and the effect of fixed and variable royalties and the level of amortization of acquired software intangible assets 

cost of service revenue 

 

 our cost of service revenue includes costs associated with training customer support and consulting personnel such as salaries and related costs thirdparty subcontractor fees costs associated with the release of maintenance updates including related royalty costs and facility costs service margins can vary based on the product mix sold in the period service margins improved in 2008 primarily due to a higher mix of maintenance revenue maintenance revenue comprised 66 of total service revenue in 2008 compared to 63 in 2007 margins on maintenance revenue are significantly higher than on consulting and training service revenue yearend headcount for 2008 includes increases from acquisitions as well as increases in our services delivery capacity in certain regions yearend headcount for 2007 reflects employee terminations that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2007 actual average headcount was approximately 11 higher in 2007 compared to 2006 total salaries commissions benefits and travel costs were higher by an aggregate of approximately 165 million and 97 million in 2008 and 2007 respectively compared to the prior year including an increase of 18 million and a decrease of 01 million in 2008 and 2007 respectively related to stockbased compensation the cost of thirdparty consulting services was 112 million and 49 million higher in 2008 and 2007 respectively compared to the prior year periods due to the use of such services in support of increases in consulting and training services revenue 

sales and marketing 

 

 our sales and marketing expenses primarily include salaries and benefits sales commissions advertising and marketing programs travel and facility costs total salaries commissions benefits and travel costs were 

  

higher by an aggregate of approximately 160 million and 135 million in 2008 and 2007 respectively compared to the prior year including an increase of 32 million and a decrease of 06 million in 2008 and 2007 respectively related to stockbased compensation sales and marketing costs were higher in 2008 and 2007 due to planned increases including by acquisition in headcount and higher commissions due primarily to increased license and service revenue 

research and development 

 

 our research and development expenses consist principally of salaries and benefits costs of computer equipment and facility expenses major research and development activities include developing new releases of our software that work together in a more integrated fashion and that include functionality enhancements yearend headcount includes increases from acquisitions as well as increased staffing for certain research and development initiatives total salaries benefits and travel costs were higher in 2008 and 2007 compared to the prior year by an aggregate of approximately 166 million and 145 million respectively including an increase of 22 million and a decrease of 14 million in 2008 and 2007 respectively related to stockbased compensation 

general and administrative 

 

 our general and administrative ga expenses include the costs of our corporate finance information technology human resources legal and administrative functions as well as bad debt expense ga expenses also include costs associated with outside professional services including accounting and legal fees total salaries benefits and travel costs were higher in 2008 and 2007 compared to the prior year by an aggregate of approximately 59 million and 35 million respectively including increases of 08 million and 03 million for 2008 and 2007 respectively related to stockbased compensation our ga expenses in 2008 included approximately 28 million of costs for outside professional services incurred primarily in connection with an audit committee investigation and restatement of prior period financial statements completed in the first quarter our ga expenses in 2007 included costs for outside professional services incurred in connection with our corporate development initiatives including 17 million related to potential acquisitions that did not close additionally ga expenses in 2007 included 11 million for professional fees incurred primarily in connection with our audit committee investigation our ga expenses in 2006 included costs for outside professional services totaling 25 million incurred in connection with our investigation in the asiapacific region described in our 2005 annual report on form 10k and included a 23 million charge related to our settlement of litigation with rand a technology a former distributor of our products 

amortization of acquired intangible assets 

 

   

the amortization of acquired intangible assets line item on our statements of operations reflects the amortization of acquired nonproduct related intangible assets primarily customer and trademarkrelated intangible assets recorded as a result of our acquisitions the increase in 2008 compared to 2007 and 2006 was primarily due to amortization of intangible assets resulting from the cocreate acquisition completed in the first quarter of 2008 we expect amortization of nonproduct related intangible assets from our completed acquisitions to total approximately 154 million in 2009 

our acquisitions of cocreate and lbs in the first quarter of 2008 resulted in an increase in acquired intangible assets of 1417 million acquired intangible assets consisted of 761 million of customer relationship intangibles 621 million of purchased software 23 million of trademarks and 12 million of noncompete agreements and other which are being amortized over estimated weighted average useful lives of 811 years 8 years 9 years and 155 years respectively 

our acquisitions of nc graphics itedo and the assets of netregulus completed in 2007 resulted in an increase in acquired intangibles of 164 million acquired intangible assets consisted of 31 million of customer relationship intangibles 131 million of purchased software and 02 million of other intangibles which are being amortized over estimated weighted average useful lives of 9 years 5 years and 3 years respectively 

our acquisition of mathsoft in the third quarter of 2006 resulted in an increase in acquired intangible assets of 256 million acquired intangible assets consisted of 139 million of customer relationship intangibles 103 million of purchased software and 14 million of trademarks and distributor networks which are being amortized over estimated weighted average useful lives of 7 to 10 years 5 years and 5 years respectively 

our acquisitions of denc ag and substantially all of the assets of cadtrain inc in the first quarter of 2006 resulted in acquired intangible assets of 59 million primarily comprised of customer relationship intangibles which are being amortized over a weighted average of 83 years 

inprocess research and development 

 

 these costs are related to acquired research and development projects that were in process at the respective acquisition date and for which technological feasibility had not yet been established and for which there was no alternative future use the value of the purchased inprocess research and development was determined using the residual income approach which discounts expected future cash flows from projects under development to their net present value 

the inprocess research and development charge in 2008 was from our cocreate and dhi acquisitions in 2007 was from our nc graphics acquisition and in 2006 was from our mathsoft acquisition 

restructuring and other charges 

 

   

primarily as a result of our globalization initiative described above and the integration of cocreate we incurred restructuring charges in 2008 described below we do not expect to incur any restructuring charges in 2009 related to these initiatives 

restructuring charges in the periods reported were primarily associated with reductions in workforce and excess facility obligations to reduce our cost structure and to improve profitability in 2008 2007 and 2006 we made cash payments related to restructuring and other charges including payments relating to restructuring and other charges recorded prior to 2006 of 251 million 147 million and 152 million respectively amounts not yet paid at september 30 2008 relating to restructuring and other charges taken during the current and all prior periods were 177 million and primarily relate to excess facility obligations to be paid out through 2013 of the total amount accrued at september 30 2008 we expect to make cash disbursements within the next twelve months of approximately 14 million for restructuring charges incurred in 2008 and prior periods 

the 2008 charges included 107 million for severance and related costs associated with 185 employees notified of termination during 2008 and 79 million of costs related to excess facilities in addition in 2008 we recorded 15 million for costs incurred in connection with our integration of cocreate 

in the fourth quarter of 2007 we recorded a restructuring charge of 153 million the restructuring charge included a 132 million charge for severance and related costs associated with 262 employees notified of termination during the quarter and 21 million related to excess facilities the charges for excess facilities were primarily related to gross lease commitments in excess of estimated sublease income for excess facilities 

in 2006 we recorded a net restructuring charge of 59 million the net restructuring charge included 74 million of severance and related costs associated with 91 employees notified of termination during the period partially offset by a credit of 15 million primarily related to a plan to reoccupy a portion of our headquarters facility that was previously vacated and had been included in restructuring costs in prior periods the headquarters space was available for sublease and was being marketed but was reoccupied due to space requirements related to our acquisition of mathsoft 

nonoperating income expense 

 

 interest income 

interest income represents earnings on the investment of our available cash balances interest income in 2008 reflects a modest increase in average cash balances over 2007 the increase in 2007 compared to 2006 was related primarily to higher average cash balances and higher interest rates 

interest expense 

interest expense is primarily related to interest on borrowings under our revolving credit facility in 2008 we borrowed 220 million under the credit facility in connection with our acquisition of cocreate at an average rate of approximately 55 as of september 30 2008 we had repaid approximately 132 million of the original amount borrowed prior to 2008 we did not have any outstanding borrowings under this credit facility 

  

other expense net 

other expense net includes costs of hedging contracts certain realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains or losses and foreign exchange gains or losses resulting from the required periodend currency remeasurement of the assets and liabilities of our subsidiaries that use the us dollar as their functional currency a large portion of our revenue and expenses is transacted in foreign currencies to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates we engage in hedging transactions involving the use of foreign currency forward contracts primarily in western european and asian currencies the increase in other expense net in 2008 was due primarily to a 62 million noncash loss described below and higher foreign exchange losses partially offset by a onetime benefit of 13 million related to a legal settlement the increase in other expense net in 2007 was due primarily to higher foreign exchange losses and other expense of 07 million recorded in 2007 related to the settlement of a disputed obligation from a previously divested business unit 

in the third quarter of 2008 we liquidated eight whollyowned subsidiaries resulting in a 62 million noncash loss the noncash loss resulted from the reclassification of the net cumulative translation adjustment from accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings for these liquidated subsidiaries the loss related to these subsidiaries was recorded in other expense net in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for 2008 reflects an offsetting gain of 62 million resulting from the reclassification 

income taxes 

our income tax provision has fluctuated significantly in terms of amount and rate in each of the past three years due primarily to the impact of discrete events such as the release of a substantial portion of the us valuation allowance and the settlements of tax audits which created onetime income tax benefits in 2008 our effective tax rate was a provision of 330 on pretax income of 1189 million compared to a benefit of 441 in 2007 on pretax income of 997 million and a provision of 191 in 2006 on pretax income of 702 million in 2008 our effective tax rate of 330 was lower than the 35 statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to the benefit of foreign taxes paid at a net effective tax rate lower than that in the us the net tax benefit recorded in 2007 was principally due to a tax benefit of 589 million recorded upon our decision in the third quarter of 2007 to release a substantial portion of the valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets in the us and a foreign jurisdiction as well as a net tax benefit of 39 million recorded in the third quarter of 2007 from the favorable outcome of a tax refund claim in the us in 2006 our effective tax rate of 191 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate of 35 due primarily to a 61 million benefit recorded upon settlement of prior year tax audits in the us discussed below as well as our use of net operating loss carryforwards nols to offset our 2006 us taxable income which reduced the valuation allowance we had previously recorded against those nols excluding the effect of these onetime tax benefits our income tax provisions in 2008 2007 and 2006 consisted primarily of taxes owed in relation to the income generated by our foreign subsidiaries as well as withholding taxes that we incurred in the us in connection with certain foreign operations 

as of the end of the second quarter of 2007 a full valuation allowance was recorded against our net deferred tax assets consisting primarily of net operating loss carryforwards in the us and certain foreign jurisdictions based upon our operating results for the years immediately preceding and through june 30 2007 as well as an assessment of our expected future results of operations during the third quarter of 2007 we determined that it had become more likely than not that we would realize a substantial portion of our net deferred tax assets in the us and a foreign jurisdiction as a result during the third quarter of 2007 we released a total of 798 million of our valuation allowances of the 798 million valuation allowance release 589 million was recorded as a onetime income tax benefit 200 million was recorded as a reduction to goodwill recorded upon prior acquisitions and 09 million was recorded as a decrease to accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders’ equity 

  

as of september 30 2008 we have a remaining valuation allowance of 422 million against net deferred tax assets in the us and a remaining valuation allowance of 238 million against net deferred tax assets in certain foreign jurisdictions the valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets in the us consists of 302 million for foreign tax credits 26 million for research and development credits and 27 million for capital losses that we have determined are not more likely than not to be realized 66 million for stockbased compensation deductions that will be credited to additional paidin capital only when realized and 01 million for certain state operating loss carryforwards that will likely expire without being utilized the valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets of certain foreign jurisdictions is established primarily for our net operating loss carryforwards that will likely expire without being utilized 

in the normal course of business ptc and its subsidiaries are examined by various taxing authorities including the internal revenue service irs in the united states we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate we are currently under audit by tax authorities in the us and several foreign jurisdictions audits by tax authorities typically involve examination of the deductibility of certain permanent items limitations on net operating losses and tax credits although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in material changes in our estimates we recorded a net tax benefit of 39 million in the third quarter of 2007 from the favorable outcome of a tax refund claim in the us in 2006 we reached final agreement with the irs and made federal income tax payments totaling 95 million for liabilities arising from our income tax returns for fiscal years 2001 and 2002 as a result of this final agreement and the tax payments made being less than the accrued income taxes that we had recorded for those years we recorded an income tax benefit in 2006 of 61 million 

our future effective tax rate may be materially impacted by the amount of income taxes associated with our foreign earnings which are taxed at rates different from the us federal statutory rate as well as the timing and extent of the realization of deferred tax assets and changes in the tax law further our tax rate may fluctuate within a fiscal year including from quarter to quarter due to items arising from discrete events including settlements of tax audits and assessments the resolution or identification of tax position uncertainties and acquisitions of other companies 

in november 2008 we completed a realignment of our european business which resulted in a onetime taxable gain in the us we expect this realignment will result in the utilization of the majority of our us federal nol carryforwards in 2009 we do not expect this realignment to negatively impact our effective tax rate due in part to this transaction resulting in our ability to recognize previously reserved us deferred tax assets this realignment had no impact on our consolidated financial statements for the year ended september 30 2008 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we have prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america in preparing our financial statements we make estimates assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our reported revenues results from operations and net income as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet these estimates assumptions and judgments about future events and their effects on our results cannot be determined with certainty and are made based on our historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances these estimates may change as new events occur or additional information is obtained and we may periodically be faced with uncertainties the outcomes of which are not within our control and may not be known for a prolonged period of time 

the accounting policies methods and estimates used to prepare our financial statements are described generally in note b of “notes to consolidated financial statements” the most important critical accounting judgments and estimates that we made in preparing the financial statements involved 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

 a critical accounting policy is one that is both material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires us to make difficult subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate and different estimates that we could have used or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process actual results could differ from those estimates 

accounting policies guidelines and interpretations related to our critical accounting policies and estimates are generally subject to numerous sources of authoritative guidance and are often reexamined by accounting standards rule makers and regulators these rule makers andor regulators may promulgate interpretations guidance or regulations that may result in changes to our accounting policies which could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 

revenue recognition 

primarily we apply the guidance of statement of position sop no 972 software revenue recognition and statement of position no 989 modification of sop 972 software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions both issued by the american institute of certified public accountants in applying sop 972 we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with determining the amounts of software license and services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period 

our primary judgments involve the following 

 

  

  

  

 we derive revenues from three primary sources 1 software licenses 2 maintenance services and 3 consulting and training services revenue by type for 2008 2007 and 2006 was as follows 

 

   

for software license arrangements that do not require significant modification or customization of the underlying software we recognize revenue when 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 2 delivery has occurred generally fob shipping point or electronic distribution 3 the fee is fixed or determinable and 4 collection is probable substantially all of our license revenues are recognized in this manner 

our software is distributed primarily through our direct sales force in addition we have an indirect distribution channel through alliances with resellers and for our mathsoft products with distributors approximately 25 of our total revenue in 2008 was generated from our indirect distributor channel revenue arrangements with resellers are recognized on a sellthrough basis that is when we deliver the product to the enduser customer we do not offer contractual rights of return stock balancing or price protection to our resellers and actual product returns from them have been insignificant to date as a result we do not maintain reserves for reseller product returns and related allowances in contrast revenue arrangements with distributors of our mathsoft products have a contractual right to exchange product and are recognized on a sellin basis that is when we ship the products to the distributor as of september 30 2008 2007 and 2006 the value of mathsoft product inventory held by distributors and the accrual that we have recorded for estimated product returns were not material 

at the time of each sale transaction we must make an assessment of the collectibility of the amount due from the customer revenue is only recognized at that time if management deems that collection is probable in making this assessment we consider customer creditworthiness and historical payment experience at that same time we assess whether fees are fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties if the fee is not fixed or determinable revenue is recognized only as payments become due from the customer provided that all other revenue recognition criteria are met in assessing whether the fee is fixed or determinable we consider the payment terms of the transaction including transactions with payment terms that extend beyond our customary payment terms and our collection experience in similar transactions without making concessions among other factors our software license arrangements generally do not include customer acceptance provisions however if an arrangement includes an acceptance provision we record revenue only upon the earlier of 1 receipt of written acceptance from the customer or 2 expiration of the acceptance period 

our software arrangements often include implementation and consulting services that are sold separately under consulting engagement contracts or as part of the software license arrangement when we determine that such services are not essential to the functionality of the licensed software and qualify as “service transactions” under sop 972 we record revenue separately for the license and service elements of these arrangements provided that appropriate evidence of fair value exists for the undelivered services see discussion below generally we consider that a service is not essential to the functionality of the software based on various factors including if the services may be provided by independent third parties experienced in providing such consulting and implementation in coordination with dedicated customer personnel and whether the services result in any modification or customization of the software functionality if an arrangement does not qualify for separate accounting of the license and service elements then license revenue is recognized together with the consulting services using either the percentageofcompletion or completedcontract method of contract accounting contract accounting for both license and service elements is also applied to any software arrangements that include customerspecific acceptance criteria or where the license payment is tied to the performance of consulting services under the percentageof completion method we estimate the stage of completion of contracts with fixed or “not to exceed” fees based on hours or costs incurred to date as compared with estimated total project hours or costs at completion if we do not have a sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion revenue is recognized upon completion of the contract when total cost estimates exceed revenues we accrue for the estimated losses when identified the use of the percentageofcompletion method of accounting requires significant judgment relative to estimating total contract costs including assumptions relative to the length of time to complete the project the nature and complexity of the work to be performed and anticipated changes in salaries and other costs when adjustments in estimated contract costs are determined such revisions may have the effect of adjusting in the current period the earnings applicable to performance in prior periods 

  

we generally use the residual method to recognize revenues from arrangements that include one or more elements to be delivered at a future date when evidence of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists under the residual method the fair value of the undelivered elements ie maintenance consulting and training services based on vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe is deferred and the remaining portion of the total arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements ie software license if evidence of the fair value of one or more of the undelivered services does not exist all revenues are deferred and recognized when delivery of all of those services has occurred or when fair values can be established we determine vsoe of the fair value of services revenues based upon our recent pricing for those services when sold separately for certain transactions vsoe of the fair value of maintenance services is determined based on a substantive maintenance renewal clause within a customer contract our current pricing practices are influenced primarily by product type purchase volume maintenance term and customer location we review services sold separately and maintenance renewal rates on a periodic basis and update when appropriate our vsoe of fair value for such services to ensure that it reflects our recent pricing experience any increase in our vsoe assumptions of the fair value of maintenance services or consulting and training services would decrease the amount allocated to license revenue 

accounting for income taxes 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to calculate our income tax expense based on taxable income by jurisdiction there are many transactions and calculations about which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain as a result our calculations involve estimates by management some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenuesharing costreimbursement and transfer pricing arrangements among related entities and the differing tax treatment of revenue and cost items across various jurisdictions if we were compelled to revise or to account differently for our arrangements that revision could affect our tax liability 

the income tax accounting process also involves estimating our actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheets we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized we must establish a valuation allowance as a charge to income tax expense 

in the normal course of business ptc and its subsidiaries are examined by various taxing authorities including the internal revenue service irs in the united states we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate we are currently under audit by tax authorities in the us and several foreign jurisdictions audits by tax authorities typically involve examination of the deductibility of certain permanent items limitations on net operating losses and tax credits although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in material changes in our estimates 

as of september 30 2008 we have a remaining valuation allowance of 660 million against net deferred tax assets the valuation allowance includes 422 million in the us against net deferred tax assets consisting primarily of foreign tax credits the valuation allowance also includes 238 million recorded against net deferred tax assets in certain foreign jurisdictions consisting primarily of net operating loss carryforwards that will likely expire without being utilized 

valuation of assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations 

in accordance with business combination accounting we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and inprocess research and development based on their estimated fair values determining these fair values requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets 

  

our identifiable intangible assets acquired consist of developed technology core technology tradenames customer lists and contracts software support agreements and related relationships and consulting contracts developed technology consists of products that have reached technological feasibility core technology represents a combination of processes inventions and trade secrets related to the design and development of acquired products customer lists and contracts and software support agreements and related relationships represent the underlying relationships and agreements with customers of the acquired company’s installed base we have generally valued intangible assets using a discounted cash flow model critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to 

 

  

  

  

 in addition we estimate the useful lives of our intangible assets based upon the expected period over which we anticipate generating economic benefits from the related intangible asset 

net tangible assets consist of the fair values of tangible assets less the fair values of assumed liabilities and obligations except for deferred revenues and restructuring reserves net tangible assets were generally valued by us at the respective carrying amounts recorded by the acquired company as we believed that their carrying values approximated their fair values at the acquisition date 

the values assigned to deferred revenue reflect an amount equivalent to the estimated cost plus an appropriate profit margin to perform the services related to the acquired company’s software support contracts restructuring reserves include the severance costs related to employees of the acquired company planned closure of certain facilities and other costs associated with exiting activities of the acquired company 

our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable at that time but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions estimates or actual results 

valuation of goodwill and acquired intangible assets 

our goodwill and net acquired intangible assets totaled 5875 million and 3251 million as of september 30 2008 and 2007 respectively as described in note n of “notes to consolidated financial statements” we have two reporting units 1 our software products segment and 2 our services segment as of september 30 2008 and 2007 goodwill and acquired intangible assets in the aggregate attributable to our software products segment was 5632 million and 2999 million respectively and attributable to our services segment was 243 million and 252 million respectively 

we assess the impairment of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets on at least an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable factors we consider important on an overall company basis and reportable segment basis as applicable that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results significant changes in our use of the acquired assets or a significant change in 

  

the strategy for our business significant negative industry or economic trends a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period or a reduction of our market capitalization relative to net book value 

the goodwill impairment test prescribed by sfas 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires us to identify reporting units and to determine estimates of the fair values of our reporting units as of the date we test for impairment to conduct these tests of goodwill the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value if the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeded its fair value we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value of goodwill and its implied fair value we estimate the fair values of our reporting units using discounted cash flow valuation models those models require estimates of future revenues profits capital expenditures working capital and discount rates for each reporting unit we estimate these amounts by evaluating historical trends current budgets operating plans and industry data we conduct our annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite lived assets as of the end of the third quarter of each fiscal year we completed our annual impairment review as of june 28 2008 and concluded that no impairment charge was required as of that date revenue and operating margin projections are significant assumptions in our analysis adjusting those assumptions by 10 would not have had an impact on the results of our impairment analysis 

for longlived assets and identifiable intangible assets other than goodwill we reassess the recoverability of the asset based on projected undiscounted future cash flows over the asset’s remaining life if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reportable segment below its carrying value when the carrying value of the asset exceeds its undiscounted cash flows we record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset determined using projected discounted future cash flows of the asset determining the fair value of our reporting units for the purpose of testing the potential impairment of individual assets and goodwill requires significant judgment by management different judgments could yield different results 

accounting for pensions 

in the us we sponsor a frozen pension plan covering mostly inactive participants we make several assumptions that are used in calculating the expense and liability of this plan these key assumptions include the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate in selecting the expected longterm rate of return on assets we consider the average future rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits under the pension plan this includes considering the plan’s asset allocations and the expected returns likely to be earned over the life of this plan the discount rate reflects the estimated rate at which an amount that is invested in a portfolio of highquality debt instruments would provide the future cash flows necessary to pay benefits when they come due in addition our actuarial consultants determine the expense and liabilities of the plan using other assumptions for future experience such as mortality rates the actuarial assumptions used by us may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions or longer or shorter life spans of the participants our actual results could differ materially from those we estimated which could require us to record a greater amount of pension expense in future years in determining our pension cost for 2008 2007 and 2006 we used a discount rate of 625 575 and 550 respectively and an expected return on plan assets of 750 for each year 

certain of our foreign subsidiaries also sponsor pension plans accounting and reporting for these plans requires the use of countryspecific assumptions for discount rates and expected rates of return on assets we apply a consistent methodology in determining the key assumptions that in addition to future experience assumptions such as mortality rates are used by our actuaries to determine our liability and expense for each of these plans in determining our pension cost for 2008 2007 and 2006 we used weighted average discount rates of 52 47 and 46 respectively and a weighted average expected return on plan assets of 57 38 and 39 respectively 

in 2008 and 2007 our actual return on plan assets was a loss of 132 million and a gain of 63 million respectively recent distress in the financial markets has had an adverse impact on financial market activities 

  

including among other things extreme volatility in security prices severely diminished liquidity and credit availability rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuation of others subsequent to year end through october 31 2008 the fair value of our pension assets have declined further and returns are significantly below our expected rates of return if actual returns continue to be below our expected rate of return it will impact the amount and timing of future contributions and expense for these plans 

the most sensitive assumptions used in calculating the expense and liability of our pension plans are the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets a 50 basis point change to our discount rate and expected return on plan assets assumptions would have changed our pension expense for the year ended september 30 2008 by approximately 15 million a 50 basis point decrease in our discount rate assumptions would increase our projected benefit obligation as of september 30 2008 by approximately 90 million 

allowance for accounts and other receivables 

management judgment is required in assessing the collectibility of customer accounts and other receivables for which we generally do not require collateral we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments in determining the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts management specifically analyzes individual accounts receivable historical bad debts customer concentrations customer creditworthiness current economic conditions accounts receivable aging trends and changes in our customer payment terms our customer base consists of large numbers of geographically diverse customers dispersed across many industries and no individual customer comprised more than 10 of our net accounts receivable for any period presented the following table summarizes our accounts receivable and related reserve balances at september 30 2008 and 2007 

 

 if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate additional allowances might be required resulting in future operating expenses that are not included in the allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for bad debts as a percentage of gross accounts receivable can vary depending on the level and timing of quarterly revenue as well as the timing of the resolution of specifically reserved doubtful accounts receivable either via collection or writeoff 

restructuring charges 

we periodically record restructuring charges resulting from restructuring our operations including consolidations andor relocations of operations changes to our strategic plan or managerial responses to declines in demand increasing costs or other market factors the determination of restructuring charges requires management judgment and may include costs related to employee benefits such as costs of severance and termination benefits and estimates of costs for future lease commitments on excess facilities net of estimated future sublease income in determining the amount of the facilities charge we are required to estimate such factors as future vacancy rates the time required to sublet properties and sublease rates these estimates are reviewed quarterly based on known real estate market conditions and the creditworthiness of subtenants and may result in revisions to established facility reserves we had accrued 117 million as of september 30 2008 related to excess facilities compared to 169 million at september 30 2007 representing gross lease commitments with agreements expiring at various dates through 2013 of approximately 257 million net of 

  

committed and estimated sublease income of approximately 138 million and a present value factor of 02 million we have entered into signed sublease arrangements for approximately 132 million with the remaining 06 million based on future estimated sublease arrangements if our sublease assumptions prove to be inaccurate we may need to make changes in these estimates that would affect our results of operations and potentially our financial condition 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

 we invest our cash with highly rated financial institutions and in diversified domestic and international money market mutual funds the portfolio is invested in shortterm instruments to ensure cash is available to meet requirements as needed 

cash and cash equivalents 

the decrease in cash and cash equivalents in 2008 compared to 2007 was due primarily to cash paid to acquire businesses of 2616 million 254 million for additions to property and equipment and 273 million used to repurchase common stock partially offset by 2222 million of cash provided by operations and 881 million of net borrowings under our revolving credit facility the increase in cash and cash equivalents in 2007 was due primarily to 1274 million of cash provided by operations and 91 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock net of cash paid for withholding taxes in connection with settlement of restricted stock units partially offset by 311 million paid for acquisitions 241 million for additions to property and equipment and 100 million used to repurchase common stock 

cash provided by operating activities 

2008 compared to 2007 

the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to 

 

  

   

dso at the end of 2007 was adversely affected by the timing of revenue recorded and the impact of extended payment term deals we offered to customers during 2007 and 2006 we offer these terms to some customers with established payment and credit histories 

we provided extended payment terms on internally financed transactions accounting for approximately 26 million of revenue in both 2008 and 2007 and 51 million of revenue in 2006 other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets include noncurrent receivables from customers related to extended payment term contracts totaling 163 million and 253 million at september 30 2008 and 2007 respectively 

2007 compared to 2006 

the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to 

 

  

 days sales outstanding dso was 74 days as of september 30 2007 compared to 67 days as of september 30 2006 

cash used by investing activities 

in 2008 we paid net of cash acquired 2475 million for cocreate 131 million for lbs and 10 million for dhi in 2007 we paid net of cash acquired 67 million for nc graphics 166 million for itedo 23 million for netregulus and 15 million related to the cadtrain acquisition in 2006 we paid net of cash acquired 644 million for mathsoft 99 million for the denc and cadtrain acquisitions and 08 million related to the arbortext acquisition further during 2007 we acquired the remaining equity interest in a controlled subsidiary for 40 million cash used for additions to property equipment and intangible assets was 254 million 241 million and 195 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively our expenditures for property and equipment consist primarily of computer equipment software office equipment and facility improvements 

cash provided used by financing activities 

the increase in cash provided by financing activities 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily due to 881 million of net borrowings under our revolving credit facility that increase was partially offset by 273 million used to repurchase common stock in 2008 compared to 100 million in 2007 lower proceeds from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans which were 127 million in 2008 compared to 156 million in 2007 and 107 million of cash used to pay employee withholding taxes related to restricted stock and restricted stock units that vested during 2008 compared to 65 million in 2007 the increase in cash used by financing activities in 2007 compared to 2006 was due primarily to the repurchase of common stock for 100 million cash proceeds from the issuance of our common stock under our stock plans were 127 million 156 million and 78 million 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively during 2008 2007 and 2006 we used 107 million 65 million and 01 million respectively to pay employee withholding taxes related to restricted stock units that vested during the period in lieu of issuing shares to employees with respect to those awards cash provided by financing activities in 2006 was net of 09 million of costs incurred to obtain our revolving credit facility described below 

  

share repurchase authorization 

on may 14 2008 our board of directors authorized us to use up to 50 million of cash from operations to repurchase shares of our common stock in the form of open market purchases and on november 20 2008 increased that amount to 100 million this authorization revoked all previous share repurchase authorizations and will expire on may 14 2009 unless earlier revoked in 2008 we repurchased 17 million shares for 273 million including 03 million shares at a cost of 53 million under the current authorization additionally in the first quarter of 2009 through november 25 2008 we repurchased 03 million shares at a cost of 33 million future repurchases of shares will reduce our cash balances 

credit facility 

subject to the terms of the credit facility agreement we may borrow funds up to 230 million repay the same in whole or in part and reborrow at any time through february 20 2011 when all amounts outstanding will be due and payable in full although we have the contractual right to borrow these funds under the credit facility conditions in the credit markets may preclude our ability to draw those funds if we were to seek to do so 

on november 28 2007 in connection with our acquisition of cocreate we borrowed 220 million under our credit facility in two tranches 36 million that accrued interest at the eurodollarbased borrowing rate and an alternate currency loan of 1246 million euros equivalent to 184 million at the borrowing date we repaid the 36 million loan in full in the first six months of 2008 and we repaid 617 million euros of the alternate currency loan in 2008 as of september 30 2008 the amount outstanding under the revolving credit facility was 629 million euros which was equivalent to 885 million on that date 

the current loan matures on november 28 2008 and accrues interest at 57175 per annum upon the due date and subsequent due dates we may either repay the amount outstanding or roll over the amount outstanding with new short term loans at the then current interest rates under the credit facility 

for a description of the terms and conditions of the credit facility including limitations on our ability to undertake certain actions see “note h commitments and contingencies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10k 

expectations for fiscal 2009 

we believe that existing cash and cash equivalents together with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements through at least the next twelve months 

during 2009 we expect to use cash to repurchase our shares and may use cash to reduce amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility capital expenditures are currently anticipated to be approximately 26 million in addition we expect to make cash disbursements estimated at 14 million for restructuring charges incurred in 2008 and prior periods 

we have evaluated and expect to continue to evaluate possible strategic transactions on an ongoing basis and at any given time may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to possible strategic transactions our cash position could be reduced and we may incur additional debt obligations to the extent we complete any significant transactions 

  

contractual obligations 

we lease office facilities and certain equipment under operating leases that expire at various dates through 2014 including an operating lease agreement related to our headquarters office in needham massachusetts entered into in 2000 which expires in december 2012 subject to certain renewal rights these leases qualify for operating lease accounting treatment and as such are not included on our balance sheet at september 30 2008 our contractual obligations including future minimum lease payments net of sublease income under noncancellable operating leases are as follows 

 

  

    in november 2008 we entered into a lease agreement in the us for one of our research and development centers for approximately 90000 square feet of office space under construction which we expect to occupy in september 2009 the lease has an initial term of ten and a half years with total gross minimum lease payments of 155 million due under the lease 

as of september 30 2008 we had letters of credit and bank guarantees outstanding of approximately 48 million of which 17 million was collateralized primarily related to the lease of our headquarters in needham massachusetts 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have not created and are not party to any specialpurpose or offbalance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital incurring debt or operating parts of our business that are not consolidated to the extent of our ownership interest therein into our financial statements we have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby we have subordinated retained interests derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks contingent liabilities or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing liquidity market risk or credit risk support to us 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in accordance with recently issued accounting pronouncements we will be required to comply with certain changes in accounting rules and regulations 

determining whether instruments granted in sharebased payment transactions are participating securities 

in june 2008 the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp eitf 0361 determining whether instruments granted in sharebased payment transactions are participating securities eitf 0361 eitf 0361 provides that unvested sharebased payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents whether paid or unpaid are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the twoclass method upon adoption a company is required to retrospectively adjust its earnings per share data including any amounts related to interim periods summaries of earnings and selected financial data to conform with the provisions in eitf 0361 we will be subject to eitf 0361 beginning in fiscal 2010 which begins on october 1 2009 we have not yet determined the impact if any of eitf 0361 on our consolidated financial statements 

disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities 

in march 2008 the fasb issued statement no 161 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 161 the new standard is intended to improve financial reporting about derivative instruments and hedging activities by requiring enhanced disclosures to enable investors to better understand their effects on an entity’s financial position financial performance and cash flows sfas 161 requires disclosure of the fair values of derivative instruments and their gains and losses in a tabular format it also provides more information about an entity’s liquidity by requiring disclosure of derivative features that are credit riskrelated finally it requires crossreferencing within footnotes to enable financial statement users to locate important information about derivative instruments it is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2008 and interim periods within those years with early adoption encouraged we do not believe the adoption of sfas 161 in our fiscal 2010 will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

business combinations 

in december 2007 the fasb issued statement no 141r business combinations sfas 141r and statement no 160 accounting and reporting of noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb no 51 sfas 160 these statements will significantly change the financial accounting and reporting of business combination transactions and noncontrolling or minority interests in consolidated financial statements sfas 141r requires companies to i recognize with certain exceptions 100 of the fair values of assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in acquisitions of less than a 100 controlling interest when the acquisition constitutes a change in control of the acquired entity ii measure acquirer shares issued in consideration for a business combination at fair value on the acquisition date iii recognize contingent consideration arrangements at their acquisitiondate fair values with subsequent 

  

changes in fair value generally reflected in earnings iv with certain exceptions recognize preacquisition loss and gain contingencies at their acquisitiondate fair values v capitalize inprocess research and development assets acquired vi expense as incurred acquisitionrelated transaction costs and vii capitalize acquisition related restructuring costs only if the criteria in sfas 146 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  are met as of the acquisition date in addition changes in accounting for deferred tax asset valuation allowances and acquired income tax uncertainties after the measurement period will be recognized in earnings rather than as an adjustment to the cost of acquisition 

sfas 141r is required to be adopted concurrently with sfas 160 and is effective for business combination transactions for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december 15 2008 we will be subject to sfas 141r beginning in fiscal 2010 which begins on october 1 2009 early adoption of these statements is prohibited we believe the adoption of these statements will have a material effect on the financial accounting for any significant acquisitions completed after october 1 2009 

determination of the useful lives of intangible assets 

in april 2008 the fasb issued fasb staff position no1423 determination of useful lives of intangible assets fsp 1423 fsp 1423 amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas 142 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 142 fsp 1423 is intended to improve consistency between the useful life of an intangible asset determined under sfas 142 and the expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under sfas 141r and other us generally accepted accounting principles fsp 1423 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 and interim periods within those fiscal years we are currently evaluating the impact if any that the adoption of fsp 1423 in our fiscal 2010 will have on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows 

fair value measurements 

in september 2006 the fasb issued statement no 157 fair value measurements sfas 157 this statement defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements this statement applies to accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements accordingly this statement does not require any new fair value measurements this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years however in january 2008 the fasb issued fasb staff position fas 1572 effective date of fasb statement no 157 fsp 1572 fsp 1572 permits entities to elect to defer the effective date of sfas 157 for one year for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis we have elected to defer the adoption of sfas 157 with respect to those assets and liabilities permitted by fsp 1572 we do not believe the adoption of sfas 157 and fsp 1572 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 

in february 2007 the fasb issued statement no 159 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 115 sfas 159 this statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions this statement is expected to expand the use of fair value measurement which is consistent with the fasb’s longterm measurement objectives for accounting for financial instruments the fair value option established by this statement permits all entities to choose to measure eligible items at fair value at specified 

  

election dates a business entity must report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 and interim periods within those years with early adoption permitted we do not currently plan on utilizing the fair value option as outlined in sfas 159 and we do not believe the adoption of sfas 159 in our fiscal 2009 will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend we face exposure to financial market risks including adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 

foreign currency exchange risk 

our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to western european countries and japan we enter into various hedging transactions to manage this risk we do not enter into or hold foreign currency derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

our nonus revenues generally are transacted through our nonus subsidiaries and typically are denominated in their local currency in addition our nonus expenses that are incurred by our nonus subsidiaries typically are denominated in their local currency approximately 66 61 and 57 of our total revenue was from sales to customers outside of north america in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively approximately 52 46 and 42 of our total expenses were incurred by our subsidiaries domiciled outside of north america in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively 

our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations arises in part from intercompany transactions with most intercompany transactions occurring between a us dollar functional currency entity and a foreign currency denominated entity intercompany transactions typically are denominated in the local currency of the nonus subsidiary in order to centralize foreign currency risk also both ptc the parent company and our nonus subsidiaries may transact business with our customers and vendors in a currency other than their functional currency transaction risk in addition we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results and balances of our nonus subsidiaries are translated into us dollars translation risk if sales to customers outside of the united states increase our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could increase 

our foreign currency risk management strategy is principally designed to mitigate the future potential financial impact of changes in the value of transactions and balances denominated in foreign currency resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates our foreign currency hedging program uses forward contracts to manage the foreign currency exposures that exist as part of our ongoing business operations the contracts primarily are denominated in european currencies and japanese yen and have maturities of less than three months 

generally we do not designate foreign currency forward contracts as hedges for accounting purposes and changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized immediately in earnings because we enter into forward contracts only as an economic hedge any gain or loss on the underlying foreigndenominated balance would be offset by the loss or gain on the forward contract gains and losses on forward contracts and foreign denominated receivables and payables are included in other expense net as of september 30 2008 we had outstanding forward contracts with notional amounts equivalent to 1547 million 617 million between the euro and us dollar 345 million in british pounds 250 million between the british pound and the euro and 95 million between the british pound and the us dollar 199 million between the indian rupee and the 

  

us dollar 123 million between the chinese renminbi and the us dollar 101 million between the japanese yen and the us dollar and 163 million in other currencies as of september 30 2007 we had 910 million 405 million in euros 311 million in british pounds 71 million in japanese yen 16 million in korean won and 107 million in other currencies 

we periodically use foreign currency option contracts to hedge specific forecasted net cash flow transactions that are derived from anticipated nonus revenue foreign currency option contracts are designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes and changes in the fair value of the option contract are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings when the underlying forecasted transaction impacts earnings as of september 30 2008 and 2007 there were no foreign currency option contracts outstanding 

debt 

as of september 30 2008 the amount outstanding under our variablerate revolving credit facility was 629 million euros which was equivalent to 885 million on that date the current loan matures on november 28 2008 and accrues interest at 57175 per annum upon the due date and subsequent due dates we may either repay the amount outstanding or roll over the amount outstanding with new short term loans at the then current interest rates under the credit facility this eurodenominated loan is subject to foreign currency rate risk additionally the entire amount is subject to interest rate risk as interest rates will be adjusted at the respective due date to the extent such amounts are not repaid the impact would be partially mitigated by the floating rate interest earned on excess cash if there was a hypothetical 10 change in interest rates the annual net impact to earnings and cash flows would be approximately 05 million this hypothetical change in cash flows and earnings has been calculated based on the borrowings outstanding at september 30 2008 and the current interest rate of 57175 per annum applied over a oneyear period 

cash and cash equivalents 

as of september 30 2008 cash equivalents were invested in highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased we invest our cash with highly rated financial institutions in north america europe and asiapacific and in diversified domestic and international money market mutual funds at september 30 2008 we had cash and cash equivalents of 502 million in the united states 1340 million in europe 405 million in japan and 322 million in other nonus countries principally in asiapacific given the short maturities and investment grade quality of the portfolio holdings at september 30 2008 a hypothetical 10 change in interest rates would not materially affect the fair value of our cash and cash equivalents 

our invested cash is subject to interest rate fluctuations and for nonus operations foreign currency risk in a declining interest rate environment we would experience a decrease in interest income the opposite holds true in a rising interest rate environment over the past several years the us federal reserve board european central bank and bank of england have changed certain benchmark interest rates which have led to declines and increases in market interest rates these changes in market interest rates have resulted in fluctuations in interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents interest income will continue to fluctuate based on changes in market interest rates and levels of cash available for investment our consolidated cash balances were impacted unfavorably in 2008 and favorably in 2007 and 2006 by the weakening and strengthening respectively of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar particularly with respect to the euro and the japanese yen

as required by sec rule 13a15b we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of management including our principal executive and principal financial officers of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this annual report based on this evaluation we concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of september 30 2008 

management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f of the exchange act as a process designed by or under the supervision of our principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by our board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that 

 

  

  

 because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of september 30 2008 using the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal controlintegrated framework  management excluded cocreate from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of september 30 2008 because it was acquired by us in a purchase business combination during the first quarter of 2008 cocreate’s total assets and total revenues represented less than 3 and 7 respectively of our related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended september 30 2008 

  

based on this assessment and those criteria our management concluded that as of september 30 2008 our internal control over financial reporting was effective 

the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of september 30 2008 has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which appears under item 8 

remediation of prior period material weakness 

as previously disclosed in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended september 30 2007 we concluded that as of september 30 2007 we did not maintain effective control procedures over the accounting for income taxes including the determination and reporting of accrued income taxes deferred taxes and the related income tax provision specifically that we did not have adequate personnel to enable us to properly consider and apply generally accepted accounting principles for taxes review and monitor the accuracy and completeness of the components of the income tax provision calculations and the related deferred taxes and accrued income taxes ensure that the rationale for certain tax positions was appropriate and ensure that effective oversight of the work performed by our outside tax advisors was exercised 

we implemented the following changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2008 that contributed to the remediation of the material weakness described above 

 

  

  

 change in internal control over financial reporting 

the changes we made to remedy the prior period material weakness described above were the only changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the last fiscal quarter that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

overview 

 

parametric technology corporation ptc develops markets and supports product lifecycle management plm software solutions and related services that help companies improve their processes for developing physical and information products our software solutions help customers decrease time to market improve product quality increase innovation and reduce product development cost 

 

the plm market encompasses the mechanical computeraided design manufacturing and engineering cad cam and cae market and the collaboration and product data management pdm solutions market as well as many previously isolated markets that address various phases of a product’s lifecycle these include 

 

  

our software solutions include 

 

  

these software solutions enable companies to 

 

  

our plm solutions suite addresses significant challenges that companies and in particular manufacturing companies face in their product and documentation development processes these include 

 

 1 

 

  

our plm software solutions suite provides our customers with a product development system that permits individuals—regardless of their roles in the commercialization of a product the computerbased tools they use or their location geographically or in the supply chain—to participate in the product development process we have devoted significant resources to developing our enterprise solutions and integrating them with our design software we continue to integrate our products more tightly and make them easier to deploy we believe this will create significant added value for our customers 

 

an extension of our plm solutions our publishing solutions enable our customers to address significant inefficiencies in crossfunctional or complex documentation development processes today most companies use traditional desktop publishing tools that involve a significant amount of manual work to maintain accurate documentation this causes considerable additional work where multiple authors contribute to the development of content content changes frequently multiple organizations within a company have specialized requirements but use similar content or regulatory compliance requires standardization across all information outputs our publishing solutions allow customers to create compound documents from reusable content components manage the content and processes to enable teams to work together and configure and publish the information for a variety of uses and audiences in multiple formats 

 

our solutions are complemented by our experienced services and technical support organizations as well as resellers and other strategic partners our services and technical support organizations provide training consulting implementation and support services to customers worldwide our resellers supplement our direct sales force to provide greater geographic and small account coverage primarily for our desktop solutions our strategic partners provide complementary product andor service offerings 

 

acquisitions 

 

a key element of our growth strategy is to acquire businesses that complement our product development system 

 

we have completed a number of strategic acquisitions over the past year additionally we recently announced that we have entered into an agreement to purchase all of the outstanding shares of cocreate software gmbh a provider of plm and cad modeling solutions for approximately 250 million net of cash acquired and excluding transaction fees cocreate is a privately held company based in sindelfingen germany with revenue of approximately 75 million over the last twelve months and 280 employees completion of the acquisition is subject to customary conditions the acquisition of cocreate is expected to close during the first quarter of 2008 below is a summary of the strategic transactions we have completed in the past year 

 

 

 

in the first quarter of 2008 ptc acquired logistics business systems lbs a provider of integrated logistics support solutions for the aerospace and defense and civil aviation industries for approximately 16 million in cash lbs was a privately held company based in preston uk with approximately 5 million in annual revenue and approximately 45 employees this acquisition strengthens ptc’s publishing solutions because lbs solutions for provisioning training and elearning and logistics support analysis help customers deliver product support information that is compliant with industry standards s1000d s2000m and scorm the combination of ptc and lbs will facilitate the reuse of both product design and configuration data such as cad files bills of material change management information and logistics information 

 

our acquisition of nc graphics enables us to provide a more comprehensive suite of computeraided manufacturing solutions for design and machining of molds dies prototypes and other highspeed precision machining applications we now market and sell the nc graphics technology as protoolmaker tm  offered either standalone or as an optional module of our proengineer ® software nc graphics had approximately 15 employees primarily in the uk and approximately 3 million in annual revenue 

 

our acquisition of itedo software gmbh and itedo software llc together itedo enables us to provide software solutions for creating and maintaining technical illustrations to customers in multiple manufacturing markets such as automotive aerospace and defense and industrial equipment the itedo solutions are now an integral part of our product development system and branded as part of the arbortext ® product family they help us complete our solution for creating managing and publishing text and graphical content for technical publications itedo had approximately 30 employees primarily in germany and generated revenue of approximately 5 million for the twelve months ended july 31 2006

geographic and segment information 

 

financial information about our international and domestic operations including by segment and principal products may be found in note n of “notes to consolidated financial statements” which information is incorporated herein by reference 

product development 

 

to remain competitive we must provide our customers with new and innovative software solutions accordingly we continue to invest in research and development and we look for opportunities to acquire new technologies suited to our customers’ needs we must also efficiently manage our development resources to ensure the appropriate balance among product lines based on both product development plans and customer demand 

 

the modular structure of our software code helps us to rapidly develop new design products this structure enables functional capabilities of existing products to be used in new software applications or modules thereby reducing the amount of new code required to develop additional products much of our enterprise solutions technology is internetcentric javabased objectoriented software and our products depend on these evolving technologies we also license certain technologies from third parties to augment the functionality of our products we generally pay these third parties either periodic royalties or fixed fees for the use of their technologies and rely on them for development and other support we continually review the associated costs development resource savings support levels and if applicable experience with the third party to determine whether the use of such technologies is beneficial 

 

over the past few years we have focused much of our research and development on integrating our products into a unified product development system this strategy is supported by changes we have made to both our product planning and product testing processes to ensure that the products work together in a cohesive system across specific customer business processes 

 

we also work closely with our customers to define improvements and enhancements to our products customers become involved early in the software design process to help validate feasibility and to provide feedback on functionality in addition we maintain software and hardware partner programs designed to provide partners with access to our products and with the mechanisms and environment to facilitate the integration of complementary products with our product lines by using our software development toolkits partners can build tightly integrated solutions that satisfy the various requirements of our customers 

 

our research and development expenses were 1624 million in 2007 1470 million in 2006 and 1183 million in 2005 additional information about our research and development expenditures may be found in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—results of operations—costs and expenses—research and development” 

 

sales and marketing 

 

we derive most of our revenue from products and services distributed directly by our sales force to our enduser customers we also offer products through thirdparty distributors our direct sales force focuses on large accounts while our reseller channel provides a costeffective means of covering the small and mediumsize business market 

 

within our direct sales force we have both strategic accounts and general business accounts units the strategic accounts unit is further divided into vertical groups such as aerospace and defense automotive consumer products electronics and high technology industrial products and life sciences this vertical orientation is mirrored in our services delivery organization and increasingly in the products we deliver to strategic accounts the general business account unit is organized geographically in addition we continue to broaden our indirect distribution channel through alliances with thirdparty resellers and other strategic partners who provide products andor services that complement our offerings our resellers distribute our desktop solutions including proengineer and provide related services throughout north america europe and parts of asiapacific our other strategic partners complement our product development system with ancillary offerings we also authorize select resellers to distribute our windchill solutions to the small and mediumsize business market 

 

competition 

 

we compete primarily in the plm market including the cadcamcae market we compete with a number of companies that offer solutions that address specific functional areas covered by our solutions including dassault systemes sa and siemens ag as a result of its acquisition of ugs corp in 2007 for traditional desktop solutions pdm solutions manufacturing planning solutions and visualization and digital mockup solutions and oracle corporation as a result of its acquisition of agile software corporation in 2007 for pdm solutions in addition we compete with sap ag which has entered the plm market and offers a solution that controls product data within the larger framework of its enterprise resource planning solution we believe our plm solutions are more specifically targeted toward the product development processes within manufacturing companies and offer broader and deeper functionality in those processes 

 

we compete with design products such as autodesk inc’s inventor siemens ag’s solid edge and dassault systemes’ solidworks for sales to smaller manufacturing customers we also compete with emc documentum ibm’s filenet opentext adobe framemaker and the microsoft office suite

backlog 

 

we generally ship our products within 30 days after acceptance of a customer order a high percentage of our license revenue historically has been generated in the third month of each fiscal quarter and this revenue tends to be concentrated in the later part of that month accordingly orders may exist at the end of a quarter that have not been shipped and not been recognized as revenue we do not believe that our backlog at any particular point in time is indicative of future sales levels 

 

employees 

 

as of september 30 2007 we had 4449 employees including 1166 in sales and marketing 1271 in customer support training and consulting 465 in general and administration and 1547 in product development of these employees 1859 were located in the united states and 2590 were located outside the united states

 item 1a risk factors tableend  

the following are important factors we have identified that could affect our future results you should consider them carefully when evaluating forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report and otherwise made by us or on our behalf because these factors could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in forwardlooking statements the risks described below are not the only risks we face additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business financial condition andor operating results 

  

our operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter making our revenue and operating results difficult to predict 

 

our quarterly operating results have historically fluctuated and are likely to continue to fluctuate depending on a number of factors including the following 

 

  

accordingly our quarterly results are difficult to predict prior to the end of the quarter and we may be unable to confirm or adjust expectations with respect to our operating results for a particular quarter until that quarter has closed any failure to meet our quarterly revenue or earnings targets could adversely impact the market price of our stock 

 

we may be adversely affected by a decline in demand for plm solutions 

 

we currently derive our license and service revenues predominantly from our integrated plm software products and services and we expect this to continue into the future as a result factors affecting the demand for plm software solutions or pricing pressures on this single category could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

 

we depend on sales within the manufacturing market 

 

a large amount of our revenues are related to sales to customers in the manufacturing sector a decline in general economic or business conditions or a decline in spending in this sector could cause customers to reduce or defer spending on information technology improvements which would cause our revenue and earnings to decrease or to grow more slowly furthermore declines in license sales may adversely affect the size of our installed base and our level of service revenue 

 

because a substantial portion of our sales are to existing customers and sales to new customers often rely on customer references our business could be adversely affected if those customers were to become dissatisfied with our products andor services 

 

many of our sales are followon sales to existing customers who invest in our product development system if a significant number of customers were to become dissatisfied with our products or services or otherwise elected to adopt either competing solutions or a competitive product development system we could lose those followon sales which would adversely affect our revenues in addition we could lose an important source of references which could adversely impact our ability to obtain new customers finally a decrease in the size of our installed base could adversely affect both our license revenues and our service revenues 

 

our cost structure is relatively fixed in the short term which makes it difficult to reduce our expenses quickly in response to declines in revenue or revenue growth 

 

we make expenditures to support our revenue growth in advance of achieving the expected revenue our expenses associated with headcount and facilities can be difficult to reduce quickly due to the nature of those items if revenue does not grow at the rate we expect or if it declines our expenses may constitute a larger percentage of our operating budget than we planned which would adversely affect our profitability 

we are relocating some of our business functions to new locations which could adversely affect our operations 

 

as part of our effort to reduce our operating costs and to increase our presence in strategic regions we are relocating some of our business functions to new locations including china transitioning those functions to those locations involves terminating employees in the location from which the business function is moved which will cause us to incur restructuring costs and may cause disruption in those business functions as new personnel are hired and trained additionally because we do not have significant operating experience in some of these countries it may take us longer to realize the benefits we expect from relocating those functions if at all 

 

we use third parties in addition to our direct sales force for the distribution and implementation of our software solutions which makes it more difficult to manage customer relationships 

 

we have entered into relationships with groups of geographically dispersed resellers and other strategic partners to promote sell andor implement our products which can reduce our control over the sales process and the delivery of services to our customers our ability to distribute and implement our software solutions through third parties will depend on 

 

  

our financial condition could be adversely affected if significant errors or defects are found in our software 

 

sophisticated software often contains errors defects or other performance problems when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released as these enhanced versions contain additional programming code and third party sourced functionality that must work across our large product suite if errors or defects are discovered in our current or future products we may not be able to correct them in a timely manner or provide an adequate response to our customers we may therefore need to expend significant financial technical and management resources or divert some of our development resources in order to resolve or work around those defects 

 

errors defects or other performance problems in our products may also result in the loss of or delay in the market acceptance of our products or postponement of product releases or customer deployments such difficulties could also cause us to lose customers technical problems or the loss of customers could also damage our business reputation and cause us to lose new business opportunities 

 

we may be unable to successfully acquire and integrate additional strategic businesses and any additional businesses we acquire may not achieve the revenue and earnings we anticipated 

 

the success of our longterm strategic plan depends in part on our ability to acquire strategic businesses andor technologies if we are unable to identify and complete such acquisitions we may not achieve our revenue or earnings targets if the businesses andor technologies we acquire do not generate the revenue and earnings we expect or if we are unable to effectively integrate the acquired technology into our products we may not achieve our revenue or earnings targets 

 

in addition business combinations involve a number of factors that affect operations and operating results including 

 

 8 

 

  

as a result we may fail to successfully integrate and manage businesses and technologies that we may acquire without incurring substantial expenses delays or other problems that could negatively impact our results of operations if our shortterm liquidity declines or we are forced to divert attention from other initiatives due to resource constraints in connection with acquisitionrelated activity our ability to implement other strategic initiatives or make investments in our operational infrastructure could be impaired 

 

we are dependent on key personnel whose loss could impair our product development or our sales efforts 

 

our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical managerial and sales personnel 

 

our product development efforts are directly affected by the abilities of our technical personnel competition for such highly skilled technical personnel in our industry is intense this competition is even greater in offshore regions where we have shifted certain research and development resources and where concerted efforts to solicit our employees are not uncommon if we are unable to attract and retain technical personnel with the requisite skills our product development efforts could be delayed which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

 

our sales efforts rely on having a sufficient number of sales representatives with the skills and knowledge necessary to sell our products including an ability to educate our customers about our products in order to create and meet demand for our products if we are unable to attract or retain sales personnel with the requisite expertise our sales and revenue could be adversely affected 

 

we must continually modify and enhance our products to keep pace with changing technology and address our customers’ needs and any failure to do so could reduce demand for our products 

 

we must continually modify and enhance our products to keep pace with changes in computer software hardware and database technology and emerging internet standards and to meet evolving customer requirements our ability to remain competitive will depend on our ability to 

 

  

  

  

also as is common in the computer software industry we may from time to time experience delays in our product development efforts any such delays could cause us to incorrectly predict the fiscal quarter in which we will realize revenue from the licensing and shipment of the new or enhanced products and give our competitors a greater opportunity to market competing products 

 

we depend on sales from outside the united states that could be adversely affected by changes in international markets 

 

a significant portion of our business comes from outside the united states accordingly our performance could be adversely affected by economic downturns in europe or the asiapacific region other risks associated with international business include 

 

 9 

 

at times we provide extended payment terms to our customers which may be a factor in our customers’ purchasing decisions and could adversely affect our revenues if we ceased making these terms available 

 

we have provided extended payment terms to certain customers in connection with transactions we have completed with them providing extended payment terms may positively influence our customers’ purchasing decisions but may hurt our cash flows in the shortterm if we reduce the amount of extended payment terms we provide to customers customers might reduce or defer the amount they spend on our products and services from the amount they might otherwise have spent if extended payment terms were available to them if this were to occur our revenue or revenue growth could be lower than in prior periods or than we expect 

 

we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights 

 

our software products and our trademarks including our company names product names and logos are proprietary we protect our intellectual property rights in these items by relying on copyrights trademarks patents and common law safeguards including trade secret protection as well as restrictions on disclosures and transferability contained in our agreements with other parties despite these measures the laws of all relevant jurisdictions may not afford adequate protection to our products and other intellectual property in addition we frequently encounter attempts by individuals and companies to pirate our software solutions if our measures to protect our intellectual property rights fail others may be able to use those rights which could reduce our competitiveness and harm our business 

 

intellectual property infringement claims could be asserted against us which could be expensive to defend and could result in limitations on our use of the claimed intellectual property 

 

the software industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding copyright patent and other intellectual property rights while we have not had any significant claims of this type asserted against us such claims could be asserted against us in the future if a lawsuit of this type is filed it could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel we cannot be sure that we would prevail against any such asserted claims if we did not prevail we could be prevented from using that intellectual property or required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements which might not be available on terms acceptable to us in addition to possible claims with respect to our proprietary information some of our products contain technology developed by and licensed from third parties and we may likewise be susceptible to infringement claims with respect to these thirdparty technologies 

 

  

competition is increasing which may reduce our profits and limit or reduce our market share 

 

the market for our plm software solutions is rapidly changing and increasingly competitive we expect competition to intensify which could result in price reductions for our products and services reduced gross margins and loss of market share our primary competition comes from 

 

  

in addition analysts expect future consolidation within the software industry which could give rise to new competitors to compete effectively in this evolving industry we must 

 

  

increasing competition in the computeraided design marketplace may reduce our revenues 

 

a large portion of our revenues are currently derived from our computeraided design solutions and there are an increasing number of competitive design products some of which emphasize lower price points and ease of use compared to the more robust functionality of our solutions this increased competition makes attracting new customers more difficult in addition some competitive products have reached a level of functionality whereby product differentiation is less likely in and of itself to dislodge incumbent design systems given the training data conversion and other startup costs associated with system replacement although proengineer wildfire which focuses on plm interoperability and ease of use is designed to address these competitive 

pressures increased competition and further market acceptance of competitive products could have a negative effect on pricing and revenue for our products which could have a material adverse affect on our results 

 

in addition even though our design software is capable of performing on a variety of platforms as compared to several of our competitors whose products focus on single platform applications particularly windowsbased platforms we may be unable to create a competitive advantage by offering multiple platform applications 

 

growth in the computeraided design solutions industry has slowed 

 

growth in certain segments of the computeraided design solutions industry has slowed and coupled with decreased functional differentiation among flexible engineering tools may adversely affect our ability to penetrate the market for new customers and capture market share over the long term we believe our emphasis on plm solutions will allow us to differentiate our cadcamcae solutions from the competition and to increase sales of our enterprise solutions however the strategy may not be successful or may take longer than we expect our operating results could be materially adversely affected if these assumptions are incorrect 

 

our assumptions about the product lifecycle management plm market opportunity may be wrong 

 

we have identified plm as a market opportunity for us and have devoted significant resources toward capitalizing on that opportunity we offer a suite of plm solutions and related services targeted at this market based on our enterprise solutions together with our desktop solutions this suite includes software and services that use internet technologies to enable our customers’ employees suppliers and customers to collaboratively develop build distribute and manage products throughout their entire lifecycle because the market for software products that enable companies to collaborate on product information on an enterprisewide level is emerging we cannot be sure of the size of this market whether it will grow whether companies will elect to use our products or acquire plm solutions from other sources or forego plm initiatives altogether 

 

in addition companies that have already invested substantial resources in other methods of sharing product information in the designthroughmanufacture process may be reluctant to adopt a new approach that may replace limit or compete with their existing systems or methods we expect that we will continue to need to educate prospective customers about the uses and benefits of our products demand for and market acceptance of our products will be affected by the success of those efforts 

 

if we are unable to successfully differentiate our products from those of our competitors we may be unable to preserve or increase our market share 

 

we rely on the integral nature of our offerings as a competitive differentiator some of our competitors have recently announced or taken steps to make their products integrated if our competitors succeed in their efforts or convince customers that they will be successful in their efforts our ability to use the integral nature of our offerings as a competitive differentiator will be diminished which could adversely affect our ability to retain or increase our market share 

 

our solutions must meet customer expectations to be successful 

 

the success of our plm strategy will depend in large part on the ability of our solutions to meet customer expectations especially with respect to 

 

  

our opportunity in the small and mediumsize business market when manufacturers migrate from twodimensional design tools to entrylevel threedimensional design tools depends in large part on our ability to educate consumers on the benefits and ease of use of our products likewise with larger strategic customers we must differentiate our products’ capabilities from those of our competitors including larger companies with established enterprisewide relationships with these customers 

if our solutions fail to meet customer expectations customers may stop their adoption of our solutions resulting in a loss of potential additional sales and we may be unable to attract new customers for our solutions 

 

iii other considerations 

 

we are currently defending a lawsuit seeking substantial damages in which we could be liable 

 

on august 2 2007 ge capital leasing corporation “gecl” filed a lawsuit against us the lawsuit alleges that gecl was fraudulently induced to provide over 60 million in financing on behalf of toshiba corporation for purchases of third party products predominantly ptc products during the period from 2003 to 2006 gecl claims that ptc participated in the alleged scheme or alternatively should have been aware of the scheme and made negligent misrepresentations that enabled the scheme to continue undetected all of the alleged transactions occurred in japan gecl claims damages of 47 million and seeks three times that amount plus attorneys’ fees in connection with our restatement of revenue associated with the toshiba transactions described in note b to our consolidated financial statements approximately 41 million of revenue was deferred and classified as customer advances in our consolidated balance sheets that liability will remain recorded until the rights and obligations of the several companies connected with the toshiba transactions are resolved to the extent that matters are resolved in our favor we will reduce customer advances and record revenue or other income at that time we have not accrued any other liability for this matter as of september 30 2007 

 

we dispute gecl’s claims and intend to defend this action vigorously if gecl were to prevail in the litigation we could be liable for damages to gecl which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

 

we have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting that until remediated could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements 

 

in connection with the audit of our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended september 30 2007 we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting because we failed to maintain effective controls over the accounting for income taxes we are in the process of addressing and remediating this material weakness but this process will take some time accordingly until we remediate this weakness this weakness could result in a misstatement of our taxrelated accounts that would result in a material misstatement to our interim or annual consolidated financial statements if we are unable to effectively remediate this material weakness and to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective in any future period we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which could have an adverse effect on our stock price and potentially subject us to litigation in addition we will incur costs and expenses including the hiring of additional personnel and the retention of professional advisors in connection with remediating this material weakness 

 

we have a revolving credit facility and have borrowed funds under that facility 

 

we recently announced that we have entered into an agreement to purchase all of the outstanding shares of cocreate software gmbh a provider of plm and cad modeling solutions for approximately 250 million net of cash acquired and excluding transaction fees in connection with this acquisition we borrowed approximately 220 million under our revolving credit facility in addition we may undertake additional borrowings against the credit facility in the future to support our operations including additional strategic acquisitions for any such borrowing we will incur periodic payment obligations in addition we are required to comply with the required financial and operating covenants which could limit our ability to operate our business as we otherwise might operate it our failure to comply with any of these covenants or to meet our payment obligations could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived would result in all amounts outstanding including all accrued interest and unpaid fees becoming immediately due and payable we may not have sufficient working capital or liquidity to satisfy our repayment obligations in the event of an acceleration of those obligations in addition if we are not in compliance with the financial and operating covenants at the time we wish to borrow funds we will be unable to borrow funds or to borrow additional funds 

 

our stock price has been volatile which may make it harder to resell your shares at a time and at a price that is favorable to you 

 

market prices for securities of software companies are generally volatile and are subject to significant fluctuations unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies the trading prices and valuations of these stocks and of ours may not be predictable negative changes in the public’s perception of the prospects of software companies or of ptc or the plm market generally could depress our stock price regardless of our results 

 

also traditionally a large percentage of our common stock has been held by institutional investors purchases and sales of our common stock by these institutional investors could have a significant impact on the market price of the stock for more 

information about those investors please see our proxy statement with respect to our most recent annual meeting of stockholders and schedules 13d and 13g filed with the sec with respect to our common stock

forwardlooking statements 

 

statements in this annual report about anticipated financial results and growth as well as about the development of our products and markets are forwardlooking statements that are based on our current plans and assumptions important information about the bases for these plans and assumptions and factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements is contained below and in item 1a“risk factors” of this report 

 

unless otherwise indicated all references to a year reflect our fiscal year that ends on september 30 

 

restatement of previously issued financial results 

 

as a result of an independent investigation led by the audit committee of our board of directors the audit committee concluded on october 29 2007 that we would need to restate our previously issued financial statements for the effect of certain transactions involving toshiba corporation of japan “toshiba” for which we recorded revenue of approximately 41 million during fiscal 2001 through 2006 based on its investigation the audit committee concluded that the understanding of the arrangement was not fully reflected in the order paperwork for these transactions because there were additional circumstances known or knowable by one or more of our personnel in japan that condition required us to change our conclusion that the transactions met the revenue recognition criteria of statement of position 972 software revenue recognition  

 

the results of the investigation indicate that during the period 2001 to 2006 an employee of toshiba corporation initiated purchases of both software and services from our subsidiary in japan ptc japan kk “ptc japan” many of these purchases were completed through a third party trading company that procured the software and services on toshiba’s behalf the transactions were supported by orders that were signed by employees of toshiba and the third party trading company ptc japan delivered the items for which revenue was recorded and was paid for the orders in question the toshiba employee also allegedly entered into a series of financing agreements with third party leasing companies including ge capital leasing corporation of japan “gecl” in the name of toshiba to fund various purchases as part of those transactions the leasing companies allegedly entered into transactions with various third party trading companies to procure the purchased items on behalf of toshiba we were not a party to those financing agreements toshiba has disclaimed responsibility for repayment of these financed amounts and has alleged that the toshiba employee who entered into the financing agreements was not authorized to do so and that toshiba did not receive delivery of the items so financed 

 

recently the toshiba employee involved in the transactions was arrested and charged with defrauding certain of the leasing companies among the allegations against him are that he forged contracts in the name of toshiba in addition three individuals—each employed by a different trading company involved in the transactions—have been arrested for alleged involvement in a scheme to defraud the leasing companies according to published news reports the toshiba employee and these other individuals are suspected of diverting some of the proceeds of the financings to a bank account controlled by one or more of them following these arrests it was reported on october 23 2007 that two former employees of ptc japan were arrested on suspicion of demanding “hush money” from one of the participants in the fraudulent scheme the press accounts indicate that the former ptc japan employees—who left employment with ptc japan in 2003 and 2004 respectively—were no longer working at ptc japan at the time of the alleged demands according to the press accounts these individuals have not been charged with participating in the alleged underlying fraud 

 

to effect the restatement of revenue associated with the transactions placed by the toshiba employee we reduced previously recorded revenue by approximately 8 million in fiscal 2006 15 million in fiscal 2005 9 million in fiscal 2004 2 million in fiscal 2003 and 7 million in prior years and recorded related income tax effects we did not make any adjustments to the costs incurred in connection with these transactions due to the uncertainty regarding our ultimate ability to retain the advances received for these transactions and our belief that all such costs are unrecoverable upon restatement the revenue reversed from those prior periods was deferred and classified as customer advances in our consolidated balance sheets that liability which totaled 403 million and 395 million at september 30 2007 and 2006 respectively after the effects of foreign currency movements will remain recorded until the rights and obligations of the several companies connected with the toshiba transactions are resolved to the extent that matters are resolved in our favor we will reduce customer advances and record revenue or other income at that time 

 

our restatement of prior period financial statements also includes adjustments for other previously identified errors that we had corrected in the periods they became known to us rather than in the periods in which they originated because we believed that the amounts of such errors individually and in the aggregate were not material to our financial statements for the affected periods in this restatement we have now recorded those corrections in the periods in which each error originated such adjustments which have been tax effected primarily relate to i recording rent expense on a straightline basis for one of our office facilities 

ii recording stockbased compensation expense due to the timing of approvals for certain stock options we granted iii deferring or reversing revenue for certain customer orders in the asiapacific region and iv reversing an income tax reserve that was unwarranted when established our restatement also includes an adjustment to correct our third quarter 2007 financial statements for a 104 million overstatement of reported net income which resulted from tax errors detected in the fourth quarter of 2007 relating primarily to our release in the third quarter of a substantial portion of the valuation allowance for our us net deferred tax assets 

 

a summary of the cumulative revenue and net income effects of the restatement on our consolidated financial statements is as follows 

 

 

 

the restatement had no effect on previously reported cash balances or on the amounts of net cash flows from operating investing and financing activities the adjustments made as a result of the restatement are more fully described in note b to our consolidated financial statements included in “financial statements and supplementary data” in item 8 for a discussion of our consideration of the accounting errors which resulted in the restatement and our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting see “controls and procedures” included in part ii item 9a of this form 10k 

 

all amounts referenced to september 30 2006 and 2005 in the following discussion reflect the balances and amounts on a restated basis also comparisons of 2006 and 2005 to any other years have been revised from those included in our annual report on form 10k for 2006 as necessary to reflect the restated information 

 

executive overview 

 

during the past few years ptc has focused on both revenue growth and profitability improvements to increase shareholder value in 2007 we achieved 11 revenue growth over 2006 and our operating income improved from 665 million to 928 million net income for 2007 was 1437 million or 122 per diluted share compared to 568 million or 050 per diluted share in 2006 in 2007 we reversed our valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in the us and other jurisdictions and as a result we recorded a onetime tax benefit of 589 million even if the impact of this valuation allowance reversal were excluded we improved net income and eps from 2006 to 2007 

 

for 2007 we reported total revenue of 9413 million including total license revenue of 2961 million which was up 12 from 2006 our results reflect continued organic revenue growth and a small contribution from our acquired businesses we delivered increased desktop solutions revenue record enterprise solutions revenue and significant operating leverage 

 

we believe our operating results in 2007 reflect successful execution of our strategic initiatives which focused on improving our product and service offerings our distribution model our strategic account relationships our competitive position and our marketing programs as well as increased technology spending by our customers particularly in europe we believe our strategic initiatives have created three key competitive differentiators our product development system capabilities our single platform architecture and an understanding of our customers’ product development challenges which we believe are causing customers to adopt our solutions in particular we believe our strategy to offer a product development system with fully integrated solutions on a common architecture provides us with a significant competitive advantage and is a major factor in our increased sales of proengineer and windchill 

 

as part of our continuing efforts to increase profitability we are relocating additional business functions to locations including china where operating costs are lower and where we are also seeking to establish a presence as part of this initiative we incurred restructuring costs of 153 million in 2007 all of it in the fourth quarter and expect to incur additional restructuring costs of 

approximately 10 million in 2008 we expect that by moving these business functions to these countries we will increase both our strategic presence and our profitability 

 

also we are continuing to expand our business through acquisitions we recently entered into an agreement to purchase cocreate software gmbh for approximately 250 million net of cash acquired and excluding transaction fees we expect the transaction to close in the first quarter of 2008 in connection with the planned closing of the transaction on november 28 2007 we borrowed approximately 220 million from our revolving credit facility to complete the transaction our acquisition of cocreate is significant in a number of respects first we expect it will increase both revenue and operating margins in 2008 as cocreate had revenue of approximately 75 million and significant operating margins in the past twelve months second it enables us to both offer additional product development solutions and enhance our ability to offer our other product development solutions to cocreate’s historical customers we expect to be able to leverage our strong presence in north america and the pacific rim to sell cocreate’s products to our existing customer base finally because cocreate’s revenues are concentrated in europe and japan we expect to benefit from increased presence in those markets 

 

acquisitions 

 

a significant element of our growth strategy is to acquire strategic companies and technologies that expand our solution footprint andor our distribution model and will also be accretive to our financial results we have made a number of strategic acquisitions that add to and expand elements of our solutions each of our acquisitions has helped us to extend our product development system which we consider to be a significant competitive advantage for us you can find more information about these acquisitions under the subheading “acquisitions” of item 1 “business” of this annual report which begins on page 1 and in note e to the accompanying “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

 

market opportunities 

 

we believe demand for our traditional cadcamcae solutions will continue to grow modestly and that the broader plm market presents an opportunity for greater growth we believe the overall market for plm solutions is evolving as manufacturers seek to improve their total product development processes instead of focusing on individual productivity in engineering or manufacturing these product development processes have become increasingly complex as companies develop and manufacture products across geographic and corporate boundaries a trend we refer to as “global product development” 

 

we also believe there is a growing opportunity in the small and mediumsize business market as manufacturers in this segment migrate from twodimensional design tools to entrylevel threedimensional design tools additionally we believe these smaller manufacturers have a need for and will invest in enterprise solutions over the next several years 

 

fiscal year 2008 strategies and risks 

 

in support of our goal to increase revenue and profitability in 2008 we plan to continue to 

 

  

our success will depend on among other factors our ability to 

 

 18 

 

  

we discuss additional factors affecting our revenue and operating results under item 1a “risk factors ” of this annual report 

 

results of operations 

 

overview 

 

the following is a summary of our results of operations for the last three years which includes the results of operations of companies we acquired beginning on their acquisition date and beginning in the fourth quarter of 2005 includes increased stockbased compensation expense as a result of our adoption of sfas 123r at the beginning of that quarter a detailed discussion of these results follows the table 

 

 

 

 

  

total costs and expenses reflect increases in our operating cost structure from acquisitions measured increases to support planned revenue growth and from 2005 to 2006 the adoption of new stockbased compensation accounting rules refer to costs and expenses beginning on page 24 for a more detailed discussion total costs and expenses reflect the following 

 

  

the provision for benefit from income taxes in 2007 2006 and 2005 is net of tax benefits totaling 628 million 61 million and 121 million respectively the 2007 benefit includes a 589 million tax benefit due to the reversal of a significant portion of our valuation allowances against deferred tax assets in the us and in a foreign jurisdiction and a 39 million tax benefit from the favorable outcome of a tax refund claim in the us the 2006 benefit resulted from favorable resolutions of tax audits with the internal revenue service in the us the 2005 benefit resulted from favorable resolutions of tax audits in a nonus jurisdiction 

 

net income reflects improved operating margin contributions from increased revenue year over year offset by the impact of the items discussed above 

the following table shows certain consolidated financial data as a percentage of our total revenue for the last three years 

 

 

 

revenue 

 

our revenue consists of software license revenue and service revenue which includes software maintenance revenue consisting of providing our customers software updates and technical support and consulting and training revenue including implementation services 

 

we report our revenue in two product categories 

 

  

through the end of the third quarter of 2005 half of prointralink revenue was allocated to desktop solutions and half was allocated to enterprise solutions as a result of the new windchillbased architecture of prointralink beginning as of the fourth quarter of 2005 all prointralink revenue is classified as enterprise solutions 

total revenue 

 

the following table illustrates trends from 2005 to 2007 in our software license and service revenues as well as by product category 

 

 

 

in 2007 and 2006 we had yearoveryear revenue growth in both desktop solutions and enterprise solutions we attribute this growth to execution of our strategic initiatives an increase in the number of new seats sold in both product categories and increased technology spending by our customers particularly in europe and china and in 2006 north america the revenue growth reflects both organic growth of our enterprise solutions and desktop solutions and revenue from acquired businesses including arbortext and mathsoft additionally total revenue in 2007 was benefited by changes in the foreign exchange rate due to the translation of revenue recorded in europe into us dollars prior to our acquisitions of those businesses arbortext generated revenue of approximately 40 million for the twelve months ended june 30 2005 and mathsoft generated revenue of approximately 20 million for the twelve months ended march 31 2006 the arbortext and mathsoft businesses have been included in our results of operations since their acquisition dates arbortext on july 19 2005 and mathsoft on april 28 2006 accordingly 2005 results include arbortext only for the fourth quarter and do not include mathsoft and 2006 results include mathsoft for approximately 5 months since april 29 2006 

 

total revenue from our enterprise solutions software and related services was 38 35 and 30 of our total revenue in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively 

 

the increases in enterprise solutions revenue in 2007 and 2006 compared to the prior year reflect 

 

  

the increase in enterprise solutions revenue in 2006 compared to 2005 also reflects 

 

  

total revenue from our desktop solutions and related services was 62 65 and 70 of our total revenue in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively the increase in desktop solutions revenue in 2007 as compared to 2006 reflects 

 

 21 

 

  

these increases were partially offset by declines in desktop solutions service revenue particularly in north america due to both anticipated and unplanned reductions in revenue from training services and computerbased training products 

 

the increase in desktop solutions revenue in 2006 as compared to 2005 was due primarily to increases in sales of our entrylevel package of proengineer and sales of related modules and package upgrades throughout our customer base as well as to sales of products from our arbortext and mathsoft businesses 

 

license revenue 

 

total 

 

license revenue accounted for 31 of total revenue in 2007 and 2006 and 29 of total revenue in 2005 the growth in license revenue in 2007 compared to 2006 reflects revenue growth from customers of all sizes and across product categories the growth in license revenue in 2006 compared to 2005 was primarily due to organic growth in both enterprise solutions and desktop solutions including contributions from our reseller channel and contributions from our acquired businesses including arbortext mathsoft and itedo from the date of each transaction 

 

enterprise 

 

the increase in enterprise solutions license revenue in 2007 as compared to the 2006 came primarily from sales of windchill pdmlink ®  our core windchill content and process management solution as both existing and new customers adopted our windchill solutions the increase in enterprise solutions license revenue in 2006 as compared to 2005 was primarily attributable to organic growth as well as to sales of our arbortext products the number of new windchill seats sold in both 2007 and 2006 increased as compared to the prior year periods which we believe reflects our success in marketing incremental adoption of our solutions as well as our improved competitive position 

 

desktop solutions 

 

the increase in desktop solutions license revenue in 2007 compared to 2006 was due primarily to revenue contribution from sales of mathcad and arbortext isodraw revenue from sales of proengineer was relatively flat from 2007 to 2006 with increases in new seat revenue offset by declines in upgrades and modules the increase in desktop solutions license revenue in 2006 compared to 2005 was due primarily to organic growth which was primarily attributable to higher sales of our entrylevel package of proengineer and related modules and package upgrades and to revenue contributions from sales of mathcad and arbortext isodraw 

 

maintenance revenue 

 

total 

 

maintenance revenue represented 43 44 and 48 of total revenue in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively growth in our maintenance revenue was due to a higher number of seats under maintenance agreements and reflects continued success in improving customer satisfaction with our solutions product enhancements and technical support 

 

enterprise solutions 

 

increases in our enterprise solutions maintenance revenue in 2007 and 2006 were due primarily to an increase in the number of new users of our enterprise solutions as new customers were added and existing customers expanded their implementations to additional users 

 

desktop solutions 

 

the increase in our desktop solutions maintenance revenue in 2007 and 2006 was due to revenue contributions from our acquired products particularly mathcad a higher number of seats under maintenance agreements and growth of license revenue in prior periods 

consulting and training revenue 

 

total 

 

consulting and training service revenue which has a lower gross profit margin than license and maintenance revenue accounted for 25 of total revenue in 2007 and 2006 and 23 of total revenue in 2005 growth in total consulting and training services revenue is attributable to increased use by our customer base of our consulting and training services including our expanding suite of computerbased training products as well as contributions from acquired businesses as we have increased our service revenue we have focused on improving our consulting and training service profit margins by improving consulting staff utilization and growing revenue from highermargin sources such as computerbased training products 

 

enterprise solutions 

 

increases in our enterprise solutions consulting and training service revenue in 2007 were due to increased customer demand for process and implementation consulting services as a result of increased adoption of our software solutions also during 2007 our enterprise solutions consulting and training revenue included a large customer engagement in europe which contributed to the growth in 2007 as compared to 2006 increases in our enterprise solutions consulting and training service revenue from 2005 to 2006 were due to planned growth in services capacity to address increased customer demand for process and implementation consulting services as well as the addition of arbortext which had a significant services business for its publishing solutions 

 

desktop solutions 

 

the decline in desktop solutions consulting and training service revenue in 2007 from 2006 was primarily due to a decrease in consulting and training revenue in north america the increase in desktop solutions consulting and training service revenue in 2006 compared to 2005 was due to the increase in the number of new seats sold in these years versus the prior years as well as to higher revenue from sales of consulting services and training packages including computerbased training products which help our customers improve user proficiency and engineering productivity 

 

revenue from individual customers 

 

we enter into customer contracts that may result in revenue being recognized over multiple reporting periods accordingly revenue recognized in a current period may be attributable to contracts entered into during the current period or in prior periods license andor consulting and training service revenue of 1 million or more recognized from individual customers in a single quarter during the fiscal year was 1567 million 1380 million and 733 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively while our customers may not continue to spend at these levels in future periods we believe this increase is the result of a shift in customer priorities toward plm solutions relative to other it spending initiatives our improved ability to provide broader solutions to our customers and improvements in our competitive position due to our system architecture and product development process knowledge 

 

revenue by geography 

 

 

 

 

  

we derived 61 57 and 62 of our total revenue from sales to customers outside of north america in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively total revenue growth in north america was primarily due to organic growth and in 2006 contributions from sales of arbortext and mathsoft products sales of which were concentrated in that region the results in 2007 in north america reflect growth in maintenance revenue and relatively flat license revenue offset by declines in consulting and training service revenue we believe the improvements in our 2006 revenue in north america are attributable to implementation of our strategic initiatives 

and improvements in the economy in that region where the manufacturing sector and related technology spending had been weak 

 

revenue in europe in 2007 reflects strong growth in both product categories and a benefit from foreign exchange rate movements in 2007 our enterprise solutions consulting and training revenue included a large customer engagement in europe which contributed to the growth in 2007 as compared to 2006 our european revenue in 2006 reflects improvement in sales and services performance in strategic accounts in that region the increase in european revenue in 2006 compared to 2005 was due primarily to strong performance in enterprise solutions including growth in license consulting and training service and maintenance revenue we also experienced growth in desktop solutions particularly license and consulting and training service revenue 

 

asiapacific revenue in 2007 compared to 2006 reflected an 11 increase in the pacific rim and a 12 increase in japan revenue performance in asiapacific for 2006 compared to 2005 reflected a 30 increase in revenue in the pacific rim subregion offset by a 9 decrease in revenue in the japan subregion we believe that the growth in the pacific rim reflects improved market opportunity and better execution after strategic and organizational changes we made in that region early in 2006 we believe that the decrease in revenue in japan in 2006 was partially attributable to market dynamics and partially attributable to our operational execution problems we made organizational and strategic changes in japan and believe these changes have helped improved our results there additionally japan revenue performance is largely driven by large customer transactions which have fluctuated periodtoperiod we believe the asiapacific region particularly china continues to present an important growth opportunity because global manufacturing companies have continued to invest in that region and the market in that region for both our desktop solutions and enterprise solutions is relatively unsaturated 

 

revenue from our reseller channel 

 

we have been building and diversifying our reseller channel to become less dependent on a small number of resellers and to provide the resources necessary for more effective distribution of our products although we typically receive lower revenue per seat for an indirect sale versus a direct sale we believe that using diverse and geographically dispersed resellers that focus on smaller businesses provides an efficient and cost effective means to reach these customers and allows our direct sales force to focus on larger sales opportunities total sales from our reseller channel which are primarily for our desktop solutions were 1952 million in 2007 21 of total revenue 1715 million 20 of total revenue in 2006 and 1414 million 20 of total revenue in 2005 we attribute the revenue increase from our reseller channel to our efforts to expand our reseller channel to the success of proengineer wildfire among small and mediumsize businesses as proengineer wildfire has become increasingly competitive in this market both relative to our historic offerings as well as to competitive offerings in this market segment and to sales of recently acquired arbortext and mathsoft products in each year we continued to experience growth in our reseller channel revenue in north america and europe and in 2006 we also experienced strong growth in our reseller channel in asiapacific we attribute the improvement in our asiapacific reseller channel performance in 2006 to organizational and infrastructure changes we made in that region in the first half of the year 

 

costs and expenses 

 

over the past several years we have made significant investments to transform our business from providing a single line of technical software with a largely direct distribution model supplemented by a small number of channel partners to providing integrated product development system solutions with an expanded channel and partnerinvolved distribution model as part of this effort we have broadened our product development system through acquisitions and we intend to continue to do so 

 

while we intend to continue to invest in our strategic initiatives to support planned revenue growth and to fund revenuegenerating initiatives we remain focused on achieving our operating margin goals accordingly we are taking steps to improve operating margins in the fourth quarter of 2007 we recorded a restructuring charge of 153 million the restructuring charge included a 132 million charge for severance and related costs associated with 262 employees notified of termination during the quarter and 21 million related to excess facilities the charges for excess facilities were primarily related to gross lease commitments in excess of estimated sublease income for excess facilities we are also evaluating other cost savings opportunities including optimizing the use of our leased facilities worldwide and relocating functions and additional workforce to lowercost geographies we expect that this process will result in additional restructuring costs totaling approximately 10 million in 2008 we expect these planned restructuring initiatives will help us to improve operating margins while continuing to grow the business and increase our strategic presence in emerging geographies 

the following table illustrates trends from 2005 to 2007 in our costs and expenses 

 

 

 

 

  

effective july 3 2005 we adopted sfas 123r sharebased payment  accordingly for the full year of 2007 and 2006 and the three months ended september 30 2005 stockbased compensation was accounted for under sfas 123r which requires the expensing of the fair value of stockbased awards in our consolidated statements of operations while for the nine months ended july 2 2005 stockbased compensation was accounted for under apb no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees  which required only the expensing of the intrinsic value if any of stockbased awards the amounts in the table above include the following amounts for stockbased compensation 

 

 

 

total costs and expenses 

 

2007 compared to 2006 total costs and expenses increased to 8485 million in 2007 compared to 7815 million in 2006 total costs and expenses were adversely impacted by foreign currency exchange rates as costs and expenses incurred in europe were translated into us dollars headcount increased to 4449 at the end of 2007 from 4309 at the end of 2006 our increase in costs and expenses including headcount were primarily due to the following

in the fourth quarter of 2005 we recorded a charge of 07 million for inprocess research and development related to two arbortext projects under development for which technological feasibility had not yet been established at the acquisition date and for which there was no alternative future use the value of the purchased inprocess research and development was determined using the residual income approach which discounts expected future cash flows from projects under development to their net present value the expected cost to complete was approximately 2 million as of the acquisition date these development projects were completed in 2006 as expected 

 

restructuring and other charges credits 

 

in 2007 2006 and 2005 we recorded restructuring and other charges credits of 153 million 59 million and 13 million respectively primarily associated with reductions in workforce and excess facility obligations to reduce our cost structure and to improve profitability during those same periods we made cash payments related to restructuring and other charges including payments relating to restructuring and other charges recorded prior to 2004 of 147 million 152 million and 108 million respectively amounts not yet paid at september 30 2007 relating to restructuring and other charges taken during the current and all prior periods were 233 million and primarily relate to excess facility obligations to be paid out through 2014 of the total amount accrued at september 30 2007 we expect to make cash disbursements within the next twelve months of approximately 14 million for restructuring charges incurred in 2007 and prior periods 

 

in the fourth quarter of 2007 we recorded a restructuring charge of 153 million the restructuring charge included a 132 million charge for severance and related costs associated with 262 employees notified of termination during the quarter and 21 million related to excess facilities the charges for excess facilities were primarily related to gross lease commitments in excess of estimated sublease income for excess facilities we are also evaluating other cost savings opportunities including relocating functions and additional workforce to lowercost locations we expect that this process will result in additional restructuring costs totaling approximately 10 million in 2008 

 

in the third quarter of 2006 we recorded a net restructuring charge of 59 million the net restructuring charge included 74 million of severance and related costs associated with the termination of 91 employees in the third quarter of 2006 partially offset by a credit of 15 million primarily related to a plan to reoccupy a portion of our headquarters facility that was previously vacated and had been included in restructuring costs in prior periods the headquarters space was available for sublease and was being marketed but is being reoccupied due to space requirements related to our acquisition of mathsoft as of september 30 2007 substantially all of our remaining excess headquarters space had been sublet 

 

in the fourth quarter of 2005 we recorded a net credit to restructuring and other charges of 13 million the restructuring credit includes a 30 million credit for changes in our estimated liabilities for facilities that we vacated offset by 17 million of severance and termination costs related to nine employees terminated during the period the 30 million credit was due primarily to reoccupying in the fourth quarter of 2005 a portion of our headquarters facility that was previously vacated and included in restructuring costs in a prior period the space was available for sublease and was being marketed but was reoccupied due to space requirements related to our three acquisitions completed in 2005 and general business growth 

 

interest income 

 

interest income represents earnings on the investment of our available cash balances and totaled 99 million 54 million and 69 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively the increase in 2007 compared to 2006 was related primarily to higher average cash balances and higher interest rates interest income was lower in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily due to lower average cash balances as a result of acquisitions completed in the second half of 2005 and the first nine months of 2006 

 

other expense net 

 

other expense net includes costs of hedging contracts certain realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains or losses charges incurred in connection with financing customer contracts writedowns of investments and foreign exchange gains or losses resulting from the required periodend currency remeasurement of the assets and liabilities of our subsidiaries that use the us dollar as their functional currency a large portion of our revenue and expenses is transacted in foreign currencies to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates we engage in hedging transactions involving the use of foreign currency forward contracts primarily in western european and asian currencies other expense net totaled 30 million 17 million and 14 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively the increase in other expense net in 2007 was due primarily to higher foreign exchange losses and other expense of 07 million recorded in the second quarter of 2007 related to the settlement of a disputed obligation related to a previously divested business unit 

income taxes 

 

our income tax provision has fluctuated significantly in terms of amount and rate in each of the past three years due primarily to the impact of discrete events such as the release of a substantial portion of the us valuation allowance and the settlements of tax audits which created onetime income tax benefits in 2007 our effective tax rate was a benefit of 441 on pretax income of 997 million compared to a provision of 191 in the 2006 on pretax income of 702 million and 68 in 2005 on pretax income of 786 million the net tax benefit recorded in 2007 was principally due to a tax benefit of 589 million recorded upon our decision in the third quarter of 2007 to release a substantial portion of the valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets in the us and a foreign jurisdiction as well as a net tax benefit of 39 million recorded in the third quarter of 2007 from the favorable outcome of a tax refund claim in the us in 2006 our effective tax rate of 191 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate of 35 due primarily to a 61 million benefit recorded upon settlement of prior year tax audits in the us discussed below as well as our use of net operating loss carryforwards nols to offset our 2006 us taxable income which reduced the valuation allowance we had previously recorded against those nols in 2005 our effective tax rate of 68 was lower than the 35 statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a tax benefit of 121 million arising from a reduction of our tax liabilities upon favorable resolution of tax audits in a foreign jurisdiction the benefit of foreign taxes paid at a net effective tax rate lower than that in the us and the benefit from the reversal of 41 million of valuation allowances in certain foreign jurisdictions due to their consistent profitability excluding the effect of these onetime tax benefits our income tax provisions in 2007 2006 and 2005 consisted primarily of taxes owed in relation to the income generated by our foreign subsidiaries as well as withholding taxes that we incurred in the us in connection with certain foreign operations the tax provisions of those periods included only insignificant amounts in relation to the income that we generated in the us due to our utilization of available net operating loss carryforwards that previously had been recorded in our balance sheet with a full valuation allowance 

 

as of the end of the second quarter of 2007 a full valuation allowance was recorded against our net deferred tax assets consisting primarily of net operating loss carryforwards in the us and certain foreign jurisdictions based upon our operating results over recent years and through june 30 2007 as well as an assessment of our expected future results of operations during the third quarter of 2007 we determined that it had become more likely than not that we would realize a substantial portion of our net deferred tax assets in the us and a foreign jurisdiction as a result during the third quarter we released a total of 798 million of our valuation allowances of the 798 million valuation allowance release 589 million was recorded as a onetime income tax benefit 200 million was recorded as a reduction to goodwill recorded upon prior acquisitions and 09 million was recorded as a decrease to accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders’ equity 

 

as of september 30 2007 we have a remaining valuation allowance of 371 million against net deferred tax assets in the us and a remaining valuation allowance of 394 million against net deferred tax assets in certain foreign jurisdictions the valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets in the us consists of 277 million for foreign tax credits and 27 million for capital losses that we have determined are not more likely than not to be realized 66 million for stockbased compensation deductions that will be credited to additional paidin capital only when realized and 01 million for certain state operating loss carryforwards that will likely expire without being utilized the valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets of certain foreign jurisdictions consists primarily of net operating loss carryforwards that will likely expire without being utilized 

 

in the normal course of business ptc and its subsidiaries are examined by various taxing authorities including the internal revenue service irs in the united states we recorded a net tax benefit of 39 million in the third quarter of 2007 from the favorable outcome of a tax refund claim in the us in the third quarter of 2006 we reached final agreement with the irs and made federal income tax payments totaling 95 million for liabilities arising from our income tax returns for fiscal years 2001 and 2002 as a result of this final agreement and the tax payments made being less than the accrued income taxes that we had recorded for those years we recorded an income tax benefit in the third quarter of 2006 of 61 million in 2005 we recorded tax benefits of 121 million arising from the reduction of our tax liabilities upon the favorable resolution of foreign jurisdiction tax audits 

 

our future effective tax rate may be materially impacted by the amount of income taxes associated with our foreign earnings which are taxed at rates different from the us federal statutory rate as well as the timing and extent of the realization of deferred tax assets and changes in the tax law further our tax rate may fluctuate within a fiscal year including from quarter to quarter due to items arising from discrete events including settlements of tax audits and assessments the resolution or identification of tax position uncertainties and acquisitions of other companies 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

we have prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america in preparing our financial statements we make estimates assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our reported revenues results from operations and net income as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet these estimates assumptions and judgments about future events and their effects on our results cannot be determined with certainty and are made based on our historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances these estimates may change as new events occur or additional information is obtained and we may periodically be faced with uncertainties the outcomes of which are not within our control and may not be known for a prolonged period of time 

 

the accounting policies methods and estimates used to prepare our financial statements are described generally in note a of notes to consolidated financial statements  the most important critical accounting judgments and estimates that we made in preparing the financial statements involved 

 

  

a critical accounting policy is one that is both material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires us to make difficult subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate and different estimates that we could have used or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process actual results could differ from those estimates 

 

accounting policies guidelines and interpretations related to our critical accounting policies and estimates are generally subject to numerous sources of authoritative guidance and are often reexamined by accounting standards rule makers and regulators these rule makers andor regulators may promulgate interpretations guidance or regulations that may result in changes to our accounting policies which could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 

 

revenue recognition 

 

while we apply the guidance of statement of position sop no 972 software revenue recognition and statement of position no 989 modification of sop 972 software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions both issued by the american institute of certified public accountants as well as sec staff accounting bulletin 104 revenue recognition we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amounts of software license and services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period our primary judgments involve the following 

 

 30 

 

we derive revenues from three primary sources 1 software licenses 2 maintenance services and 3 consulting and training services revenue by type for 2007 2006 and 2005 was as follows 

 

 

 

for software license arrangements that do not require significant modification or customization of the underlying software we recognize revenue when 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 2 delivery has occurred generally fob shipping point or electronic distribution 3 the fee is fixed or determinable and 4 collection is probable substantially all of our license revenues are recognized in this manner 

 

our software is distributed primarily through our direct sales force in addition we have an indirect distribution channel through alliances with resellers and for our mathsoft products with distributors approximately 21 of our total revenue in 2007 was generated from our indirect distributor channel revenue arrangements with resellers are recognized on a sellthrough basis that is when we receive persuasive evidence that the reseller has sold the products to an enduser customer we do not offer contractual rights of return stock balancing or price protection to our resellers and actual product returns from them have been insignificant to date as a result we do not maintain reserves for reseller product returns and related allowances in contrast revenue arrangements with distributors of our mathsoft products have a contractual right to exchange product and are recognized on a sellin basis that is when we ship the products to the distributor as of september 30 2007 the value of product inventory held by distributors and the accrual that we have recorded for estimated product returns were not material 

 

at the time of each sale transaction we must make an assessment of the collectibility of the amount due from the customer revenue is only recognized at that time if management deems that collection is probable in making this assessment we consider customer creditworthiness and historical payment experience at that same time we assess whether fees are fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties if the fee is not fixed or determinable revenue is recognized only as payments become due from the customer provided that all other revenue recognition criteria are met in assessing whether the fee is fixed or determinable we consider the payment terms of the transaction including transactions with payment terms that extend beyond twelve months and our collection experience in similar transactions without making concessions among other factors our software license arrangements generally do not include customer acceptance provisions however if an arrangement includes an acceptance provision we record revenue only upon the earlier of 1 receipt of written acceptance from the customer or 2 expiration of the acceptance period 

 

our software arrangements often include implementation and consulting services that are sold separately under consulting engagement contracts or as part of the software license arrangement when we determine that such services are not essential to the functionality of the licensed software and qualify as “service transactions” under sop 972 we record revenue separately for the license and service elements of these arrangements generally we consider that a service is not essential to the functionality of the software based on various factors including if the services may be provided by independent third parties experienced in providing such consulting and implementation in coordination with dedicated customer personnel if an arrangement does not qualify for separate accounting of the license and service elements then license revenue is recognized together with the consulting services using either the percentageofcompletion or completedcontract method of contract accounting contract accounting is also applied to any software arrangements that include customerspecific acceptance criteria or where the license payment is tied to the performance of consulting services under the percentageofcompletion method we estimate the stage of completion of contracts with fixed or “not to exceed” fees based on hours or costs incurred to date as compared with estimated total project hours or costs at completion if we do not have a sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion revenue is recognized upon completion of the contract when total cost estimates exceed revenues we accrue for the estimated losses when identified the use of the percentageofcompletion method of accounting requires significant judgment relative to estimating total contract costs including assumptions relative to the length of time to complete the project the nature and complexity of the work to be performed and anticipated changes in salaries and other costs when adjustments in estimated contract costs are determined such revisions may have the effect of adjusting in the current period the earnings applicable to performance in prior periods 

 

we generally use the residual method to recognize revenues from arrangements that include one or more elements to be delivered at a future date when evidence of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists under the residual method the fair value of 

the undelivered elements eg maintenance consulting and training services based on vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements ie software license if evidence of the fair value of one or more of the undelivered services does not exist all revenues are deferred and recognized when delivery of all of those services has occurred or when fair values can be established we determine vsoe of the fair value of services revenues based upon our recent pricing for those services when sold separately vsoe of the fair value of maintenance services may also be determined based on a substantive maintenance renewal clause if any within a customer contract our current pricing practices are influenced primarily by product type purchase volume maintenance term and customer location we review services revenues sold separately and maintenance renewal rates on a periodic basis and update when appropriate our vsoe of fair value for such services to ensure that it reflects our recent pricing experience 

 

valuation of assets and liabilities of business combinations 

 

in accordance with business combination accounting we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and inprocess research and development based on their estimated fair values determining these fair values requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets 

 

our identifiable intangible assets acquired consist of developed technology core technology tradenames customer lists and contracts software support agreements and related relationships and consulting contracts developed technology consists of products that have reached technological feasibility core technology represents a combination of processes inventions and trade secrets related to the design and development of acquired products customer lists and contracts and software support agreements and related relationships represent the underlying relationships and agreements with customers of the acquired company’s installed base we have generally valued intangible assets using a discounted cash flow model critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to 

 

  

in addition we estimate the useful lives of our intangible assets based upon the expected period over which we anticipate generating economic benefits from the related intangible asset 

 

net tangible assets consist of the fair values of tangible assets less the fair values of assumed liabilities and obligations except for deferred revenues and restructuring reserves net tangible assets were generally valued by us at the respective carrying amounts recorded by the acquired company as we believed that their carrying values approximated their fair values at the acquisition date 

 

the values assigned to deferred revenue reflect an amount equivalent to the estimated cost plus an appropriate profit margin to perform the services related to the acquired company’s software support contracts restructuring reserves include the severance costs related to employees of the acquired company planned closure of certain facilities and other costs associated with exiting activities of the acquired company 

 

our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable at that time but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions estimates or actual results 

 

valuation of goodwill and acquired intangible assets 

 

our net goodwill and acquired intangible assets totaled 3251 million and 3271 million as of september 30 2007 and 2006 respectively as described in note n of “notes to consolidated financial statements” we have two reporting units 1 our software products segment and 2 our services segment as of september 30 2007 and 2006 goodwill and acquired intangible assets in the aggregate attributable to our software products segment was 2999 million and 3009 million respectively and attributable to our services segment was 252 million and 262 million respectively 

 

we assess the impairment of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets on at least an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable factors we consider important 

on an overall company basis and reportable segment basis as applicable that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results significant changes in our use of the acquired assets or a significant change in the strategy for our business significant negative industry or economic trends a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period or a reduction of our market capitalization relative to net book value 

 

the goodwill impairment test prescribed by sfas 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires us to identify reporting units and to determine estimates of the fair values of our reporting units as of the date we test for impairment to conduct these tests of goodwill the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value if the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeded its fair value we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value of goodwill and its fair value we estimate the fair values of our reporting units using discounted cash flow valuation models those models require estimates of future revenues profits capital expenditures working capital and discount rates for each reporting unit we estimate these amounts by evaluating historical trends current budgets operating plans and industry data we conduct our annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite lived assets as of the end of the third quarter of each fiscal year we completed our annual impairment review as of the end of the third quarter of 2007 and concluded that no impairment charge was required as of that date 

 

for longlived assets and identifiable intangible assets other than goodwill we reassess the recoverability of the asset based on projected undiscounted future cash flows over the asset’s remaining life if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reportable segment below its carrying value when the carrying value of the asset exceeds its undiscounted cash flows we record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset determined using projected discounted future cash flows of the asset determining the fair value of our reporting units for the purpose of testing the potential impairment of individual assets and goodwill requires significant judgment by management different judgments could yield different results 

 

accounting for income taxes 

 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to calculate our income tax expense based on taxable income by jurisdiction there are many transactions and calculations about which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain as a result our calculations involve estimates by management some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenuesharing costreimbursement and transfer pricing arrangements among related entities and the differing tax treatment of revenue and cost items across various jurisdictions if we were compelled to revise or to account differently for our arrangements that revision could affect our tax liability 

 

the income tax accounting process also involves estimating our actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheets we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized we must establish a valuation allowance as a charge to income tax expense 

 

as of the end of the second quarter of 2007 a full valuation allowance was recorded against our net deferred tax assets consisting primarily of operating loss carryforwards in the us and certain foreign jurisdictions based upon our operating results over recent years and through june 30 2007 as well as an assessment of our expected future results of operations during the third quarter of 2007 we determined that it had become more likely than not that we will realize a substantial portion of our net deferred tax assets in the us and a foreign jurisdiction as a result during the third quarter we released a total of 798 million of our valuation allowances of the 798 million valuation allowance release 589 million was recorded as a onetime income tax benefit 200 million was recorded as a reduction to goodwill recorded upon prior acquisitions and 09 million was recorded as a decrease to accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders’ equity 

 

as of september 30 2007 we have a remaining valuation allowance of 765 million against net deferred tax assets the valuation allowance includes 371 million in the us against net deferred tax assets consisting primarily of foreign tax credits the valuation allowance also includes 394 million recorded against net deferred tax assets in certain foreign jurisdictions consisting primarily of net operating loss carryforwards that will likely expire without being utilized 

 

net deferred tax assets at september 30 2007 were 973 million comprised of deferred tax assets of 2108 million partially offset by deferred tax liabilities of 369 million and a valuation allowance of 765 million 

 

accounting for pensions 

 

we sponsor a frozen pension plan covering mostly inactive participants in the united states we make several assumptions that are used in calculating the expense and liability of the plans these key assumptions include the expected longterm rate of return 

on plan assets and the discount rate in selecting the expected longterm rate of return on assets we consider the average future rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits under the pension plan this includes considering the plan’s asset allocations and the expected returns likely to be earned over the life of this plan the discount rate reflects the estimated rate at which an amount that is invested in a portfolio of highquality debt instruments would provide the future cash flows necessary to pay benefits when they come due in addition our actuarial consultants determine the expense and liabilities of the plan using other assumptions for future experience such as mortality rates the actuarial assumptions used by us may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions or longer or shorter life spans of the participants our actual results could differ materially from those we estimated which could require us to record a greater amount of pension expense in future years in determining our pension cost for 2007 2006 and 2005 we used a discount rate of 575 55 and 60 respectively and an expected return on plan assets of 75 for each year 

 

certain of our foreign subsidiaries also sponsor pension plans accounting and reporting for these plans requires the use of countryspecific assumptions for discount rates and expected rates of return on assets we apply a consistent methodology in determining the key assumptions that in addition to future experience assumptions such as mortality rates are used by our actuaries to determine our liability and expense for each of these plans in determining our pension cost for 2007 2006 and 2005 we used weighted average discount rates of 47 46 and 52 respectively and a weighted average expected return on plan assets of 38 39 and 43 respectively 

 

the most sensitive assumptions used in calculating the expense and liability of our pension plans are the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets a 50 basis point change to our discount rate and expected return on plan assets assumptions would not have changed our pension expense for the year ended september 30 2007 by more than 12 million a 50 basis point decrease in our discount rate assumptions would increase our accumulated and projected benefit obligation as of september 30 2007 by approximately 13 million 

 

accounting for stockbased compensation 

 

we adopted sfas 123r on july 3 2005 effective with the beginning of our fourth quarter of 2005 sfas 123r requires us to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grantdate fair value of the award using an option pricing model that cost is recognized as an expense over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 

 

in connection with our adoption of sfas 123r we altered our equity incentive program to use restricted shares and restricted stock units as our principal equity incentive awards our grants of shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units have either timebased vesting requirements or performancebased vesting requirements some of which are then subject to subsequent timebased restrictions if the performancebased targets are achieved in determining the amount of expense to be recorded for restricted shares and restricted stock units judgment is required by us to estimate forfeitures of the awards and to assess the probability of achievement of performancebased award targets if actual forfeitures or actual performancebased target achievement differs from our estimates our results of operations could be impacted 

 

allowance for accounts and other receivables 

 

management judgment is required in assessing the collectibility of customer accounts and other receivables for which we generally do not require collateral we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments in determining the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts management specifically analyzes individual accounts receivable historical bad debts customer concentrations customer creditworthiness current economic conditions accounts receivable aging trends and changes in our customer payment terms our customer base consists of large numbers of geographically diverse customers dispersed across many industries and no individual customer comprised more than 10 of our net accounts receivable for any period presented the following table summarizes our accounts receivable and related reserve balances at september 30 2007 and 2006 

 

 

if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate additional allowances might be required resulting in future operating expenses that are not included in the allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for bad debts as a percentage of gross accounts receivable can vary depending on the level and timing of quarterly revenue as well as the timing of the resolution of specifically reserved doubtful accounts receivable either via collection or writeoff 

 

restructuring charges 

 

we periodically record restructuring charges resulting from restructuring our operations including consolidations andor relocations of operations changes to our strategic plan or managerial responses to declines in demand increasing costs or other environmental factors the determination of restructuring charges requires management judgment and may include costs related to employee benefits such as costs of severance and termination benefits and estimates of costs for future lease commitments on excess facilities net of estimated future sublease income in determining the amount of the facilities charge we are required to estimate such factors as future vacancy rates the time required to sublet properties and sublease rates these estimates are reviewed quarterly based on known real estate market conditions and the creditworthiness of subtenants and may result in revisions to established facility reserves we had accrued 169 million as of september 30 2007 related to excess facilities compared to 207 million at september 30 2006 representing gross lease commitments with agreements expiring at various dates through 2014 of approximately 373 million net of committed and estimated sublease income of approximately 201 million and a present value factor of 03 million we have entered into signed sublease arrangements for approximately 179 million with the remaining 22 million based on future estimated sublease arrangements if our sublease assumptions prove to be inaccurate we may need to make changes in these estimates that would affect our results of operations and potentially our financial condition 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

 

 

we invest our cash with highly rated financial institutions and in diversified domestic and international money market mutual funds the portfolio is invested in shortterm instruments to ensure cash is available to meet requirements as needed 

 

cash and cash equivalents 

 

at september 30 2007 cash and cash equivalents totaled 2633 million compared to 1834 million at september 30 2006 and 2044 million at september 30 2005 the increase in cash and cash equivalents in 2007 is due primarily to 1274 million of cash provided by operations and 91 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock net of cash paid for withholding taxes in connection with settlement of restricted stock units partially offset by 311 million paid for acquisitions primarily itedo and nc graphics 241 million for additions to property and equipment and 100 million used to repurchase common stock the decrease in cash and cash equivalents in 2006 was due primarily to acquisitions of businesses which used cash of 751 million and additions to property and equipment of 195 million partially offset by 653 million of cash provided by operations and 78 million provided by net proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock plans 

cash provided by operating activities 

 

2007 compared to 2006 

 

cash provided by operating activities was 1274 million in 2007 compared to 653 million in 2006 the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to 

 

  

days sales outstanding dso was 74 days as of september 30 2007 compared to 67 days as of september 30 2006 dso at the end of 2007 was adversely affected by the timing of revenue recorded and the impact of extended payment term deals we offered to customers during 2007 and 2006 we offer these terms to some customers with established payment and credit histories 

 

we provided extended payment terms on internally financed transactions accounting for approximately 26 million and 51 million of revenue in 2007 and 2006 respectively other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets include noncurrent receivables from customers related to extended payment term contracts totaling 253 million and 311 million at september 30 2007 and 2006 respectively 

 

2006 compared to 2005 

 

cash provided by operating activities was 653 million in 2006 compared to 1302 million in 2005 cash provided by operating activities was lower primarily due to 

 

  

despite the increase in customer accounts receivable days sales outstanding were 67 days at september 30 2006 compared to 68 days at september 30 2005 

 

our operating cash flow in 2006 was adversely impacted by the increase in the amount of extended payment terms we offered to customers during the year the amount of financing increased due to an increase in large deals in 2006 for which we provided financing particularly in the fourth quarter we provided extended payment terms on transactions accounting for approximately 51 million of revenue in 2006 which was approximately twice the amount of similar transactions in 2005 

 

cash used by investing activities 

 

cash used by investing activities was 551 million in 2007 946 million in 2006 and 2150 million in 2005 in 2007 2006 and 2005 we had cash expenditures of 271 million 751 million and 1989 million respectively for business acquisitions net of cash acquired in 2007 we paid net of cash acquired 67 million for nc graphics 166 million for itedo 23 million for substantially all of the assets of netregulus and 15 million related to the acquisition of the cadtrain assets in 2006 we paid 644 million for mathsoft 99 million for the denc and cadtrain acquisitions and 08 million related to the arbortext acquisition in 2005 we acquired arbortext for 1917 million net of cash acquired further during the third quarter of 2007 we acquired the remaining equity interest in a controlled subsidiary for 40 million cash used for additions to property equipment and intangible assets was 241 million 195 million and 161 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively our expenditures for property and equipment consist primarily of computer equipment software office equipment and facility improvements 

 

cash used provided by financing activities 

 

cash used provided by financing activities was 10 million in 2007 64 million in 2006 and 40 million in 2005 the increase in cash used by financing activities in 2007 was due primarily to the repurchase of 557000 shares of common stock for approximately 100 million the increase in cash provided by financing activities in 2006 compared to 2005 was primarily due to payments of 127 million in 2005 related to our stock option exchange described below cash proceeds from the issuance of our common stock under our stock plans were 156 million 78 million and 102 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively during 2007 2006 and 2005 we used 65 million 01 million and 23 million respectively to pay employee withholding taxes related to restricted stock units that vested during the period in lieu of issuing shares to employees with respect to those 

awards cash provided by financing activities in 2006 was net of 09 million of costs incurred to obtain our revolving credit facility described below 

 

share repurchase authorization 

 

in september 1998 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 80 million shares of our common stock and in july 2000 increased the shares authorized for repurchase to 160 million we had repurchased 125 million shares through the end of 2004 and did not repurchase any additional shares until the third quarter of 2007 when our board of directors authorized us to resume repurchases within established parameters those parameters permit us to use up to 40 million of cash from operations to repurchase our shares through may 15 2008 in 2007 we repurchased 557000 shares at a cost of 100 million since 1998 and through september 30 2007 we repurchased at a cost of 3768 million a total of 130 million shares of the 160 million shares authorized we periodically consider repurchasing additional shares if we were to repurchase additional shares it would reduce our cash balances 

 

stock option exchange 

 

in 2005 we completed a shareholderapproved stock option exchange employees elected to exchange approximately 73 million stock options for an aggregate of 127 million in cash payments which were made in 2005 of this amount 05 million was recorded as compensation expense and 122 million was recorded as a charge to additional paidin capital in stockholders’ equity in accordance with the provisions of sfas 123r 

 

credit facility 

 

on february 21 2006 we entered into a multicurrency bank revolving credit facility the credit facility consists of a 230 million revolving credit facility which may be increased up to an additional 150 million if the existing or additional lenders are willing to make increased commitments the credit facility expires on february 20 2011 when all amounts will be due and payable in full 

 

on november 28 2007 in connection with the planned closing of our acquisition of cocreate we borrowed approximately 220 million under the credit facility we borrowed this amount in two parts first a 36 million tranche at an interest rate of 58125 per year the accrued interest on which is due on february 28 2008 and at which time the rate will be reset if the principal amount is not repaid second a 184 million tranche at an interest rate of 54375 per year the accrued interest on which is due on may 28 2008 and at which time the rate will be reset if the principal amount is not repaid the principal amounts borrowed are not due until february 10 2011 

 

interest rates under the credit facility range from 075 to 150 above the eurodollar rate for eurodollarbased borrowings or are at the defined base rate for base rate borrowings in each case based upon our leverage ratio in addition we may borrow certain foreign currencies at the london interbankoffered interest rates for those currencies with the same range above such rates based on our leverage ratio a quarterly commitment fee based on the undrawn portion of the credit facility is required to be paid by us ranging from 0125 to 030 per year depending upon our leverage ratio 

 

the credit facility limits our and our subsidiaries’ ability to among other things incur additional indebtedness incur liens or guarantee obligations pay dividends and make other distributions make investments and enter into joint ventures dispose of assets and engage in transactions with affiliates except on an armslength basis under the credit facility we and our material domestic subsidiaries may not invest cash or property in or loan cash to our foreign subsidiaries in aggregate amounts exceeding 25 million for any purpose except in connection with acquisitions of businesses in which case the limit includes an additional 50 million these limitations have been waived to permit the cocreate acquisition in addition under the credit facility we and our subsidiaries must maintain specified leverage and fixedcharge ratios any failure to comply with the financial or operating covenants of the credit facility would not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds but would constitute a default resulting in among other things the amounts outstanding including all accrued interest and unpaid fees becoming immediately due and payable we were in compliance with all financial and operating covenants of the credit facility as of september 30 2007 

 

expectations for fiscal 2008 

 

we believe that existing cash and cash equivalents together with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements through at least the next twelve months 

 

during 2008 we expect to make cash disbursements estimated at 14 million for restructuring charges incurred in 2007 and prior periods capital expenditures for 2008 are currently anticipated to be approximately 25 million 

although we expect positive operating cash flow in 2008 we expect our cash balance to decrease at the end of the first quarter primarily due to our acquisition of lbs for approximately 16 million which was completed in the first quarter of 2008 and our proposed acquisition of cocreate for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 250 million net of cash acquired and excluding transaction fees which we expect to close in the first quarter of 2008 subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions we borrowed approximately 220 million under our revolving credit facility on november 28 2007 to finance this acquisition with the balance funded from our existing cash 

 

we have evaluated and expect to continue to evaluate possible strategic transactions on an ongoing basis and at any given time may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to possible strategic transactions our cash position could be reduced and we may incur debt obligations to the extent we complete any significant transactions 

 

contractual obligations 

 

we lease office facilities and certain equipment under operating leases that expire at various dates through 2014 including an operating lease agreement related to our headquarters office in needham massachusetts entered into in 2000 which expires in december 2012 subject to certain renewal rights these leases qualify for operating lease accounting treatment and as such are not included on our balance sheet at september 30 2007 our contractual obligations including future minimum lease payments net of sublease income under noncancellable operating leases are as follows 

 

 

 

 

  

as of september 30 2007 we had letters of credit and bank guarantees outstanding of approximately 47 million of which 14 million was collateralized primarily related to the lease of our headquarters in needham massachusetts 

 

in november 2007 we borrowed 220 million under our revolving credit facility to finance our acquisition of cocreate 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

we have not created and are not party to any specialpurpose or offbalance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital incurring debt or operating parts of our business that are not consolidated to the extent of our ownership interest therein into our financial statements we have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby we have subordinated retained interests derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks contingent liabilities or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing liquidity market risk or credit risk support to us 

new accounting pronouncements 

 

in accordance with recently issued accounting pronouncements we will be required to comply with certain changes in accounting rules and regulations 

 

accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 

 

in july 2006 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes—an interpretation of fasb statement no 109 fin 48 fin 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with sfas 109 accounting for income taxes fin 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return fin 48 also provides guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods and disclosure relative to uncertain tax positions fin 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 with early adoption encouraged we will adopt fin 48 at the beginning of fiscal 2008 we are currently evaluating whether or not the adoption of fin 48 will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

fair value measurements 

 

in september 2006 the fasb issued statement no 157 fair value measurements sfas 157 this statement defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements this statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements the fasb having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute accordingly this statement does not require any new fair value measurements this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years we do not believe the adoption of sfas 157 in fiscal 2009 will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 

 

in february 2007 the fasb issued statement no 159 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 115 sfas 159 this statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions this statement is expected to expand the use of fair value measurement which is consistent with the fasb’s longterm measurement objectives for accounting for financial instruments the fair value option established by this statement permits all entities to choose to measure eligible items at fair value at specified election dates a business entity must report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 and interim periods within those years with early adoption permitted we do not believe the adoption of sfas 159 in fiscal 2009 will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

we face exposure to financial market risks including adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 

 

foreign currency exchange risk 

 

our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to western european countries and japan we enter into various hedging transactions to manage this risk we do not enter into or hold foreign currency derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

 

our nonus revenues generally are transacted through our nonus subsidiaries and typically are denominated in their local currency in addition our nonus expenses that are incurred by our nonus subsidiaries typically are denominated in their local currency approximately 61 57 and 62 of our total revenue was from sales to customers outside of north america in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively approximately 46 42 and 45 of our total expenses were incurred by our subsidiaries domiciled outside of north america in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively 

our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations arises in part from intercompany transactions with most intercompany transactions occurring between a us dollar functional currency entity and a foreign currency denominated entity intercompany transactions typically are denominated in the local currency of the nonus subsidiary in order to centralize foreign currency risk also both ptc the parent company and our nonus subsidiaries may transact business with our customers and vendors in a currency other than their functional currency transaction risk in addition we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results and balances of our nonus subsidiaries are translated into us dollars translation risk if sales to customers outside of the united states increase our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates could increase 

 

our foreign currency risk management strategy is principally designed to mitigate the future potential financial impact of changes in the value of transactions and balances denominated in foreign currency resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates our foreign currency hedging program uses forward contracts to manage the foreign currency exposures that exist as part of our ongoing business operations the contracts primarily are denominated in european currencies and japanese yen and have maturities of less than three months 

 

generally we do not designate foreign currency forward contracts as hedges for accounting purposes and changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized immediately in earnings because we enter into forward contracts only as an economic hedge any gain or loss on the underlying foreigndenominated balance would be offset by the loss or gain on the forward contract gains and losses on forward contracts and foreign denominated receivables and payables are included in other income expense net as of september 30 2007 and 2006 we had outstanding forward contracts with notional amounts equivalent to approximately 910 million 405 million in euros 311 million in british pounds 71 million in japanese yen 16 million in korean won and 107 million in other currencies and 948 million 326 million in euros 278 million in british pounds 207 million in japanese yen 54 million in korean won and 83 million in other currencies respectively 

 

we periodically use foreign currency option contracts to hedge specific forecasted net cash flow transactions that are derived from anticipated nonus revenue foreign currency option contracts are designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes and changes in the fair value of the option contract are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings when the underlying forecasted transaction impacts earnings as of september 30 2007 and 2006 there were no foreign currency option contracts outstanding 

 

cash and cash equivalents 

 

as of september 30 2007 cash equivalents were invested in highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased we invest our cash with highly rated financial institutions in north america europe and asiapacific and in diversified domestic and international money market mutual funds at september 30 2007 we had cash and cash equivalents of 939 million in the united states 990 million in europe 505 million in japan and 199 million in other nonus countries principally in asiapacific given the short maturities and investment grade quality of the portfolio holdings at september 30 2007 a hypothetical 10 change in interest rates would not materially affect the fair value of our cash and cash equivalents 

 

our invested cash is subject to interest rate fluctuations and for nonus operations foreign currency risk in a declining interest rate environment we would experience a decrease in interest income the opposite holds true in a rising interest rate environment over the past several years the us federal reserve board european central bank and bank of england have changed certain benchmark interest rates which have led to declines and increases in market interest rates these changes in market interest rates have resulted in fluctuations in interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents interest income will continue to fluctuate based on changes in market interest rates and levels of cash available for investment our consolidated cash balances were impacted favorably in 2007 and 2006 and unfavorably in 2005 by the strengthening and weakening respectively of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar particularly with respect to the euro and the japanese yen

 item 9a controls and procedures tableend  

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

 

our management maintains disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in its reports filed or submitted under the exchange act is processed recorded summarized and reported 

within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer our principal executive officer and principal financial officer respectively as appropriate to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

 

as required by sec rule 13a15b we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of management including our principal executive and principal financial officers of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this annual report based on this evaluation we concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of september 30 2007 at the reasonable assurance level because of the material weakness noted in our accounting for income taxes described in management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting 

 

notwithstanding the existence of the material weakness described below we concluded that the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k fairly present in all material respects our financial position results of operations and cash flows for the interim and annual periods presented 

 

management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting 

 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f of the exchange act as a process designed by or under the supervision of our principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by our board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that 

 

  

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

 

our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of september 30 2007 using the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control—integrated framework  

 

a material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 

 

as of september 30 2007 we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting because we did not maintain effective controls over the accounting for income taxes including the determination and reporting of accrued income taxes deferred taxes and the related income tax provision specifically we did not have adequate personnel to enable us to properly consider and apply generally accepted accounting principles for taxes review and monitor the accuracy and completeness of the components of the income tax provision calculations and the related deferred taxes and accrued income taxes ensure that the rationale for certain tax positions was appropriate and ensure that effective oversight of the work performed by our outside tax advisors was exercised this material weakness resulted in the restatement of our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements for the third quarter of 2007 in addition until remediated this material weakness could result in a misstatement in the taxrelated accounts described above that would result in a material misstatement to our interim or annual consolidated financial statements and disclosures that would not be prevented or detected 

 

as a result of the material weakness described above our management has concluded that as of september 30 2007 our internal control over financial reporting was not effective 

 

the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of september 30 2007 has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which appears under item 8 

remediation initiatives 

 

our management is in the process of actively addressing and remediating the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting described above during 2008 we will undertake the following actions to remediate the material weakness identified 

 

  

as part of our 2008 assessment of internal control over financial reporting our management will conduct sufficient testing and evaluation of the controls to be implemented as part of this remediation plan to ascertain that they operate effectively 

 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

 

there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act that occurred during the quarter ended september 30 2007 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

 

impact of the revenue restatement on management’s assessment of internal control over financial reporting 

 

as described in note b to our consolidated financial statements included in “financial statements and supplementary data” in item 8 the audit committee of our board of directors concluded on october 29 2007 that restatement of our previously issued financial statements was required for the effect of certain transactions involving toshiba corporation of japan for which we recorded revenue of approximately 41 million during fiscal 2001 through 2006 in this form 10k for fiscal 2007 we are restating our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures as of september 30 2006 and for years ended september 30 2006 and 2005 

 

in connection with our assessment of internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures as of september 30 2007 we considered the accounting error related to certain transactions involving toshiba that resulted in the restatement and concluded that such accounting error is not indicative of the existence of a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of september 30 2007 the circumstances that gave rise to the accounting error involve arrangements established as early as 2001 and the employees associated with those arrangements have not been employed with us since 2004 in fiscal 2005 and since that time we enhanced our internal control environment in connection with our initial and subsequent compliance with the provisions of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the enhancements to our control environment included providing revenue recognition and ethics training to our employees including employees in the affected region among other items in addition beginning in early fiscal 2007 we implemented additional order confirmation procedures with the customer in question to confirm the arrangement underlying any transactions completed in fiscal 2007 finally our audit committee has conducted an independent investigation to confirm that the error that resulted in the restatement did not impact any transactions other than those included in the restatement

our software solutions include 

  

   

   

these software solutions enable companies to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

our software solutions historically focused on addressing the design engineering needs of manufacturing companies over time we expanded our software solutions to enable customers to leverage engineering content across an extended enterprise and design chain as part of this process we diversified our product portfolio to include our windchill content and process management software and our arbortext dynamic publishing software our product development system for manufacturing companies which is a combination of all of our solutions proengineer ®  windchill ®  arbortext ® and mathcad ®  enables customers to meet a broad set of needs across the product lifecycle additionally the arbortext product family including the recently introduced windchillbased arbortext content manager enables us to offer a dynamic publishing system to address the publishing challenges of companies in additional markets such as the life sciences publishing government and financial services markets 

  

our plm and ecm solutions suite addresses significant challenges that manufacturing companies face in their product and documentation development processes more frequent change heterogeneity of systems regulatory compliance increased communication inside and outside the manufacturing enterprise to support growing globalization and outsourcing of development activities increasingly transparent supply chains and growing services and maintenance strategies with our plm software solutions suite we provide our manufacturing customers with a product development system that permits individuals—regardless of their roles in the commercialization of a product the computerbased tools they use or their location geographically or in the supply chain—to participate in the product development process across the digital product value chain we have devoted significant resources to our enterprise solutions and their integration with our design software and continue to integrate our products more tightly and make them easier to deploy we believe this will create significant added value for our customers 

  

our dynamic publishing system which is comprised of arbortext products and technical illustration capabilities added with our recent acquisition of itedo enables us to address significant inefficiencies in crossfunctional or complex documentation development processes today most companies use traditional desktop publishing tools that involve a significant amount of manual work to maintain accurate documentation this causes considerable additional work in environments where multiple authors contribute to the development of content content changes frequently multiple organizations within a company have specialized requirements but use similar content or regulatory compliance drives the need for standardization across all information outputs with our dynamic publishing system our customers can create compound documents from reusable content components manage the content and processes to enable teams to work together and configure and publish the information for a variety of uses and audiences in a variety of formats 

  

our solutions are complemented by our experienced services and technical support organizations as well as resellers and other strategic partners our services and technical support organizations provide training consulting implementation and support services to customers worldwide our resellers supplement our direct sales force and provide greater geographic and small account coverage primarily for our desktop solutions and our strategic partners provide complementary product andor service offerings 

  

acquisitions 

  

a key element of our growth strategy is to acquire businesses that complement our product development system 

  

we have completed eight strategic acquisitions since the third quarter of 2004 

  

   

we acquired itedo software gmbh and itedo software llc together itedo headquartered in germany on october 18 2006 itedo provides software solutions for creating and maintaining technical illustrations to customers in multiple discrete manufacturing markets such as automotive aerospace and defense and industrial equipment with this acquisition we will offer a complete solution for creating managing and publishing text and graphical content for technical publications itedo had approximately 30 employees primarily in germany and generated revenue of approximately 5 million for the twelve months ended july 31 2006 

  

our acquisition of mathsoft best known for its industryleading mathcad solution enables us to provide software that helps organizations create automate document and reuse engineering calculations in the product development process as well as other mathematicsdriven processes mathcad enables our customers to capture this critical information and when combined in our product development system mathcad worksheets can help determine proengineer designs and windchill can manage the worksheets over the life of the product mathsoft had approximately 120 employees in offices primarily in the us and europe and generated revenue of approximately 20 million for the twelve months ended march 31 2006 

  

our acquisition of denc expanded our consulting delivery capacity in germanspeaking europe our acquisition of cadtrain added to our development and delivery of training products denc and cadtrain generated combined revenue of approximately 8 million for the twelve months ended september 30 2005 

  

our acquisition of arbortext enables us to provide solutions to create manage and dynamically publish information concurrently with the development of related products or services improving time to market and quality as well as reducing cost the acquisition provides us with new opportunities within our existing markets and with increased access to new markets such as life sciences publishing government and financial services arbortext had approximately 250 employees in offices around the world and generated revenue of approximately 40 million for the twelve months ended june 30 2005 

  

our acquisition of polyplan technologies provided us with technology that enables concurrent development of products and related manufacturing process plans we are focusing on providing an easytouse and affordable solution for use by mainstream manufacturing engineers who are not satisfied with the manufacturing process management tools available today we expect to release an integrated solution incorporating the polyplan technology in the third quarter of 2007 

  

our acquisition of aptavis enables us to more fully integrate the aptavis technology consisting of windchillbased plm software used by leading footwear and apparel manufacturers and retailers into our product and service offerings and to further develop the technology to address the requirements of international customers 

  

our acquisition of ohio design automation enables us to offer the intercomm ™ suite of electronic design collaboration solutions to enable enterprisewide visualization verification annotation and automated comparison of electronic design content these solutions are targeted toward high tech and electronics manufacturers and other manufacturers of products that contain electronic components we offer the intercomm products both as standalone solutions and as part of the windchill product line 

  

our acquisitions of polyplan aptavis and ohio design are important because they provide increased access to new markets where we can provide different configurations of our product development system but we do not expect these acquisitions to contribute significant incremental revenue in the near term 

  

our principal products and services 

  

our desktop solutions and our enterprise solutions are aligned under a unified product strategy using a common architecture this strategy capitalizes on existing product synergies to offer integral product development solutions 

  

our comprehensive product development system offers our customers the capabilities to improve their product development and documentation processes these processes involve the entire enterprise and extend to supplier partner and customer participants our approach reduces complexity for our customers by ensuring that our solutions work together in a cohesive system our product development system enables our customers to create collaborate control configure and communicate digital product information 

  

across the extended enterprise and design chain these capabilities are enabled by a system architecture that is built to address the needs of the distributed product development environment our product development system architecture is 

  

   

   

   

these same principles apply to our dynamic publishing system allowing us to deliver the benefits of a systembased approach to all of our customers we describe our integral portfolio of desktop solutions and enterprise solutions in more detail below 

  

desktop solutions 

  

our desktop solutions include our integrated cadcamcae software as well as document authoring tools our principal desktop solutions are proengineer mathcad and arbortext editor the family of proengineer cadcamcae software addresses a broad spectrum of engineering disciplines essential to the development of virtually all manufactured products ranging from consumer products to jet aircraft proengineer can improve product quality and reduce time to market by enabling end users to evaluate multiple design alternatives and to share data with bidirectional associativity mathcad helps organizations create automate document and reuse engineering calculations critical to the product development process as well as other mathematicsdriven processes our arbortext document authoring solutions help companies create documents the same way proengineer helps them create product designs by allowing the creation of reusable content as components and as compound documents our approach to document authoring can help companies reduce authoring and translation costs and improve the accuracy and consistency of the information they produce 

  

proengineer is a threedimensional product design solution based on a parametric featurebased solid modeler that enables changes made during the design process to be associatively updated throughout the design proengineer consists of capabilities for detailed design cad manufacturingproduction cam and simulationanalysis cae as well as facilities for exchanging cad data with a multitude of sources and in varied standard formats allowing companies to create more innovative differentiated and functional products quickly and easily

we offer consulting implementation and training services through our services organization as well as through thirdparty resellers and other strategic partners these services enable our customers to adopt and use our solutions more effectively 

  

product development 

  

for our products to remain competitive we must provide our customers with new and innovative software solutions accordingly we continue to invest in research and development and we look for opportunities to acquire new technologies suited to our customers’ needs we must also efficiently manage our development resources to ensure the appropriate balance among product lines based on both product development plans and customer demand 

  

our ability to rapidly develop new design products is facilitated by the modular structure of our software code this structure enables functional capabilities of existing products to be used in new software applications or modules thereby reducing the amount of new code required to develop additional products much of our enterprise solutions technology is internetcentric javabased objectoriented software and our products depend on these evolving technologies we also license certain technologies from third parties to augment the functionality of our products we generally pay these third parties either periodic royalties or fixed fees for the use of their technologies and rely on them for development and other support we continually review the associated costs development resource savings support levels and if applicable experience with the third party to determine whether the use of such technologies is beneficial 

  

over the past few years we have focused much of our research and development investment on integrating our products into a unified product development system this strategy is supported by changes we have made to both our product planning and product testing processes these planning and testing phase changes ensure that the products work together in a cohesive system across specific customer business processes 

  

we also work closely with our customers to define improvements and enhancements to our products customers become involved in the software design process to help validate feasibility and to provide feedback on functionality early in the development of our products in addition we maintain software and hardware partner programs designed to provide partners both with access to our products and with the mechanisms and environment to facilitate the integration of complementary products with our product lines by using our software development toolkits program members can build tightly integrated solutions that satisfy the various requirements of our customers 

  

our fiscal year research and development expenses were 1473 million in 2006 1183 million in 2005 and 1080 million in 2004 additional information about our research and development expenditures may be found in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—results of operations—costs and expenses—research and development” 

  

sales and marketing 

  

we derive most of our revenue from products and services distributed directly by our sales force to our enduser customers we also offer products through thirdparty distributors our direct sales force focuses on large accounts while our reseller channel provides a costeffective means of covering the small and mediumsize business market 

  

within our direct sales force we have both strategic accounts and general business accounts units the strategic accounts unit is further divided into vertical groups such as aerospace and defense automotive consumer products electronics and high technology industrial products and life sciences this vertical orientation is mirrored in our services delivery organization and increasingly in the products we deliver to strategic accounts the general business account unit is organized geographically in addition we continue to broaden our indirect distribution channel through alliances with thirdparty resellers and other strategic partners who provide products andor services that complement our offerings our resellers distribute our desktop solutions including proengineer and provide related services throughout north america europe and parts of asiapacific our other strategic partners complement our product development system with ancillary offerings we also authorize select resellers to distribute our windchill link solutions and plm on demand to the small and mediumsize business market 

  

financial information about our international and domestic operations including by segment and principal products may be found in note m of “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

  

competition 

  

we compete primarily in the plm market including the cadcamcae market and the ecm market 

  

we compete in the plm market with a number of companies that offer solutions that address specific functional areas covered by our solutions including dassault systemes sa and ugs corp for traditional desktop solutions pdm solutions manufacturing planning solutions and visualization and digital mockup solutions and agile software corporation for pdm solutions in addition we compete with larger betterknown enterprisesolution companies with established customers that have entered the plm market and offer solutions integrated with their other enterprise software applications for example sap ag offers a solution that controls product data within the larger framework of its enterprise resource planning solution we believe our plm solutions are more specifically targeted toward the product development processes within manufacturing companies and offer broader and deeper functionality in those processes

backlog 

  

we generally ship our products within 30 days after acceptance of a customer order a high percentage of our license revenue historically has been generated in the third month of each fiscal quarter and this revenue tends to be concentrated in the later part of that month accordingly orders may exist at the end of a quarter that have not been shipped and not been recognized as revenue we do not believe that our backlog at any particular point in time is indicative of future sales levels 

  

employees 

  

as of september 30 2006 we had 4309 employees including 1145 in sales and marketing 1307 in customer support training and consulting 420 in general and administration and 1437 in product development of these employees 1936 were located in the united states and 2373 were located outside the united states

 item 1a risk factors tableend   

the following are important factors we have identified that could affect our future results you should consider them carefully when evaluating forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report and otherwise made by us or on our behalf because these factors could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in forwardlooking statements the risks described below are not the only risks we face additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business financial condition andor operating results 

  

i operational considerations 

  

our operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter which may make it difficult to assess the strength of our business 

  

our quarterly operating results have historically fluctuated and are likely to continue to fluctuate depending on a number of factors including the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

in addition the levels of quarterly or annual software or service revenue in general or for particular geographic areas may not be comparable to those achieved in previous periods 

  

we may be adversely affected by a decline in demand for plm solutions 

  

we currently derive our license and service revenues predominantly from our integrated plm software products and services and we expect this to continue into the future as a result factors affecting the demand for plm software solutions or pricing pressures on this single category could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

  

we depend on sales within the discrete manufacturing market 

  

a large amount of our revenues are related to sales to customers in the discrete manufacturing sector a decline in general economic or business conditions or a decline in spending in this sector could cause customers to reduce or defer spending on information technology improvements which would cause our revenue and earnings to decrease or to grow more slowly 

  

because a substantial portion of our sales are to existing customers and sales to new customers often rely on customer references our business could be adversely affected if those customers were to become dissatisfied with our products andor services 

  

many of our sales are followon sales to existing customers who invest in our product development system if a significant number of customers were to become dissatisfied with our products or services or otherwise elected to adopt either competing solutions or a competitive product development system we could lose those followon sales which would adversely affect our revenues in addition we could lose an important source of references which could adversely impact our ability to obtain new customers finally a decrease in the size of our installed base could adversely affect both our license revenues and our service revenues 

  

our cost structure is relatively fixed in the short term which makes it difficult to reduce our expenses quickly in response to declines in revenue or revenue growth 

  

we made expenditures to support our revenue growth in 2006 and anticipate making incremental expenditures to support future planned growth our expenses associated with headcount and facilities can be difficult to reduce quickly due to the nature of those items if revenue does not grow at the rate we expect or if it declines our expenses may constitute a larger percentage of our operating budget than we planned which would adversely affect our profitability 

  

we use third parties in addition to our direct sales force for the distribution and implementation of our software solutions which makes it more difficult to manage customer relationships 

  

we have entered into relationships with groups of geographically dispersed resellers and other strategic partners to promote sell andor implement our products which can reduce our control over the sales process and the delivery of services to our customers our ability to distribute and implement our software solutions through third parties will depend on 

  

   

   

   

   

our financial condition could be adversely affected if significant errors or defects are found in our software 

  

sophisticated software often contains errors defects or other performance problems when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released if errors or defects are discovered in our current or future products we may not be able to correct them 

  

in a timely manner or provide an adequate response to our customers we may therefore need to expend significant financial technical and management resources or divert some of our development resources in order to resolve or work around those defects 

  

errors defects or other performance problems in our products may also result in the loss of or delay in the market acceptance of our products or postponement of product releases or customer deployments such difficulties could also cause us to lose customers technical problems or the loss of customers could also damage our business reputation and cause us to lose new business opportunities 

  

we may be unable to successfully acquire and integrate strategic businesses and any additional businesses we acquire may not achieve the revenue and earnings we anticipated 

  

the success of our longterm strategic plan depends in part on our ability to acquire strategic businesses andor technologies if we are unable to identify and complete such acquisitions we may not achieve our revenue or earnings targets if the businesses andor technologies we acquire do not generate the revenue and earnings we expect or if we are unable to effectively integrate the acquired technology into our products we may not achieve our revenue or earnings targets 

  

business combinations involve a number of factors that affect operations and operating results including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

as a result we may fail to successfully integrate and manage businesses and technologies that we may acquire without incurring substantial expenses delays or other problems that could negatively impact our results of operations if our shortterm liquidity declines or we are forced to divert attention from other initiatives due to resource constraints in connection with acquisitionrelated activity our ability to implement other strategic initiatives or make investments in our operational infrastructure could be impaired 

  

we are dependent on key personnel whose loss could impair our product development or our sales efforts 

  

our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical managerial and sales personnel 

  

our product development efforts are directly affected by the abilities of our technical personnel competition for such highly skilled technical personnel in our industry is intense this and the competition for such personnel is even greater in offshore regions where we have shifted certain research and development resources and where concerted efforts to solicit employees are not uncommon if we are unable to attract and retain technical personnel with the requisite skills our product development efforts could be delayed which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

  

our sales efforts rely on having a sufficient number of sales representatives with the skills and knowledge necessary to sell our products including an ability to educate our customers about our products in order to create and meet demand for our products if we are unable to attract or retain sales personnel with the requisite expertise our sales and revenue could be adversely affected 

  

we must continually modify and enhance our products to keep pace with changing technology and address our customers’ needs and any failure to do so could reduce demand for our products 

  

we must continually modify and enhance our products to keep pace with changes in computer software hardware and database technology and emerging internet standards and to meet evolving customer requirements our ability to remain competitive will depend on our ability to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

also as is common in the computer software industry we may from time to time experience delays in our product development efforts any such delays could cause us to incorrectly predict the fiscal quarter in which we will realize revenue from the licensing and shipment of the new or enhanced products and give our competitors a greater opportunity to market competing products 

  

we depend on sales from outside the united states that could be adversely affected by changes in international markets 

  

a significant portion of our business comes from outside the united states accordingly our performance could be adversely affected by economic downturns in europe or the asiapacific region another consequence of significant international business is that a large percentage of our revenues and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies that fluctuate in value although we may from time to time enter into foreign exchange forward contracts andor foreign exchange option contracts to offset a portion of the foreign exchange fluctuations significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could have a material impact on our results which are reported in us dollars other risks associated with international business include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

at times we provide extended payment terms to our customers which may be a factor in our customers’ purchasing decisions and could adversely affect our revenues if we ceased making these terms available 

  

we have provided extended payment terms to certain customers in connection with transactions we have completed with them providing extended payment terms may positively influence our customers’ purchasing decisions but may negatively impact our cash flows in the shortterm if in the future we reduce the amount of extended payment terms we provide to customers customers might reduce or defer the amount they spend on our products and services from the amount they might otherwise have spent if extended payment terms were available to them if this were to occur our revenue or revenue growth could be lower than in prior periods or than we expect 

  

we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights 

  

our software products and our trademarks including our company names product names and logos are proprietary we protect our intellectual property rights in these items by relying on copyrights trademarks patents and common law safeguards including 

  

trade secret protection as well as restrictions on disclosures and transferability contained in our agreements with other parties despite these measures the laws of all relevant jurisdictions may not afford adequate protection to our products and other intellectual property in addition we frequently encounter attempts by individuals and companies to pirate our software solutions if our measures to protect our intellectual property rights fail others may be able to use those rights which could reduce our competitiveness and harm our business 

  

intellectual property infringement claims could be asserted against us which could be expensive to defend and could result in limitations on our use of the claimed intellectual property 

  

the software industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding copyright patent and other intellectual property rights while we have not to date had any significant claims of this type asserted against us such claims could be asserted against us in the future if a lawsuit of this type is filed it could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel we cannot be sure that we would prevail against any such asserted claims if we did not prevail we could be prevented from using that intellectual property or required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements which might not be available on terms acceptable to us in addition to possible claims with respect to our proprietary information some of our products contain technology developed by and licensed from third parties and we may likewise be susceptible to infringement claims with respect to these thirdparty technologies 

  

ii product related considerations 

  

competition is increasing which may reduce our profits and limit or reduce our market share 

  

the market for our plm software solutions is highly fragmented rapidly changing and increasingly competitive we expect competition to intensify which could result in price reductions for our products and services reduced gross margins and loss of market share our primary competition comes from 

  

   

   

in addition analysts expect future consolidation within the software industry which could give rise to new competitors to compete effectively in this evolving industry we must 

  

   

   

   

increasing competition in the computeraided design marketplace may reduce our revenues 

  

a large portion of our revenues are currently derived from our computeraided design solutions and there are an increasing number of competitive design products some of which emphasize lower price points and ease of use compared to the more robust functionality of our solutions this increased competition makes attracting new customers more difficult in addition some competitive products have reached a level of functionality whereby product differentiation is less likely in and of itself to dislodge incumbent design systems given the training data conversion and other startup costs associated with system replacement although proengineer wildfire which focuses on plm interoperability and ease of use is designed to address these competitive pressures increased competition and further market acceptance of competitive products could have a negative effect on pricing and revenue for our products which could have a material adverse affect on our results 

  

in addition even though our design software is capable of performing on a variety of platforms as compared to several of our competitors whose products focus on single platform applications particularly windowsbased platforms we may be unable to create a competitive advantage by offering multiple platform applications 

  

  

growth in the computeraided design solutions industry has slowed 

  

growth in certain segments of the computeraided design solutions industry has slowed and coupled with decreased functional differentiation among flexible engineering tools may adversely affect our ability to penetrate the market for new customers and capture market share over the long term we believe our emphasis on plm solutions will allow us to differentiate our cadcamcae solutions from the competition and to increase sales of our enterprise solutions however the strategy may not be successful or may take longer than we expect our operating results could be materially adversely affected if these assumptions are incorrect 

  

our assumptions about the product lifecycle management plm market opportunity may be wrong 

  

we have identified plm as a market opportunity for us and have devoted significant resources toward capitalizing on that opportunity we offer a suite of plm solutions and related services targeted at this market based on our enterprise solutions together with our desktop solutions this suite includes software and services that use internet technologies to enable our customers’ employees suppliers and customers to collaboratively develop build distribute and manage products throughout their entire lifecycle because the market for software products that enable companies to collaborate on product information on an enterprisewide level is emerging we cannot be sure of the size of this market whether it will grow whether companies will elect to use our products or acquire plm solutions from other sources or forego plm initiatives altogether 

  

in addition companies that have already invested substantial resources in other methods of sharing product information in the designthroughmanufacture process may be reluctant to adopt a new approach that may replace limit or compete with their existing systems or methods we expect that we will continue to need to educate prospective customers about the uses and benefits of our products demand for and market acceptance of our products will be affected by the success of those efforts 

  

if we are unable to successfully differentiate our products from those of our competitors we may be unable to preserve or increase our market share 

  

we rely on the integral nature of our offerings as a competitive differentiator some of our competitors have recently announced or taken steps to make their products integrated if our competitors succeed in their efforts or convince customers that they will be successful in their efforts our ability to use the integral nature of our offerings as a competitive difference will be diminished which could adversely affect our ability to retain or increase our market share 

  

our solutions must meet customer expectations to be successful 

  

the success of our plm strategy will depend in large part on the ability of our solutions to meet customer expectations especially with respect to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

our opportunity in the small and mediumsize business market when manufacturers migrate from twodimensional design tools to entrylevel threedimensional design tools depends in large part on our ability to educate consumers on the benefits and ease of use of our products likewise with larger strategic customers we must differentiate our products’ capabilities from those of our competitors including larger companies with established enterprisewide relationships with these customers 

  

if our solutions fail to meet customer expectations customers may stop their adoption of our solutions resulting in a loss of potential additional sales and we may be unable to attract new customers for our solutions 

  

iii other considerations 

  

we have a revolving credit facility and may borrow funds under that facility to support our operations including strategic acquisitions 

  

if we were to borrow funds we would incur periodic payment obligations including interest in addition we are required to comply with the required financial and operating covenants which could limit our ability to operate our business as we otherwise might operate it our failure to comply with any of these covenants or to meet our payment obligations could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived would result in all amounts outstanding including all accrued interest and unpaid fees becoming immediately due and payable we may not have sufficient working capital or liquidity to satisfy our repayment obligations in the event of an acceleration of those obligations in addition if we are not in compliance with the financial and operating covenants at the time we wish to borrow funds we will be unable to borrow funds or to borrow additional funds 

  

our operating results fluctuate within each quarter and from quarter to quarter making our revenues and operating results difficult to predict 

  

while our sales cycle varies substantially from customer to customer a high percentage of our revenue is generated in the third month of each fiscal quarter and this revenue tends to be concentrated in the later part of that month in addition our operating expenses are based on expected future revenue and are largely fixed for the short term as a result a revenue shortfall in any quarter could cause our earnings for that quarter to fall below expectations as well accordingly our quarterly results are difficult to predict prior to the end of the quarter and we may be unable to confirm or adjust expectations with respect to our operating results for a particular quarter until that quarter has closed any failure to meet our quarterly revenue or earnings targets could adversely impact the market price of our stock 

  

our stock price has been highly volatile which may make it harder to resell your shares at a time and at a price that is favorable to you 

  

market prices for securities of software companies are generally volatile in particular the market price of these stocks has been and may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies the trading prices and valuations of these stocks and of ours may not be predictable negative changes in the public’s perception of the prospects of software companies or of ptc or the plm market generally could depress our stock price regardless of our results 

  

also traditionally a large percentage of our common stock has been held by institutional investors purchases and sales of our common stock by these institutional investors could have a significant impact on the market price of the stock for more information about those investors please see our proxy statement with respect to our most recent annual meeting of stockholders and schedules 13d and 13g filed with the sec with respect to our common stock

 item 2 properties 

  

we currently lease 119 offices used in operations in the united states and internationally through our nonus subsidiaries predominately as sales andor support offices and for research and development work of our total of approximately 1197000 square feet of leased facilities used in operations approximately 592000 square feet are located in the us including 329000 square feet of our headquarters facility located in needham massachusetts the lease for our headquarters began in december 2000 and expires in december 2012 subject to certain renewal rights we also lease space comprising approximately 397000 square feet which is not used for our current operations and is primarily subleased to third parties as described in notes b and g of “notes to consolidated financial statements” lease commitments on unused facilities in excess of expected sublease income have been included in our restructuring provisions we continue to engage in subleasing and early lease termination initiatives to employ alternate uses for these excess facilities we believe that our facilities are adequate for our present needs 

  




 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

on may 30 2003 a lawsuit was filed against us in the us district court for the district of massachusetts by rand a technology corporation and rand technologies limited together “rand” rand historically had been our largest distributor the complaint alleged various breaches of a revised oneyear distribution agreement entered into in december 2002 as well as other agreements between rand and us and also asserted certain noncontract claims we filed certain counterclaims against rand in the course of the proceeding rand initially quantified its claimed damages as being in excess of 50 million but as a result of certain court rulings more recently quantified its damages at 12 million rand further asserted that its damages should be trebled ptc disputed rand’s claims ptc also filed a second action against rand in 2005 alleging misuse of our intellectual property and rand asserted certain counterclaims in that action in december 2006 the parties reached an agreement to settle their disputes as a result of this agreement to settle we recorded a charge of 23 million in general and administrative expense in our 2006 consolidated statements of operations 

  

we also are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business we currently believe that resolving these other matters will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations

executive overview 

  

in 2004 we focused on and achieved a significant turnaround in profitability in 2005 we focused on increasing revenue and profitability and achieved yearoveryear revenue growth of 9 and improved our profitability in 2006 we continued to focus on increasing revenue and profitability and achieved 19 yearoveryear revenue growth our operating income for 2006 was 717 

  

million compared to 858 million in 2005 and net income for 2006 was 609 million or 054 per diluted share compared to 836 million or 075 per diluted share in 2005 we adopted sfas no 123r sharebased payment  sfas 123r in the fourth quarter of 2005 and therefore our operating results for 2005 do not include the cost of stockbased compensation for the first nine months excluding the impact of adopting sfas 123r our profitability in 2006 would have been higher than in 2005 and was higher than we had planned 

  

in 2006 we reported total revenue of 8549 million up 19 from 2005 including total license revenue of 2635 million up 26 from 2005 our results reflect continued acceleration in organic revenue growth and contribution from our acquired businesses we delivered increased desktop solutions revenue record enterprise solutions revenue and significant operating leverage 

  

we believe our operating results in 2006 reflect successful execution of our strategic initiatives which focused on improving our product and service offerings our distribution model our strategic account relationships our competitive position and our marketing programs and increased technology spending by our customers particularly in north america we believe our strategic initiatives have created three key competitive differentiators our product development system capabilities our single platform architecture and an understanding of our customers’ product development challenges which we believe are causing customers to adopt our solutions in particular we believe our strategy to offer a product development system with fully integrated solutions on a common architecture provides us with a significant competitive advantage and is a major factor in our increased sales of proengineer and windchill 

  

our operating expenses increased in 2006 primarily due to our adoption of sfas 123r in the fourth quarter of 2005 and the acquisitions we have completed in the past two years our operating expenses in 2006 reflected 405 million of stockbased compensation expense including 23 million resulting from our completed review of historical stock option grants compared to 155 million of such expense in 2005 as well as 140 million of amortization of acquired intangible assets and inprocess research and development charges compared to aggregate charges of 49 million for those items in 2005 our operating expenses also increased in 2006 and 2005 due to additional expenditures we made to support our revenue growth and the addition of operating expenses from our strategic acquisitions 

  

acquisitions 

  

a significant element of our growth strategy is to acquire strategic technologies that expand our solution our acquisitions of arbortext mathsoft and most recently itedo are good examples of this strategy our acquisition of arbortext enabled us to offer technical publications solutions that facilitate timely accurate and productspecific technical publications likewise mathsoft enabled us to offer the mathcad engineering calculation software solution as part of our product suite in addition these acquisitions also provide us entry into vertical markets we previously have not served including the life sciences publishing government and financial services markets itedo a provider of software solutions for creating and maintaining technical illustrations acquired in the first quarter of 2007 will enable us to offer a 2d technical illustration solution as part of our technical publications solution 

  

the arbortext and mathsoft businesses contributed to our planned growth in 2006 and we expect them to contribute to our growth in the future particularly now that our product integrations of these solutions are largely complete 

  

in addition to our acquisitions of arbortext mathsoft and itedo we have made a number of other strategic acquisitions since the third quarter of 2004 that add to and expand elements of our solutions each of our acquisitions has helped us to extend our product development system which we consider to be a significant competitive advantage for us you can find more information about these acquisitions under the subheading “acquisitions” of item 1 “business” section of this annual report which begins on page 2 

  

stock option grant review 

  

in the fourth quarter of 2006 we announced that we had commenced a review of our historic stock option grant practices under the supervision of our audit committee we completed our review in november 2006 our review did not identify any stock option grants that involved the intentional selection of an earlier effective date in order to grant options with a more favorable exercise price our review did identify some stock option grants for which the financial accounting measurement dates differed from the 

  

stated grant dates these errors related primarily to fiscal 2002 and prior periods were not material to our reported results for prior and current periods and did not require restatement of those results to correct the priorperiod errors identified we recorded a stockbased compensation charge of 23 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 this charge was included in the stockbased compensation amounts for 2006 

  

market opportunities 

  

we believe demand for our traditional cadcamcae solutions will continue to grow modestly and that the broader plm market continues to present an opportunity for greater growth we believe the overall market for plm solutions is evolving as manufacturers seek to improve their total product development processes instead of focusing on individual productivity in engineering or manufacturing these product development processes have become increasingly complex as companies develop and manufacture products across geographic and corporate boundaries a trend referred to as “global product development” 

  

we also believe there is a growing opportunity in the small and mediumsize business market as these manufacturers migrate from twodimensional design tools to entrylevel threedimensional design tools we believe these smaller manufacturers have a need for and will invest in enterprise solutions over the next several years 

  

finally we entered the ecm market as the result of our acquisition of arbortext in the fourth quarter of 2005 we believe potential for significant growth exists in the portion of the ecm market that arbortext addressed as a standalone solution we also believe we have an incremental opportunity to sell our windchillbased content management solutions into vertical markets beyond our core manufacturing base as a result of the recent combination of windchillbased arbortext content manager arbortext editor and arbortext publishing engine into an endtoend dynamic publishing solution 

  

fiscal year 2007 strategies and risks 

  

in support of our goal to increase revenue and earnings in 2007 we plan to continue to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

our success will depend on among other factors our ability to 

  

   

   

   

   

  

   

we discuss additional factors affecting our revenue and operating results under item 1a “risk factors ” of this annual report 

  

results of operations 

  

overview 

  

the following is a summary of our results of operations for the last three years which includes the results of operations of companies we acquired beginning on their acquisition date and increased stockbased compensation expense beginning in the fourth quarter of 2005 following our adoption of sfas 123r at the beginning of that quarter a detailed discussion of these results follows the table below 

  

     

revenue for 2006 2005 and 2004 reflects the following 

  

   

   

revenue by product category for 2006 2005 and 2004 reflects the following 

  

   

   

total costs and expenses reflect increases in our operating cost structure from acquisitions and from measured increases to support our revenue growth as well as the following 

  

   

   

   

   

the provision for income taxes in 2006 2005 and 2004 is net of tax benefits totaling 61 million 121 million and 189 million respectively the 2006 and 2004 benefits resulted from favorable resolutions of tax audits with the internal revenue service in the us the 2005 benefit resulted from favorable resolutions of tax audits in a nonus jurisdiction 

  

net income was 609 million in 2006 836 million in 2005 and 348 million in 2004 reflecting improved operating margin contributions from increased revenue year over year offset by the impact of the items discussed above 

  

the following table shows certain consolidated financial data as a percentage of our total revenue for the last three years 

  

   

revenue 

  

our revenue consists of software license revenue and service revenue which includes software maintenance revenue consisting of providing our customers software updates and technical support as well as consulting including implementation services and training revenue 

  

we report our revenue in two product categories 

  

   

   

through the end of the third quarter of 2005 half of prointralink revenue was allocated to desktop solutions and half was allocated to enterprise solutions as a result of the new windchillbased technology configuration of prointralink 80 beginning as of the fourth quarter of 2005 all prointralink revenue is classified as enterprise solutions 

  

total revenue 

  

the following table illustrates trends from 2004 to 2006 in our software license and service revenues as well as by product category and geography 

  

      

in 2006 and 2005 we had yearoveryear revenue growth in both desktop solutions and enterprise solutions we attribute this growth to execution of our strategic initiatives an increase in the number of new seats sold in both product categories and increased technology spending by our customers particularly in north america the revenue growth reflects both organic growth of our enterprise solutions and desktop solutions and revenue from the recently acquired arbortext and mathsoft businesses historically arbortext generated revenue of approximately 40 million for the twelve months ended june 30 2005 and mathsoft generated revenue of approximately 20 million for the twelve months ended march 31 2006 prior to our acquisitions of those businesses the arbortext and mathsoft businesses have been included in our results of operations since their acquisition dates arbortext on july 19 2005 and mathsoft on april 28 2006 accordingly 2005 results do not include mathsoft and include arbortext only for the fourth quarter 2006 results include mathsoft for approximately 5 months since april 29 2006 

  

license revenue  license revenue accounted for 31 29 and 30 of total revenue in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively the growth in license revenue in 2006 compared to 2005 was primarily due to organic growth in both enterprise solutions and desktop solutions including contributions from our reseller channel and contributions from arbortext and beginning in the third quarter of 2006 mathsoft 

  

maintenance revenue  maintenance revenue represented 43 48 and 49 of total revenues in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively maintenance revenue increased in both 2006 and 2005 versus the comparable prior year periods but the percentage that maintenance revenue constitutes of total revenue has declined as a result of faster growth of our consulting and training revenue and in 2006 license revenue 

  

consulting and training revenue  consulting and training service revenue which has a lower gross profit margin than license and maintenance revenue accounted for 26 23 and 21 of total revenue in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively growth in consulting and training services revenue is attributable to increased use by our customer base of our consulting and training services including our expanding suite of computerbased training products as well as contributions from acquired businesses as 

  

we have increased our service revenue we have focused on improving our consulting and training service profit margins by improving consulting staff utilization and growing revenue from highermargin sources such as computerbased training products 

  

revenue from individual customers  we enter into customer contracts that may result in revenue being recognized over multiple reporting periods accordingly revenue recognized in a current period may be attributable to contracts entered into during the current period or in prior periods license andor consulting and training service revenue of 1 million or more recognized from individual customers in a single quarter during the fiscal year was 1417 million 851 million and 770 million in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively this increase is attributable to a significant increase in the number of customers that spent over 1 million during each quarter in 2006 compared to 2005 while our customers may not continue to spend at these levels in future periods we believe this increase is the result of a shift in customer priorities toward plm solutions relative to other it spending initiatives our improved ability to provide broader solutions to our customers and improvements in our competitive position due to our system architecture and product development process knowledge 

  

revenue by geography  we derived 58 62 and 65 of our total revenue from sales to customers outside of north america in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively total revenue growth in north america was primarily due to organic growth and contributions from the recently acquired arbortext and mathsoft businesses whose revenues were concentrated in that region we believe the improvements in our 2006 and 2005 revenue in north america are attributable to implementation of our strategic initiatives and also indicate that the economy in that region where the manufacturing sector and related technology spending had been weak has improved since 2004 

  

our european revenue in 2006 reflects improvement in sales and services performance in strategic accounts in that region the increase in european revenue in 2006 compared to 2005 was due primarily to strong performance in enterprise solutions including growth in license consulting and training service and maintenance revenue we also experienced growth in desktop solutions particularly license and consulting and training service revenue the increase in european revenue in 2005 compared to 2004 was due primarily to the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates 

  

revenue performance in asiapacific for 2006 compared to 2005 reflected a 34 increase in revenue in the pacific rim subregion offset by a 14 decrease in revenue in the japan subregion we believe that the growth in the pacific rim reflects improved market opportunity and better execution after strategic and organizational changes we made in that region earlier in 2006 we believe the revenue decreases in japan were partially attributable to market dynamics and partially attributable to our operational execution problems we have recently made organizational and strategic changes in japan and believe these changes will help improve our results there revenue performance in asiapacific in 2005 compared to 2004 reflected a 12 increase in revenues in the pacific rim partially offset by a 1 decrease in revenues in japan which experienced a decline in license revenue from large deals partially offset by an increase in consulting and training service revenue we believe the asiapacific region particularly china continues to present an important growth opportunity because global manufacturing companies have continued to invest in that region and the market in that region for both our desktop solutions and enterprise solutions is relatively unsaturated 

  

revenue from our reseller channel  we have been building and diversifying our reseller channel to become less dependent on a small number of resellers and to provide the resources necessary for more effective distribution of our products although we typically receive lower revenue per seat for an indirect sale versus a direct sale we believe that using diverse and geographically dispersed resellers that focus on smaller businesses provides an efficient and cost effective means to reach these customers and allows our direct sales force to focus on larger sales opportunities total sales from our reseller channel which are primarily for our desktop solutions were 1715 million 20 of total revenue in 2006 1386 million 19 of total revenue in 2005 and 1359 million 21 of total revenue in 2004 we attribute the revenue increase in our reseller channel to our efforts to expand our reseller channel to the success of proengineer wildfire among small and mediumsize businesses as proengineer wildfire has become increasingly competitive in this market both relative to our historic offerings as well as to competitive offerings in this market segment and to sales of recently acquired arbortext and mathsoft products in each year we continued to experience growth in our reseller channel revenue in north america and europe and in 2006 we also experienced strong growth in our reseller channel in asiapacific we attribute the improvement in our asiapacific reseller channel performance in 2006 to organizational and infrastructure changes we made in that region in the first half of the year 

  

enterprise solutions revenue 

  

the following table illustrates trends from 2004 to 2006 in our enterprise solutions software license revenue and service revenue 

  

   

total revenue from our enterprise solutions software and related services was 34 30 and 27 of our total revenue in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively 

  

the increases in enterprise solutions revenue in 2006 and 2005 compared to the prior year reflect 

  

   

   

   

   

the launch of prointralink 80 increased revenue in three ways first through the end of the third quarter of 2005 half of prointralink revenue was allocated to desktop solutions and half was allocated to enterprise solutions as a result of the new windchillbased technology configuration of prointralink 80 beginning as of the fourth quarter of 2005 all prointralink revenue is classified as enterprise solutions second we have announced that our earlier versions of prointralink will be maintained only through mid2008 accordingly customers will be migrating from their current versions of prointralink to prointralink 80 through that date which we expect will increase our consulting and training service revenue but not our license revenue third the fact that prointralink 80 is based on windchill makes it easier for customers to adopt windchill throughout their organization by enabling customers to manage their proengineer data on a windchill platform we believe prointralink 80 incorporates significant enhancements to our product development system and will increase customer adoption of windchill 

  

license revenue  enterprise solutions license revenue grew 36 and 19 in 2006 and 2005 respectively compared to the prior year the increase in enterprise solutions license revenue in 2006 as compared to 2005 was primarily attributable to organic growth as well as to sales of our arbortext products the number of new windchill seats sold in both 2006 and 2005 increased as compared to the prior year periods which we believe reflects our success in marketing incremental adoption of our solutions as well as our improved competitive position 

  

maintenance revenue  increases in our enterprise solutions maintenance revenue in each year were due primarily to an increase in the number of new users of our enterprise solutions as new customers were added and existing customers expanded their implementations to additional users 

  

consulting and training service revenue  increases in our enterprise solutions consulting and training service revenue from 2005 to 2006 were due to planned growth in services capacity to address increased customer demand for process and implementation 

  

consulting services as well as the addition of arbortext which had a significant services business for its publishing solutions consulting and training service revenue in 2004 was adversely affected by our reduced services delivery capacity due to our 2004 headcount reductions 

  

market opportunity  we believe small and mediumsize businesses represent an important revenue growth opportunity for our enterprise solutions in the future accordingly we are expanding our distribution of plm solutions by offering qualified resellers the ability to sell our windchill link solutions as well as related services in addition we now offer on demand versions of several windchill link solutions that help minimize customers’ cost of ownership and reduce implementation time the revenue contribution from these initiatives is growing but was not material in 2006 2005 or 2004 

  

desktop solutions revenue 

  

the following table illustrates trends from 2004 to 2006 in our desktop solutions software license revenue and service revenue 

  

   

total revenue from our desktop solutions and related services was 66 70 and 73 of our total revenue in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively the increase in desktop solutions revenue in 2006 as compared to 2005 was due primarily to increases in sales of our entrylevel package of proengineer and sales of related modules and package upgrades throughout our customer base as well as to sales of products from the recently acquired arbortext and mathsoft businesses this growth was partially offset by a slight decline in revenue from our highend package of proengineer particularly in japan we believe our decision to offer proengineer packages with differing price points and functionality will continue to contribute to adoption of these solutions we designed these packages to address our customers’ purchasing patterns and to better compete in the small and mediumsize business segment of our market our desktop solutions are now more competitive with lowerend modeling tools on the market that are known for ease of use but still maintain the functionality for which proengineer is known additionally we are focusing on ensuring that our desktop solutions continue to address the evolving needs of our customers in the second quarter of 2006 we released our latest version of proengineer wildfire 30 which includes enhancements in personal and process productivity and quality 

  

license revenue  the increase in desktop solutions license revenue in 2006 compared to 2005 was due primarily to organic growth primarily from higher sales of our entrylevel package of proengineer and related modules and package upgrades and to the revenue contribution from arbortext and mathsoft products the total number of new proengineer seats added during 2006 increased 8 compared to the number of new seats added in 2005 the yearoveryear decline in license revenue in 2005 was primarily due to lower revenue from highend packages in 2005 particularly from large deals in japan in 2004 not replicated in 2005 despite lower revenue from highend packages in 2005 compared to 2004 sales of our lowend and midrange packages within our installed base and to new customers increased during that period and the total number of new proengineer seats added during 2005 increased 12 compared to new seats added in 2004 

  

maintenance revenue  the increase in our desktop solutions maintenance revenue in 2006 and 2005 was due in part to revenue contributions from our acquired businesses particularly arbortext and increases in the maintenance revenue per seat due to the configuration of seats under maintenance 

  

consulting and training service revenue  the increase in desktop solutions consulting and training service revenue in 2006 compared to 2005 and 2005 compared to 2004 is due to the increase in the number of new seats sold in these years versus the prior 

  

years as well as from higher revenue from sales of consulting services and training packages including computerbased training products which help our customers improve user proficiency and engineering productivity 

  

market opportunity  despite improvements over the past year desktop solutions revenue growth continues to be adversely affected by the relative maturity and saturation of the north american and european cadcamcae markets the difficulty associated with displacing incumbent product design systems in the discrete manufacturing computeraided design market and increased competition and price pressure from products offering more limited functionality at lower cost we believe the asiapacific region continues to present an opportunity for growth because the market is relatively unsaturated the number of mechanical engineers is growing and companies are continuing to migrate from twodimensional to threedimensional design tools we expect that recent organizational and infrastructure changes we have made in that region will result in higher revenue growth in asiapacific over time 

  

costs and expenses 

  

over the past several years we have made significant investments necessary to transform our business from providing a single line of technical software with a largely direct distribution model supplemented by a small number of channel partners to providing integrated product development system solutions with an expanded channel and partnerinvolved distribution model as part of this process 

  

   

   

all cost and expense categories from 2004 to 2006 have been impacted by our restructuring actions and acquisitions the following table illustrates trends from 2004 to 2006 in our costs and expenses 

  

    

effective july 3 2005 we adopted sfas 123r sharebased payment  accordingly for the full year of 2006 and the three months ended september 30 2005 stockbased compensation was accounted for under sfas 123r which requires the expensing of the fair value of stockbased awards in our consolidated statements of operations while for the nine months ended july 2 2005 and for 2004 stockbased compensation was accounted for under apb no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees  which required only the expensing of the intrinsic value of stockbased awards in addition in the fourth quarter of 2006 we announced that we had commenced a review of our historic stock option grant practices under the supervision of the audit committee of our board of directors we completed our review in november 2006 based on the results of our review we recorded a stockbased compensation charge of 23 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 to correct the priorperiod errors identified 

  

the amounts in the table above include the following amounts for stockbased compensation expense from our stockbased awards our stock option grant practice review and the stock option exchange we completed in 2005 

  

   

total costs and expenses 

  

2006 compared to 2005  total costs and expenses increased to 7832 million in 2006 compared to 6349 million in 2005 headcount increased to 4309 at the end of 2006 from 3751 at the end of 2005 our increase in costs and expenses including headcount was primarily due to the following 

  

   

   

   

   

2005 compared to 2004  total costs and expenses increased to 6349 million in 2005 compared to 6226 million in 2004 headcount increased to 3751 at the end of 2005 from 3042 at the end of 2004 our increase in costs and expenses including headcount was primarily due to the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

cost of license revenue 

  

our cost of license revenue consists of fixed and variable costs associated with reproducing and distributing software and documentation as well as royalties paid to third parties for technology embedded in or licensed with our software products cost of license revenue as a percentage of license revenue was 5 for 2006 and 4 for 2005 and 2004 the increase in cost of license revenue in 2006 compared to 2005 is due primarily to higher amortization of purchased software of approximately 31 million attributable to acquisitions completed since the second half of 2005 cost of license revenue as a percent of license revenue can 

  

vary depending on product mix sold and the effect of fixed and variable royalties and the level of amortization of acquired software intangible assets 

  

cost of service revenue 

  

our cost of service revenue includes costs associated with training customer support and consulting personnel such as salaries and related costs thirdparty subcontractor fees costs associated with the release of maintenance updates including related royalty costs and facility costs cost of service revenue as a percentage of service revenue was 44 in 2006 39 in 2005 and 38 in 2004 service margins can vary based on the product mix sold in the period services margins in 2006 were lower than in 2005 primarily due to the change in accounting for stockbased compensation described above a higher percentage of consulting and training services revenue which has a lower margin than maintenance revenue relative to total service revenue and lower than expected revenue performance in the asiapacific region particularly in japan servicerelated employee headcount increased 27 and 28 at the end of 2006 and 2005 each compared to the prior year at the end of 2006 2005 and 2004 services headcount was 1291 1019 and 797 respectively total salaries commissions benefits and travel costs were higher by an aggregate of approximately 417 million and 140 million in 2006 and 2005 respectively compared to the prior year including 51 million and 26 million in 2006 and 2005 respectively related to the change in accounting for stockbased compensation described above these costs were higher due to planned increases including by acquisition in our services delivery capacity and higher commissions due to the increase in service revenue in 2005 these increases were partially offset by reductions in employee benefit costs primarily medical and costs related to employees on expatriate assignments the cost of thirdparty consulting services was 147 million and 82 million higher in 2006 and 2005 respectively compared to the prior year periods due to the use of such services in support of increases in consulting and training services revenue royalty costs were 02 million lower and 35 million higher in 2006 and 2005 respectively compared to the prior year the higher costs in 2006 and 2005 relative to 2004 were due primarily to a 50 million onetime benefit recorded in 2004 as a result of a contract renegotiation finalized in 2004 

  

sales and marketing 

  

our sales and marketing expenses primarily include salaries and benefits sales commissions advertising and marketing programs travel and facility costs sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenue were 32 in 2006 and 34 in both 2005 and 2004 total sales and marketing employee headcount increased 5 and 15 at the end of 2006 and 2005 respectively compared to the prior year at the end of 2006 2005 and 2004 sales and marketing headcount was 1145 1087 and 945 respectively total salaries commissions benefits and travel costs were higher by an aggregate of approximately 292 million and 234 million in 2006 and 2005 respectively compared to the prior year including 60 million and 51 million in 2006 and 2005 respectively related to the change in accounting for stockbased compensation described above sales and marketing costs were higher in 2006 and 2005 due to planned increases including by acquisition in headcount and higher commissions due primarily to increased license and service revenue and in 2005 changes to our commission structure in addition marketing program costs were 14 million and 27 million higher in 2006 and 2005 respectively compared to the prior year due to an increase in our marketing activities the cost increases in 2005 were partially offset by lower costs related to fewer employees on expatriate assignments and a 50 million decrease in depreciation rent telephone and office support costs due to facility closures and consolidations 

  

research and development 

  

our research and development expenses consist principally of salaries and benefits costs of computer equipment and facility expenses major research and development activities include developing new releases of our software that work together in a more integrated fashion and that include functionality enhancements desired by our customers we released proengineer wildfire 30 in march 2006 and released windchill 80 in the third quarter of 2005 including the launch of prointralink 80 research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenue were 17 in 2006 and 16 in both 2005 and 2004 research and development headcount increased 16 and 28 at the end of 2006 and 2005 respectively compared to the prior year at the end of 2006 2005 and 2004 research and development headcount was 1437 1242 and 971 respectively total salaries benefits and travel costs were higher in 2006 and 2005 compared to the prior year by an aggregate of approximately 242 million and 112 million respectively including 52 million and 34 million in 2006 and 2005 respectively related to the change in accounting for stockbased compensation described above in addition the cost of thirdparty development services was higher by 12 million and 30 million in 2006 and 2005 respectively compared to the prior year 

  

general and administrative 

  

our general and administrative expenses include the costs of our corporate finance information technology human resources legal and administrative functions as well as bad debt expense general and administrative expenses also include costs associated with outside professional services including accounting and legal fees general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue were 9 in 2006 2005 and 2004 general and administrative headcount increased by 9 and 23 at the end of 2006 and 2005 respectively compared to the prior year at the end of 2006 2005 and 2004 general and administrative headcount was 420 385 and 314 respectively total salaries benefits and travel costs were higher in 2006 and 2005 compared to the prior year by an aggregate of approximately 126 million and 69 million respectively including 87 million and 39 million for 2006 and 2005 respectively related to the change in accounting for stockbased compensation described above our general and administrative expenses in 2006 also included a 23 million charge related to our settlement agreement with rand a former distributor of our products the cost of outside professional services decreased by 16 million in 2006 compared to an increase of 35 million in 2005 over the comparable prior year the higher outside professional service fees in 2005 compared to 2006 and 2004 were primarily related to corporate development initiatives and our initial year of reporting on internal control over financial reporting the cost increases in 2005 were partially offset by a 41 million reduction in depreciation rent office support and insurance costs and a 15 million decrease in bad debt expense bad debt expense in 2006 2005 and 2004 was 15 million 16 million and 31 million respectively we attribute the decrease in bad debt expense in 2006 and 2005 over 2004 to improved credit risk management improved economic conditions and the maturity of our reseller channel 

  

amortization of acquired intangible assets 

  

the amortization of acquired intangible assets line item on our statement of operations reflects the amortization of nonproduct related intangible assets from acquisitions amortization of these acquisitionrelated intangible assets which totaled 61 million 16 million and 52 million in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively primarily includes the amortization of customerrelated intangibles the increases in 2006 compared to 2005 were due to amortization of intangible assets resulting from our six acquisitions completed in the second half of 2005 and the first nine months of 2006 the decrease in 2005 compared to 2004 was due to certain intangible assets being fully amortized in 2004 partially offset by amortization of intangible assets resulting from our acquisitions in 2004 and 2005 we expect amortization of nonproduct related intangible assets from our completed acquisitions to total approximately 69 million in 2007 

  

our acquisition of mathsoft in the third quarter of 2006 resulted in an increase in acquired intangible assets of 256 million and goodwill of 420 million acquired intangible assets consisted of 139 million of customer relationship intangibles 103 million of purchased software and 14 million of trademarks and distributor networks each of which are being amortized over estimated useful lives of 7 to 10 years 5 years and 5 years respectively 

  

our acquisitions of denc ag and substantially all of the assets of cadtrain inc in the first quarter of 2006 resulted in 43 million of goodwill and 59 million of other acquired intangible assets primarily comprised of customer relationship intangibles which are being amortized over a weighted average of 83 years 

  

our acquisition of arbortext in the fourth quarter of 2005 resulted in an increase in acquired intangible assets of 466 million and goodwill of 1516 million acquired intangible assets consisted of 353 million of customer relationship intangibles 105 million of purchased software and 08 million of trademarks each of which are being amortized over estimated useful lives of 10 years 3 to 5 years and 5 years respectively 

  

our acquisitions of polyplan technologies inc and aptavis technologies corporation in the third quarter of 2005 resulted in an increase in goodwill of 56 million and acquired intangible assets of 33 million primarily comprised of purchased software which is being amortized over 3 years 

  

our acquisition of ohio design automation inc in the third quarter of 2004 resulted in an increase in acquired intangible assets of 34 million and goodwill of 70 million acquired intangible assets consisted of 18 million of customer lists and 16 million of purchased software which are being amortized over estimated useful lives of 5 years and 3 years respectively 

  

inprocess research and development 

  

in the third quarter of 2006 we recorded a charge of 21 million for inprocess research and development in connection with our acquisition of mathsoft related to a project under development for which technological feasibility had not yet been established at the acquisition date and for which there was no alternative future use the value of the purchased inprocess research and development was determined using the residual income approach which discounts expected future cash flows from projects under development to their net present value this development project is expected to be completed by the first quarter of 2007 and the expected cost to complete was approximately 08 million at the acquisition date 

  

in the fourth quarter of 2005 we recorded a charge of 07 million for inprocess research and development related to two arbortext projects under development for which technological feasibility had not yet been established at the acquisition date and for which there was no alternative future use the value of the purchased inprocess research and development was determined using the residual income approach which discounts expected future cash flows from projects under development to their net present value the expected cost to complete was approximately 2 million as of the acquisition date these development projects were completed in 2006 as expected 

  

restructuring and other charges credits 

  

in 2006 2005 and 2004 we recorded restructuring and other charges credits of 59 million 13 million and 429 million respectively primarily associated with reductions in workforce and excess facility obligations to reduce our cost structure and to improve profitability during those same periods we made cash payments related to restructuring and other charges including payments relating to restructuring and other charges recorded prior to 2004 of 152 million 108 million and 406 million respectively amounts not yet paid at september 30 2006 relating to restructuring and other charges taken during the current and all prior periods were 224 million and primarily relate to excess facility obligations to be paid out through 2014 of the total amount accrued at september 30 2006 we expect to make cash disbursements within the next twelve months of approximately 8 million for restructuring charges incurred in 2006 and prior periods 

  

in the third quarter of 2006 we recorded a net restructuring charge of 59 million the net restructuring charge included 74 million of severance and related costs associated with the termination of 91 employees in the third quarter of 2006 partially offset by a credit of 15 million primarily related to a plan to reoccupy a portion of our headquarters facility that was previously vacated and had been included in restructuring costs in prior periods the headquarters space was available for sublease and was being marketed but is being reoccupied due to space requirements related to our acquisition of mathsoft as of september 30 2006 substantially all of our remaining excess headquarters space had been sublet 

  

in the fourth quarter of 2005 we recorded a net credit to restructuring and other charges of 13 million the restructuring credit includes a 30 million credit for changes in our estimated liabilities for facilities that we vacated offset by 17 million of severance and termination costs related to nine employees terminated during the period the 30 million credit was due primarily to reoccupying in the fourth quarter of 2005 a portion of our headquarters facility that was previously vacated and included in restructuring costs in a prior period the space was available for sublease and was being marketed but was reoccupied due to space requirements related to our three acquisitions completed in 2005 and general business growth 

  

in 2004 we recorded restructuring and other charges of 210 million for severance and termination benefits related to 459 employees terminated during 2004 and 219 million related primarily to excess facilities the charges for excess facilities were primarily related to gross lease commitments in excess of estimated sublease income for excess facilities of the total restructuring and other charges recorded in 2004 19 million was noncash for the writeoff of leasehold improvements related to the excess facilities we completed the restructuring program in the fourth quarter of 2004 

  

interest income 

  

interest income relates to earnings on the investment of our available cash balances and totaled 54 million 69 million and 35 million in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively interest income was lower in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily due to lower average cash balances as a result of acquisitions completed in the second half of 2005 and the first nine months of 2006 the increase in 2005 compared to 2004 was related primarily to higher average cash balances and interest rates 

  

other expense net 

  

other expense net includes costs of hedging contracts certain realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains or losses charges incurred in connection with financing customer contracts writedowns of investments and foreign exchange gains or losses resulting from the required periodend currency remeasurement of the assets and liabilities of our subsidiaries that use the us dollar as their functional currency a large portion of our revenue and expenses is transacted in foreign currencies to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates we engage in hedging transactions involving the use of foreign currency forward contracts primarily in western european and asian currencies other expense net totaled 17 million 14 million and 39 million 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively the decrease in other expense net in 2005 compared to 2004 was due primarily to lower charges in connection with financing customer contracts which were 08 million in 2005 and 21 million in 2004 

  

income taxes 

  

our income tax provision has fluctuated significantly in terms of amount and rate in each of the past three years due primarily to the impact of discrete events such as settlements of tax audits which created onetime income tax benefits our effective tax rate was 19 on pretax income of 754 million in 2006 8 on pretax income of 913 million in 2005 and 6 on pretax income of 370 million in 2004 in 2006 our effective tax rate of 19 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate of 35 due primarily to a 61 million benefit recorded upon settlement of prior year tax audits in the us discussed below as well as our use of net operating loss carryforwards nols to offset our 2006 us taxable income which reduced the valuation allowance we had previously recorded against those nols in 2005 our effective tax rate of 8 was lower than the 35 statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a tax benefit of 121 million arising from a reduction of our tax liabilities upon favorable resolution of tax audits in a foreign jurisdiction the benefit of foreign taxes paid at a net effective tax rate lower than that in the us and the benefit from the reversal of 41 million of valuation allowances in certain foreign jurisdictions due to their consistent profitability in 2004 our effective tax rate of 6 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate of 35 due primarily to an 189 million tax benefit related to a us federal income tax refund discussed below offset by us taxable losses for the year that could not be benefited as well as incremental taxes payable in certain foreign jurisdictions 

  

in 2002 we recorded a full valuation allowance to completely reserve against our deferred tax assets which consist primarily of operating loss carryforwards due to the uncertainty of their realization as of the end of the of 2006 2005 and 2004 a full valuation allowance was still recorded against remaining deferred tax assets in the us primarily related to operating loss carryforwards and certain foreign jurisdictions while we have realized consolidated operating profits over the past three years and last several quarters we have only recently begun to show consistent profitability in the us and as recently as the fourth quarter of 2005 our us legal entities incurred a taxable loss principally due to the tax expense associated with the grant and vesting of restricted stock units and our employee stock option exchange accordingly we have not yet concluded that realization of all of our deferred tax assets in the future is more likely than not 

  

although we concluded that the full valuation allowance was still required on the us net deferred tax assets as of the end of 2006 we anticipate that it may be appropriate to reverse some or all of our us valuation allowance of 109 million sometime during 2007 if our financial performance continues to improve if and when we conclude that realization of our deferred tax assets is more likely than not we would record a reduction to our us valuation allowance that will decrease our tax provision and increase net income reduce goodwill andor increase additional paidin capital in the period such determination is made at the time of the reversal of the us valuation allowance we would record a noncash income tax benefit which would result in a significant onetime benefit to our net income during the period in which it is recorded once we reverse the us valuation allowance we will return to recording a full income tax provision for us profit in our statement of operations therefore our effective tax rate on pretax income is likely to increase however until our net operating loss carryforwards are fully utilized over the next several years we will continue to receive a cash benefit from the use of net operating loss carryforwards as future cash tax payments would be reduced 

  

in the normal course of business ptc and its subsidiaries are examined by various taxing authorities including the internal revenue service irs in the united states in connection with one such audit in the third quarter of 2006 we reached final agreement with the irs and made federal income tax payments totaling 95 million for liabilities arising from our income tax returns for fiscal years 2001 and 2002 as a result of this final agreement and the tax payments made being less than the accrued 

  

income taxes that we had recorded for those years we recorded an income tax benefit in the third quarter of 2006 of 61 million in 2005 we recorded tax benefits of 121 million arising from the reduction of our tax liabilities upon the favorable resolution of foreign jurisdiction tax audits in fiscal 2004 the irs concluded its examination of our income tax returns for fiscal years 1998 through 2000 resulting in a tax refund including interest to us of 395 million we received notice of the refund amount in the fourth quarter of 2004 and we received the refund in the first quarter of 2005 the refund resulted in a nonrecurring tax benefit of 189 million in 2004 

  

our future effective tax rate may be materially impacted by the amount of income taxes associated with our earnings outside the us which are taxed at rates different from the us federal statutory rate as well as the timing and extent of the realization of deferred tax assets and changes in the tax law further our tax rate may fluctuate within a fiscal year including from quarter to quarter due to items arising from discrete events including settlements of tax audits and assessments the resolution or identification of tax position uncertainties and acquisitions of other companies 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

we have prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america in preparing our financial statements we make estimates assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our reported revenues results from operations and net income as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet these estimates assumptions and judgments about future events and their effects on our results cannot be determined with certainty and are made based on our historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances these estimates may change as new events occur or additional information is obtained and we may periodically be faced with uncertainties the outcomes of which are not within our control and may not be known for a prolonged period of time 

  

while there are a number of accounting policies methods and estimates affecting our financial statements described in note a of notes to consolidated financial statements  the areas that are our most important critical accounting policies and estimates are described below and include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

a critical accounting policy is one that is both material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires us to make difficult subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate and different estimates that we could have used or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process actual results could differ from those estimates 

  

accounting policies guidelines and interpretations related to our critical accounting policies and estimates are generally subject to numerous sources of authoritative guidance and are often reexamined by accounting standards rule makers and regulators these rule makers andor regulators may promulgate interpretations guidance or regulations that may result in changes to our accounting policies which could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 

  

revenue recognition 

  

while we apply the guidance of statement of position sop no 972 software revenue recognition and statement of position no 989 modification of sop 972 software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions both issued by the american institute of certified public accountants as well as sec staff accounting bulletin 104 revenue recognition we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amounts of software license and services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period our primary judgments involve the following 

  

   

   

   

   

we derive revenues from three primary sources 1 software licenses 2 maintenance services and 3 consulting and training services revenue by type for 2006 2005 and 2004 was as follows 

  

   

for software license arrangements that do not require significant modification or customization of the underlying software we recognize revenue when 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 2 delivery has occurred generally fob shipping point or electronic distribution 3 the fee is fixed or determinable and 4 collection is probable substantially all of our license revenues are recognized in this manner 

  

our software is distributed primarily through our direct sales force in addition we have an indirect distribution channel through alliances with resellers and for our mathsoft products with distributors approximately 20 of our total revenue in 2006 was generated from our indirect distributor channel revenue arrangements with resellers are recognized on a sellthrough basis that is when we receive persuasive evidence that the reseller has sold the products to an enduser customer we do not offer contractual rights of return stock balancing or price protection to our resellers and actual product returns from them have been insignificant to date as a result we do not maintain reserves for reseller product returns and related allowances in contrast revenue arrangements with distributors of our mathsoft products have a contractual right to exchange product and are recognized on a sellin basis that is when we ship the products to the distributor as of september 30 2006 the value of product inventory held by distributors and the accrual that we have recorded for estimated product returns were not material 

  

at the time of each sale transaction we must make an assessment of the collectibility of the amount due from the customer revenue is only recognized at that time if management deems that collection is probable in making this assessment we consider customer creditworthiness and historical payment experience at that same time we assess whether fees are fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties if the fee is not fixed or determinable revenue is recognized only as payments become due from the customer provided that all other revenue recognition criteria are met in assessing whether the fee is fixed or determinable we consider the payment terms of the transaction including transactions with payment terms that extend beyond twelve months and our collection experience in similar transactions without making concessions among other factors our software license arrangements generally do not include customer acceptance provisions however if an arrangement includes an acceptance provision we record revenue only upon the earlier of 1 receipt of written acceptance from the customer or 2 expiration of the acceptance period 

  

our software arrangements often include implementation and consulting services that are sold separately under consulting engagement contracts or as part of the software license arrangement when we determine that such services are not essential to the functionality of the licensed software and qualify as “service transactions” under sop 972 we record revenue separately for the license and service elements of these arrangements generally we consider that a service is not essential to the functionality of the software based on various factors including if the services may be provided by independent third parties experienced in providing such consulting and implementation in coordination with dedicated customer personnel if an arrangement does not qualify for separate accounting of the license and service elements then license revenue is recognized together with the consulting services using either the percentageofcompletion or completedcontract method of contract accounting contract accounting is also applied to any software arrangements that include customerspecific acceptance criteria or where the license payment is tied to the performance of consulting services under the percentageofcompletion method we estimate the stage of completion of contracts with fixed or “not to exceed” fees based on hours or costs incurred to date as compared with estimated total project hours or costs at completion if we do not have a sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion revenue is recognized upon completion of the contract when total cost estimates exceed revenues we accrue for the estimated losses when identified the use of the percentageofcompletion method of accounting requires significant judgment relative to estimating total contract costs including assumptions relative to the length of time to complete the project the nature and complexity of the work to be performed and anticipated changes in salaries and other costs when adjustments in estimated contract costs are determined such revisions may have the effect of adjusting in the current period the earnings applicable to performance in prior periods 

  

we generally use the residual method to recognize revenues from arrangements that include one or more elements to be delivered at a future date when evidence of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists under the residual method the fair value of the undelivered elements eg maintenance consulting and training services based on vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements ie software license if evidence of the fair value of one or more of the undelivered services does not exist all revenues are deferred and recognized when delivery of all of those services has occurred or when fair values can be established we determine vsoe of the fair value of services revenues based upon our recent pricing for those services when sold separately vsoe of the fair value of maintenance services may also be determined based on a substantive maintenance renewal clause if any within a customer contract our current pricing practices are influenced primarily by product type purchase volume maintenance term and customer location we review services revenues sold separately and maintenance renewal rates on a periodic basis and update when appropriate our vsoe of fair value for such services to ensure that it reflects our recent pricing experience 

  

valuation of assets and liabilities of business combinations 

  

in accordance with business combination accounting we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and inprocess research and development based on their estimated fair values determining these fair values requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets 

  

our identifiable intangible assets acquired consist of developed technology core technology tradenames customer lists and contracts software support agreements and related relationships and consulting contracts developed technology consists of products that have reached technological feasibility core technology represents a combination of processes inventions and trade secrets related to the design and development of acquired products customer lists and contracts and software support agreements and related relationships represent the underlying relationships and agreements with customers of the acquired company’s installed base we have generally valued intangible assets using a discounted cash flow model critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to 

  

   

   

   

   

in addition we estimate the useful lives of our intangible assets based upon the expected period over which we anticipate generating economic benefits from the related intangible asset 

  

net tangible assets consist of the fair values of tangible assets less the fair values of assumed liabilities and obligations except for deferred revenues and restructuring reserves net tangible assets were generally valued by us at the respective carrying amounts recorded by the acquired company as we believed that their carrying values approximated their fair values at the acquisition date 

  

the values assigned to deferred revenue reflect an amount equivalent to the estimated cost plus an appropriate profit margin to perform the services related to the acquired company’s software support contracts restructuring reserves include the severance costs related to employees of the acquired company planned closure of certain facilities and other costs associated with exiting activities of the acquired company 

  

our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable at that time but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions estimates or actual results 

  

valuation of goodwill and acquired intangible assets 

  

our net goodwill and acquired intangible assets totaled 3271 million and 2588 million as of september 30 2006 and 2005 respectively as described in note m of “notes to consolidated financial statements” we have two reporting units 1 our software products segment and 2 our services segment as of september 30 2006 and 2005 goodwill and acquired intangible assets in the aggregate attributable to our software products segment was 3009 million and 2426 million respectively and attributable to our services segment was 262 million and 162 million respectively the increase in goodwill and acquired intangible assets in 2006 was due primarily to our acquisition of mathsoft which resulted in goodwill and acquired intangible assets of 676 million 

  

we assess the impairment of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets on at least an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable factors we consider important on an overall company basis and reportable segment basis as applicable that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results significant changes in our use of the acquired assets or a significant change in the strategy for our business significant negative industry or economic trends a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period or a reduction of our market capitalization relative to net book value 

  

the goodwill impairment test prescribed by sfas 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires us to identify reporting units and to determine estimates of the fair values of our reporting units as of the date we test for impairment to conduct these tests of goodwill the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value if the reporting unit’s carrying value 

exceeded its fair value we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value of goodwill and its fair value we estimate the fair values of our reporting units using discounted cash flow valuation models those models require estimates of future revenues profits capital expenditures working capital and discount rates for each reporting unit we estimate these amounts by evaluating historical trends current budgets operating plans and industry data we conduct our annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite lived assets as of the end of the third quarter of each fiscal year we completed our annual impairment review as of the end of the third quarter of 2006 and concluded that no impairment charge was required as of that date 

  

for longlived assets and identifiable intangible assets other than goodwill we reassess the recoverability of the asset based on projected undiscounted future cash flows over the asset’s remaining life if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reportable segment below its carrying value when the carrying value of the asset exceeds its undiscounted cash flows we record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset determined using projected discounted future cash flows of the asset determining the fair value of our reporting units for the purpose of testing the potential impairment of individual assets and goodwill requires significant judgment by management different judgments could yield different results 

  

accounting for income taxes 

  

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to calculate our income tax expense based on taxable income by jurisdiction there are many transactions and calculations about which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain as a result our calculations involve estimates by management some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenuesharing costreimbursement and transfer pricing arrangements among related entities and the differing tax treatment of revenue and cost items across various jurisdictions if we were compelled to revise or to account differently for our arrangements that revision could affect our tax liability 

  

the income tax accounting process also involves estimating our actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheets we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized we must establish a valuation allowance as a charge to income tax expense 

  

in 2002 we increased our deferred tax asset valuation allowance and recorded a corresponding 480 million charge to income tax expense since that time we have maintained a full valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets in the us and certain foreign jurisdictions primarily related to net operating loss carryforwards the decision to record and maintain the valuation allowance required significant management judgment had we not recorded and maintained this valuation allowance we would have reported materially different results significant management judgment is required to determine when the realization of our deferred tax assets in the future is considered more likely than not if and when we conclude that realization is more likely than not we will record a reduction to our valuation allowance that will increase net income reduce goodwill andor increase additional paidin capital in the period such determination is made while we have realized consolidated operating profits over the past three years and last several quarters we have not yet concluded that realization of all of our deferred tax assets in the future in the us and in certain foreign jurisdictions is more likely than not 

  

net deferred tax assets at september 30 2006 were 45 million comprised of deferred tax assets of 1789 million partially offset by deferred tax liabilities of 401 million and a valuation allowance of 1343 million 

  

accounting for pensions 

  

we sponsor a frozen pension plan covering mostly inactive participants in the united states we make several assumptions that are used in calculating the expense and liability of the plans these key assumptions include the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate in selecting the expected longterm rate of return on assets we consider the average future rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits under the pension plan this includes considering the plan’s asset allocations and the expected returns likely to be earned over the life of this plan the discount rate reflects the estimated rate at which an amount that is invested in a portfolio of highquality debt instruments would provide the future cash flows necessary to pay benefits when they come due in addition our actuarial consultants determine the expense and liabilities of the plan using other assumptions for future experience such as mortality rates the actuarial assumptions used by us may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions or longer or shorter life spans of the participants our actual results could differ materially from those we estimated which could require us to record a greater amount of pension expense in future years in determining our pension cost for 2006 and 2005 we used a discount rate of 55 and 60 respectively and an expected return on plan assets of 75 for each year 

  

certain of our foreign subsidiaries also sponsor pension plans accounting and reporting for these plans requires the use of countryspecific assumptions for discount rates and expected rates of return on assets we apply a consistent methodology in determining the key assumptions that in addition to future experience assumptions such as mortality rates are used by our actuaries to determine our liability and expense for each of these plans for 2006 and 2005 we used weighted average discount rates of 50 and 49 respectively and a weighted average expected return on plan assets of 43 and 48 respectively 

  

the most sensitive assumptions used in calculating the expense and liability of our pension plans are the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets a 50 basis point change to our discount rate and expected return on plan assets assumptions would not have changed our pension expense for the year ended september 30 2006 by more than 15 million a 50 basis point decrease 

  

in our discount rate assumptions would increase our accumulated and projected benefit obligation as of september 30 2006 by approximately 12 million 

  

accounting for stockbased compensation 

  

we adopted sfas 123r on july 3 2005 effective with the beginning of our fourth quarter of 2005 sfas 123r requires us to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grantdate fair value of the award using an option pricing model that cost is recognized as an expense over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award prior to the adoption of sfas 123r we determined stockbased compensation in accordance with apb no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees  which required only the expensing of the intrinsic value of stockbased awards as substantially all of our stock options issued to employees had no intrinsic value at their date of grant our recognized stockbased compensation expense was immaterial prior to adoption of sfas 123r 

  

we historically granted stock options to employees and offered employees the opportunity to purchase shares under our employee stock purchase plan we did not grant any stock options during 2006 or 2005 and in mid2005 we suspended offerings under our employee stock purchase plan 

  

in connection with our adoption of sfas 123r we altered our equity incentive program to use restricted shares and restricted stock units as our principal equity incentive awards in 2006 and 2005 we granted shares of restricted stock to our directors and executive officers and granted restricted stock units to our employees our grants of shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units have either timebased vesting requirements or performancebased vesting requirements some of which are then subject to subsequent timebased restrictions if the performancebased targets are achieved under sfas 123r we determine the fair value of restricted shares and restricted stock units based on the excess of the fair market value of our common stock at the date of grant as compared to the exercise price if any of the award in determining the amount of expense to be recorded for restricted shares and restricted stock units judgment is required by us to estimate forfeitures of the awards and to assess the probability of achievement of performancebased award targets if actual forfeitures or actual performancebased target achievement differs from our estimates our results of operations could be impacted 

  

allowance for accounts and other receivables 

  

management judgment is required in assessing the collectibility of customer accounts and other receivables for which we generally do not require collateral we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments in determining the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts management specifically analyzes individual accounts receivable historical bad debts customer concentrations customer creditworthiness current economic conditions accounts receivable aging trends and changes in our customer payment terms our customer base consists of large numbers of geographically diverse customers dispersed across many industries and no individual customer comprised more than 10 of our net accounts receivable for any period presented the following table summarizes our accounts receivable and related reserve balances at september 30 2006 and 2005 

  

   

if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate additional allowances might be required resulting in future operating expenses that are not included in the allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts declined in 2006 compared to 2005 due to the writeoff in 2006 of uncollectible receivables totaling 23 million which exceeded the provision for bad debts required in 2006 of 15 million the allowance for bad debts as a percentage of gross accounts receivable 

  

can vary depending on the level and timing of quarterly revenue as well as the timing of the resolution of specifically reserved doubtful accounts receivable either via collection or writeoff 

  

restructuring charges 

  

we periodically record restructuring charges resulting from restructuring our operations including consolidations andor relocations of operations changes to our strategic plan or managerial responses to declines in demand increasing costs or other environmental factors the determination of restructuring charges requires management judgment and may include costs related to employee benefits such as costs of severance and termination benefits and estimates of costs for future lease commitments on excess facilities net of estimated future sublease income in determining the amount of the facilities charge we are required to estimate such factors as future vacancy rates the time required to sublet properties and sublease rates these estimates are reviewed quarterly based on known real estate market conditions and the creditworthiness of subtenants and may result in revisions to established facility reserves we have accrued 207 million as of september 30 2006 related to excess facilities compared to 297 million at september 30 2005 representing gross lease commitments with agreements expiring at various dates through 2014 of approximately 475 million net of committed and estimated sublease income of approximately 262 million and a present value factor of 06 million we have entered into signed sublease arrangements for approximately 230 million with the remaining 32 million based on future estimated sublease arrangements including 24 million for space currently available for sublease if our sublease assumptions prove to be inaccurate we may need to make changes in these estimates that would affect our results of operations and potentially our financial condition 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

   

we invest our cash with highly rated financial institutions and in diversified domestic and international money market mutual funds the portfolio is invested in shortterm instruments to ensure cash is available to meet requirements as needed 

  

cash and cash equivalents 

  

at september 30 2006 cash and cash equivalents totaled 1834 million compared to 2044 million at september 30 2005 and 2949 million at september 30 2004 the decrease in cash and cash equivalents in 2006 was due primarily to acquisitions of businesses which used cash of 751 million and additions to property and equipment of 195 million partially offset by 652 million of cash provided by operations and 78 million provided by net proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock plans the decrease in cash and cash equivalents in 2005 was due primarily to acquisitions of businesses which used cash of 1989 million payments for our employee stock option exchange totaling 127 million and additions to property equipment and intangible assets of 161 million partially offset by 1281 million of cash provided by operations and 102 million provided by net proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock plans 

  

cash provided by operating activities 

  

2006 compared to 2005 

  

cash provided by operating activities was 652 million in 2006 compared to 1281 million in 2005 cash provided by operating activities was lower primarily due to 

  

   

   

despite the increase in customer accounts receivable days sales outstanding were 67 days at september 30 2006 compared to 68 days at september 30 2005 

  

our operating cash flow in 2006 was adversely impacted by the increase in the amount of extended payment terms we offered to customers during the year we offer these terms to large customers with established payment and credit histories the amount of financing increased due to an increase in large deals in 2006 for which we provided financing particularly in the fourth quarter we provided extended payment terms on transactions accounting for approximately 51 million of revenue in 2006 which was approximately twice the amount of similar transactions in 2005 

  

2005 compared to 2004 

  

cash provided by operating activities was 1281 million in 2005 compared to 1013 million in 2004 the higher cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to 

  

   

   

   

these increases were offset by increases in current and noncurrent accounts receivable due in part to increased revenue in 2005 days sales outstanding remaining relatively flat at 68 days at september 30 2005 compared to 69 days at september 30 2004 and to our decision to decrease our sales of accounts receivable to thirdparty financial institutions in 2005 compared to prior years 

  

cash used by investing activities 

  

cash used by investing activities was 946 million in 2006 2150 million in 2005 and 223 million in 2004 in 2006 2005 and 2004 we had cash expenditures of 751 million 1989 million and 98 million respectively for business acquisitions net of cash acquired in 2006 we paid 644 million for the mathsoft acquisition 99 million for the denc and cadtrain acquisitions and 08 million related to the arbortext acquisition in 2005 we acquired arbortext for 1917 million net of cash acquired cash used for additions to property equipment and intangible assets was 195 million 161 million and 124 million in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively our expenditures for property and equipment consist primarily of computer equipment software office equipment and facility improvements 

  

cash provided used by financing activities 

  

cash provided used by financing activities was 65 million in 2006 20 million in 2005 and 97 million in 2004 the decrease in 2005 compared to 2006 and 2004 was primarily due to payments of 127 million related to our stock option exchange described below cash proceeds from the issuance of our common stock under our stock plans were 78 million 102 million and 97 million in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock plans was lower in 2006 than in prior years due to the fact that in connection with our adoption of sfas 123r we indefinitely suspended offerings under our employee stock purchase plan espp and began to use restricted stock and restricted stock units rather than stock options as our primary forms of equity compensation cash provided by financing activities in 2006 was net of 09 million of costs incurred to obtain our revolving credit facility described below 

  

credit facility 

  

on february 21 2006 we entered into a multicurrency bank revolving credit facility the credit facility consists of a 230 million revolving credit facility which may be increased up to an additional 150 million if the existing or additional lenders are willing to make increased commitments the credit facility expires on february 20 2011 when all amounts will be due and payable in full we expect to use the credit facility for general corporate purposes including acquisitions of businesses we have not borrowed any funds under the credit facility to date 

  

the credit facility limits our and our subsidiaries’ ability to among other things incur additional indebtedness incur liens or guarantee obligations pay dividends and make other distributions make investments and enter into joint ventures dispose of assets and engage in transactions with affiliates except on an armslength basis under the credit facility we and our material domestic subsidiaries may not invest cash or property in or loan cash to our foreign subsidiaries in aggregate amounts exceeding 25 million for any purpose and an additional 50 million for acquisitions of businesses in addition under the credit facility we and our subsidiaries must maintain specified leverage and fixedcharge ratios any failure to comply with the financial or operating covenants of the credit facility would not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds but would constitute a default resulting in among other things the amounts outstanding including all accrued interest and unpaid fees becoming immediately due and payable we were in compliance with all financial and operating covenants of the credit facility as of september 30 2006 

  

reverse stock split 

  

effective on february 28 2006 we implemented a reverse stock split pursuant to which every five shares of issued and outstanding common stock of ptc were automatically combined into two issued and outstanding shares of common stock without any change in the par value of such shares except for par values all references in this annual report to the number of shares of common stock restricted stock restricted stock units and stock options and to such per share amounts have been restated to reflect this reverse stock split 

  

stock option exchange 

  

in 2005 we completed a stock option exchange employees holding approximately 73 million eligible stock options elected to participate in the exchange the aggregate amount of the cash payments made to employees in exchange for their eligible options was 127 million and was paid in 2005 of this amount 05 million was recorded as compensation expense and 122 million was recorded as a charge to additional paidin capital in stockholders’ equity in accordance with the provisions of sfas 123r 

  

proceeds from equity issuances 

  

the espp and exercise of employee stock options generated cash proceeds of 78 million 102 million and 97 million in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively in 2005 in connection with our adoption of sfas 123r we changed our equity incentive program to award restricted stock and restricted stock units which require fewer shares than stock options to deliver comparable value the use of restricted shares and restricted stock units coupled with suspension of the espp has resulted in lower cash proceeds to us from sales of equity to our employees 

  

share repurchase authorization 

  

in september 1998 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 80 million shares of our common stock and in july 2000 increased the shares authorized for repurchase to 160 million we made no repurchases in 2006 2005 or 2004 since 1998 and through september 30 2006 we repurchased at a cost of 3668 million a total of 125 million shares of the 160 million shares authorized although we made no repurchases in 2006 2005 or 2004 we periodically consider repurchasing shares if we were to repurchase shares it would reduce our cash balances 

  

expectations for fiscal 2007 

  

we believe that existing cash and cash equivalents together with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements through at least the next twelve months 

  

during 2007 we expect to make cash disbursements estimated at 8 million for restructuring charges incurred in 2006 and prior periods and 2 million for costs associated with the execution of our acquisition integration plans capital expenditures for 2007 are currently anticipated to be approximately 20 million 

  

although we expect positive operating cash flow in 2007 we expect our cash balance to decrease at the end of the first quarter primarily due to our acquisition of itedo for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 17 million in cash and the payment of commissions and bonuses for 2006 during the quarter on a seasonal basis our cash balance is typically lowest in our first quarter 

  

we have evaluated and expect to continue to evaluate possible strategic transactions on an ongoing basis and at any given time may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to possible strategic transactions our cash position could be reduced and we may incur debt obligations to the extent we complete any significant transactions 

  

contractual obligations 

  

we lease office facilities and certain equipment under operating leases that expire at various dates through 2014 including an operating lease agreement related to our headquarters office in needham massachusetts entered into in 2000 which expires in december 2012 subject to certain renewal rights these leases qualify for operating lease accounting treatment and as such are not included on our balance sheet at september 30 2006 our contractual obligations including future minimum lease payments net of sublease income under noncancellable operating leases are as follows 

  

      

as of september 30 2006 we had letters of credit and bank guarantees outstanding of approximately 56 million primarily related to the lease of our headquarters in needham massachusetts 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

we have not created and are not party to any specialpurpose or offbalance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital incurring debt or operating parts of our business that are not consolidated to the extent of our ownership interest therein into our 

  

financial statements we have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby we have subordinated retained interests derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks contingent liabilities or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing liquidity market risk or credit risk support to us 

  

new accounting pronouncements 

  

in accordance with recently issued accounting pronouncements we will be required to comply with certain changes in accounting rules and regulations 

  

employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 

  

in september 2006 the fasb issued statement no 158 employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans—an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r sfas 158 for fiscal years ending after december 15 2006 sfas 158 requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan other than a multiemployer plan generally measured as the difference between plan assets at fair value and the projected benefit obligation as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income sfas 158 also generally requires an employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its yearend statement of financial position in addition sfas 158 requires disclosure in the notes to financial statements of additional information about certain effects on net periodic benefit cost for the next fiscal year that arise from delayed recognition of the gains or losses prior service costs or credits and transition assets or obligations upon initial application of sfas 158 and subsequently an employer should continue to apply the provisions in sfas 87 88 and 106 in measuring plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of its statement of financial position and in determining the amount of net periodic benefit cost as our significant defined benefit pension plans are frozen and the accumulated benefit obligation equals the projected benefit obligation we have already recorded in other longterm liabilities and accumulated other comprehensive income the minimum pension liability as such we do not expect the adoption of sfas 158 will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 

  

accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 

  

in july 2006 the fasb issued interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes—an interpretation of fasb statement no 109 fin 48 fin 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with sfas 109 accounting for income taxes fin 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return fin 48 also provides guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods and disclosure relative to uncertain tax positions fin 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 with early adoption encouraged we will adopt fin 48 in fiscal 2008 we are currently evaluating whether or not the adoption of fin 48 will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

  

accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments 

  

in february 2006 the fasb issued statement no 155 accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments—an amendment of fasb statements no 133 and 140 sfas 155 this standard permits fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation clarifies which interestonly strips and principalonly strips are not subject to the requirements of sfas 133 requires evaluation of interests in securitized financial assets clarifies that concentrations of credit risk in the form of subordination are not embedded derivatives and eliminates the prohibition on a qualifying specialpurpose entity from holding a derivative financial instrument that pertains to a beneficial interest other than another derivative financial instrument this standard is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after fiscal years beginning after september 15 2006 we do not believe that adoption of sfas 155 will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 

  

fair value measurements 

  

in september 2006 the fasb issued statement no 157 fair value measurements sfas 157 this statement defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements this statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements the fasb having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute accordingly this statement does not require any new fair value measurements this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years we do not believe the adoption of sfas 157 in fiscal 2009 will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 

  

quantifying financial statement misstatements 

  

in september 2006 the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 108 sab 108 regarding the process of quantifying financial statement misstatements sab 108 states that registrants should use both a balance sheet approach and an income statement approach when quantifying and evaluating materiality of a misstatement the interpretations in sab 108 contain guidance on correcting errors under the dual approach as well as provide transition guidance for correcting errors this interpretation does not change the requirements within sfas 154 accounting changes and error corrections  for the correction of an error in financial statements sab 108 is effective for annual financial statements covering the first fiscal year ending after november 15 2006 we will adopt sab 108 in fiscal 2007 and will determine the impact if a misstatement occurs 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

we face exposure to financial market risks including adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 

  

foreign currency exchange risk 

  

our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to western european countries and japan we enter into various hedging transactions to manage this risk we do not enter into or hold foreign currency derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

  

our nonus revenues generally are transacted through our nonus subsidiaries and typically are denominated in their local currency in addition our nonus expenses that are incurred by our nonus subsidiaries typically are denominated in their local currency approximately 58 62 and 65 of our total revenue was from sales to customers outside of north america in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively approximately 42 45 and 45 of our total expenses were incurred by our subsidiaries domiciled outside of north america in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively 

  

our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations arises in part from intercompany transactions with most intercompany transactions occurring between a us dollar functional currency entity and a foreign currency denominated entity intercompany transactions typically are denominated in the local currency of the nonus subsidiary in order to centralize foreign currency risk also both ptc the parent company and our nonus subsidiaries may transact business with our customers and vendors in a currency other than their functional currency transaction risk in addition we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results and balances of our nonus subsidiaries are translated into us dollars translation risk if sales to customers outside of the united states increase our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates could increase 

  

our foreign currency risk management strategy is principally designed to mitigate the future potential financial impact of changes in the value of transactions and balances denominated in foreign currency resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates our foreign currency hedging program uses forward contracts to manage the foreign currency exposures that exist as part of our ongoing business operations the contracts primarily are denominated in european currencies and japanese yen and have maturities of less than three months 

  

generally we do not designate foreign currency forward contracts as hedges for accounting purposes and changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized immediately in earnings because we enter into forward contracts only as an economic hedge any gain or loss on the underlying foreigndenominated balance would be offset by the loss or gain on the forward contract gains and losses on forward contracts and foreign denominated receivables and payables are included in other income expense net as of september 30 2006 and 2005 we had outstanding forward contracts with notional amounts equivalent to approximately 948 million 326 million in euros 278 million in british pounds 207 million in japanese yen 54 million in korean won and 83 million in other currencies and 567 million 183 million in euros 155 million in british pounds 65 million in japanese yen 50 million in korean won and 114 million in other currencies respectively 

  

we periodically use foreign currency option contracts to hedge specific forecasted net cash flow transactions that are derived from anticipated nonus revenue foreign currency option contracts are designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes and changes in the fair value of the option contract are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings when the underlying forecasted transaction impacts earnings as of september 30 2006 and 2005 there were no foreign currency option contracts outstanding 

  

cash and cash equivalents 

  

as of september 30 2006 cash equivalents were invested in highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased we invest our cash with highly rated financial institutions in north america europe and asiapacific and in diversified domestic and international money market mutual funds at september 30 2006 we had 703 million 753 million 271 million and 107 million of cash and cash equivalents in the united states europe japan and other nonus countries principally in asiapacific respectively given the short maturities and investment grade quality of the portfolio holdings at september 30 2006 a hypothetical 10 change in interest rates would not materially affect the fair value of our cash and cash equivalents 

  

our invested cash is subject to interest rate and for nonus operations foreign currency risk in a declining interest rate environment we would experience a decrease in interest income the opposite holds true in a rising interest rate environment over the past several years the us federal reserve board european central bank and bank of england have changed certain benchmark interest rates which have led to declines and increases in market interest rates these changes in market interest rates have resulted in fluctuations in interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents interest income will continue to fluctuate based on changes in market interest rates and levels of cash available for investment our consolidated cash balances were impacted favorably in 2006 and unfavorably in 2005 by the strengthening and weakening respectively of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar particularly with respect to the euro and the japanese yen

effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures 

  

our management under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer our principal executive officer and principal financial officer respectively has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended as of the end of the period covered by this report based on this evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec rules and forms and that information is accumulated and communicated to our management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures 

  

management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting 

  

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f of the exchange act as a process designed by or under the supervision of our principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by our board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that 

  

   

   

   

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of september 30 2006 using the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal controlintegrated framework  management excluded mathsoft corporate holdings inc mathsoft from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of september 30 2006 because it was acquired by us in a purchase business combination during the third quarter of 2006 mathsoft is a wholly owned subsidiary whose total assets and total revenues each represented less than 2 of our related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended september 30 2006 

  

based on this assessment and those criteria our management concluded that as of september 30 2006 our internal control over financial reporting was effective 

  

our management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of september 30 2006 has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which appears under item 8 

  

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

  

there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act that occurred during the quarter ended september 30 2006 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

the plm market encompasses the mechanical computeraided design manufacturing and engineering cad cam and cae market and the collaboration and data management solutions market as well as many previously isolated markets that address various other phases of the product lifecycle these include product data management pdm component and supplier management visualization and digital mockup enterprise application integration program and project management after market service and portfolio management requirements management customer needs management manufacturing planning and technical and marketing publications 

  

the ecm market encompasses companies in multiple verticals and includes technologies for business process management compliance management document management dynamic publishing document archival and retrieval knowledge management records management and web content management within the ecm market ptc focuses its development on a subset of solutions that optimize the development of dynamic publications such as those associated with technical manuals service documents and regulatory and compliance data sets as well as government and financial document publishing and content management 

  

our software solutions include 

  

   

   

these software solutions enable companies to 

  

   

   

   

   

our software solutions historically focused on addressing the design engineering needs of manufacturing companies over time we expanded our software solutions to enable customers to leverage engineering content across an extended enterprise and design chain as part of this process we diversified our product portfolio to include our windchill content and process management 

  

software and our recently acquired arbortext dynamic publishing software our product development system for manufacturing companies which is a combination of all of our solutions proengineer ®  windchill ® and arbortext ®  enables customers to meet a broad set of needs across the product development lifecycle additionally the combination of windchill and the arbortext products will enable us to extend our product development system to address the content management and dynamic publishing needs of companies in vertical markets we previously have not served such as the life sciences publishing government and financial services markets 

  

our plm solutions suite addresses significant challenges that manufacturing companies face in their product and documentation development processes more frequent change heterogeneity of systems regulatory compliance and increased communication inside and outside the manufacturing enterprise to support growing globalization and outsourcing of development activities increasingly transparent supply chains and growing services and maintenance strategies with our plm software solutions suite we provide our manufacturing customers with a product development system that permits individuals—regardless of their roles in the commercialization of a product the computerbased tools they use or their location geographically or in the supply chain—to participate in and impact the product development process across the digital product value chain we have devoted significant resources to our enterprise solutions and their integration with our design software and continue to integrate our products more tightly and make them easier to deploy we believe this will create significant added value for our customers 

  

for customers in the life sciences publishing government and financial services markets our combined windchill and arbortext solutions will enable us to address significant inefficiencies in crossfunctional or complex documentation development processes today most companies use traditional desktop publishing tools that involve a significant amount of manual work to maintain accurate documentation this causes considerable additional work in environments where multiple authors contribute to the development of content content changes frequently multiple organizations within a company have specialized requirements but use similar content or regulatory compliance drives the need for standardization across all information outputs our combination of windchill and arbortext solutions is the only singlevendor offering that fully addresses these problems our product development system for these vertical markets provides customers the ability to create compound documents from reusable content components manage the content and processes to enable teams to work together and configure and publish the information for a variety of uses and audiences in a variety of formats 

  

our solutions are complemented by our experienced services and technical support organizations as well as resellers and other strategic partners our services and technical support organizations provide training consulting implementation and support services to customers worldwide our resellers supplement our direct sales force and provide greater geographic and small account coverage primarily for our design solutions and our strategic partners provide complementary product andor service offerings 

  

acquisitions 

  

we completed four strategic acquisitions in 2004 and 2005 

  

   

our acquisition of arbortext enables us to provide solutions to create manage and dynamically publish information concurrently with the development of related products or services improving timetomarket and quality and reducing cost the acquisition provides us with new opportunities within our existing markets and with increased access to new markets such as life sciences publishing government and financial services based in ann arbor michigan arbortext had approximately 250 employees in offices around the world and generated revenue of approximately 40 million for the twelve months ended june 30 2005 

  

our acquisition of polyplan technologies helps us enable concurrent development of products and related manufacturing process plans we are focusing on providing an easytouse and affordable solution for use by mainstream manufacturing engineers who are not satisfied with the manufacturing process management tools available today we do not expect the polyplan acquisition to contribute revenue in the near term as we work to integrate the technology with our solutions 

  

through our prior business relationship with aptavis technologies we increased our penetration of the footwear and apparel market and our solution for this market that uses the aptavis technology has been adopted by leading footwear and apparel manufacturers and retailers our acquisition of aptavis enables us to more fully integrate the aptavis technology into our product offerings and to further develop the technology to address the requirements of international customers although we expect this business to continue to grow the revenue contribution from the aptavis technology historically has not been material and we do not expect this to change in the near term as a result of this acquisition 

  

our acquisition of ohio design automation enables us to offer the intercomm ™ suite of electronic design collaboration solutions to enable enterprisewide visualization verification annotation and automated comparison of electronic design content these solutions are targeted toward high tech and electronics manufacturers and other manufacturers of products that contain electronic components we offer the intercomm products both as stand alone solutions and as part of the windchill product line 

  

we believe these acquisitions enhance the value and appeal of our product development system by adding capabilities that are valuable to both our existing customers and customers in new vertical industries the new capabilities we are adding enable our customers to create more downstream deliverables such as manufacturing process plans and to address complex documentation requirements such as maintenance instructions operator manuals promotional materials and regulatory filings at the same time these acquisitions provide increased access to new markets where we can offer configurations of our product development system that are targeted to these new markets

product development 

  

for our products to remain competitive we must provide our customers with new and innovative software solutions as a result we continue to spend on research and development and we look for opportunities to acquire new technologies suited to our customers’ needs we must also efficiently manage our development resources to ensure the appropriate balance among product lines based on both product development plans and customer demand 

  

our ability to rapidly develop new design products is facilitated by the modular structure of our software code this structure enables functional capabilities of existing products to be used in new software applications or modules thereby reducing the amount of new code required to develop additional products much of our enterprise solutions technology is internetcentric javabased objectoriented software and our products depend on these evolving technologies we also license certain technologies from third parties to augment the functionality of our products we generally pay these third parties either periodic royalties or fixed fees for the use of their technologies and rely on them for development and other support we continually review the associated costs development resource savings support levels and if applicable experience with the third party to determine whether the use of such technologies is beneficial 

  

over the past few years we have focused much of our research and development investment on integrating our products into a unified product development system this strategy is supported by changes we have made to both our product planning and product testing processes these planning and testing phase changes ensure that the products work together in a cohesive system across specific customer business processes 

  

we also work closely with our customers to define improvements and enhancements to our products customers become involved in the software design process to help validate feasibility and to provide feedback on functionality early in the development of our products in addition we maintain software and hardware partner programs designed to provide partners both with access to our products and with the mechanisms and environment to facilitate the integration of complementary products with our product lines through our open software toolkits program members can build tightly integrated solutions that satisfy the various requirements of our customers

we currently lease 114 offices used in operations in the united states and internationally through our nonus subsidiaries predominately as sales andor support offices and for research and development work of our total of approximately 1136000 square feet of leased facilities used in operations approximately 550000 square feet are located in the us including 316000 square feet of our headquarters facility located in needham massachusetts the lease for our headquarters began in december 2000 and expires in december 2012 subject to certain renewal rights we also lease space comprising approximately 415000 square feet which is not used for our current operations and is primarily subleased to third parties as described in notes b and g of “notes to consolidated financial statements” lease commitments on unused facilities in excess of expected sublease income have been included in our restructuring provisions we continue to engage in subleasing and early lease termination initiatives to employ alternate uses for these excess facilities we believe that our facilities are adequate for our present needs 

  




 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

on may 30 2003 a lawsuit was filed against us in the us district court for the district of massachusetts by rand a technology corporation and rand technologies limited together “rand” rand historically had been our largest distributor the complaint alleges various breaches of a revised oneyear distribution agreement entered into in december 2002 as well as other agreements between rand and us and also asserts certain noncontract claims the complaint as amended seeks equitable relief and substantial damages on november 24 2003 we filed our substantive response to rand’s complaint and asserted counterclaims against rand during the second quarter of 2005 rand quantified its claimed actual damages as being in excess of 50 million and rand asserts that this amount should be trebled by the court as a result of several recent rulings by the court some of rand’s claims have been dismissed and rand’s possible maximum recovery in the lawsuit may have been reduced in addition the court has excluded the testimony of the damages expert hired by rand to substantiate rand’s damages quantification the court has also issued a ruling granting ptc summary judgment on one of ptc’s counterclaims against rand despite these rulings several of rand’s claims as well as certain of our counterclaims remain to be tried before a jury we believe rand’s claims and its damages assessment associated with those claims are without merit and will continue to contest them vigorously we also intend diligently to prosecute our counterclaims we cannot predict the ultimate resolution of this action at this time and we cannot assure you that this action if determined adversely to us will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

  

we also are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business we currently believe that resolving these other matters will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations

executive overview 

  

in 2004 we focused on and achieved a significant turnaround in profitability in 2005 we focused on increasing revenue and profitability with a view towards our longerterm goal of achieving 1 billion in revenue in 2008 as we discuss in detail below for 2005 we achieved 9 yearoveryear revenue growth and net income more than double that of the prior year we achieved these results through organic growth in revenue from our core solutions and through strategic acquisitions 

  

the following graphs for the prior three years illustrate two consecutive years of improved revenue operating income and earnings per share 

  

  

we believe our operating results in 2005 reflect successful execution of our strategic initiatives which focused on improving our product and service offerings our distribution model our competitive position and our marketing message and are also attributable to the results of our restructuring program completed in 2004 revenue increased in both enterprise solutions and desktop solutions primarily due to increased sales of consulting and training and maintenance services we increased sales of our services and solutions through expansion of our services delivery organization and our reseller channel increased adoption of proengineer wildfire and implementation of windchill and the addition of arbortext products our operating expenses were below 2003 levels due to our restructuring program but increased over 2004 due to incremental expenditures we made to support our revenue growth in 2005 and to support anticipated future revenue growth in 2006 we intend to continue to grow revenue and earnings through organic growth of our core solutions and through strategic acquisitions 

  

acquisitions 

  

we completed four acquisitions in 2004 and 2005 that we believe will help accelerate our longterm growth we purchased arbortext inc a provider of enterprise publishing software in the fourth quarter of 2005 polyplan technologies inc a provider of manufacturing process planning technology in the third quarter of 2005 aptavis technologies corporation a provider of windchillbased solutions for the retail footwear and apparel industry in the third quarter of 2005 and ohio design automation inc a provider of electronic design collaboration software in the third quarter of 2004 we believe arbortext will contribute significantly to our planned growth in 2006 as its solutions facilitate timely accurate and productspecific technical publications solving a problem faced by our traditional installed base of discrete manufacturing customers it also provides us entry into vertical markets we previously have not served including the life sciences publishing government and financial services markets as a standalone company arbortext generated revenue of approximately 40 million for the twelve months ended june 30 2005 our acquisitions of polyplan aptavis and ohio design are important because they provide increased access to new markets where we can provide different configurations of our product development system although we do not expect these acquisitions to contribute significant revenue in the near term you can find more information about these acquisitions under the subheading “acquisitions” of the “business” section of this report which begins on page 2 

  

market opportunities 

  

we believe demand for our traditional cadcamcae solutions has begun to grow again modestly and that the broader plm market continues to present an opportunity for more meaningful growth we believe the overall market for plm solutions is evolving as manufacturers seek to improve their total product development processes instead of focusing on individual productivity in engineering or manufacturing these product development processes have become increasingly complex as companies develop and manufacture products across geographic and corporate boundaries a trend referred to as “global product development” 

  

additionally we believe there is a growing opportunity in the small and mediumsized business market as these manufacturers migrate from twodimensional design tools to entrylevel threedimensional design tools we believe these smaller manufacturers have a need for and will invest in collaboration and data management solutions over the next several years 

  

finally we recently entered the ecm market as the result of our acquisition of arbortext we believe potential for significant growth exists in the portion of the ecm market that arbortext addressed as a standalone solution in addition we believe we have an incremental opportunity to sell our windchill solutions into vertical markets beyond our core manufacturing base as a result of the combination of windchill and arbortext into a dynamic publishing and related content management solution 

  

fiscal year 2006 

  

in support of our goal to increase revenue and earnings in 2006 while remaining focused on profitability we plan to continue 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

our success will depend on among other factors our ability to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

we discuss additional factors affecting our revenue and operating results under important factors that may affect future results beginning on page 31 

  

results of operations 

  

overview 

  

the following is a summary of our results of operations for the last three years which includes the results of operations of companies we acquired beginning on their acquisition date a detailed discussion of these results follows the table below 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

the following table shows certain consolidated financial data as a percentage of our total revenue for the last three years 

  

   

revenue 

  

our revenue consists of software license revenue and service revenue which includes software maintenance as well as consulting implementation training and other technical support revenue 

  

we report our revenue in two product categories 

  

   

   

we previously reported our revenue in the following two categories design solutions and collaboration and control solutions in the fourth quarter of 2005 as a result of the arbortext acquisition we redefined our product categories this redefinition required no reclassifications of prior reported revenues between our two product categories revenue historically reported as design solutions is now reported as desktop solutions and revenue historically reported as collaboration and control solutions is now reported as enterprise solutions 

  

we recently launched prointralink 80 which is based on our windchill technology our prior prointralink product was not windchillbased and was either used as a standalone product or together with windchill in previous periods half of prointralink revenue was allocated to design solutions and half was allocated to collaboration and control solutions as a result of the new technology configuration of prointralink 80 beginning in the fourth quarter of 2005 all prointralink revenue is fully classified as enterprise solutions 

  

total revenue 

  

the following table illustrates trends from 2003 to 2005 in our software license and in our service revenues as well as by product category and geography 

  

    

in 2005 we had yearoveryear revenue growth in both desktop solutions and enterprise solutions this growth reflects increases in consulting and training services and in maintenance as well as an increase in the number of new seats sold in both product categories we attribute this growth to execution of our strategic initiatives described above as well as increased technology spending by our customers particularly in north america the improvements reflect both organic growth as well as revenue from sales of newly acquired products particularly arbortext products historically arbortext generated revenue for the twelve months ended june 30 2005 of approximately 40 million which is not included in our results for 2005 since the acquisition date july 19 2005 arbortext has been included in our 2005 results of operations license revenue accounted for 29 30 and 31 of total revenue in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively while consulting and training service revenue which has a lower gross profit margin accounted for 23 21 and 23 of total revenue in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively we enter into customer contracts that may result in revenue being recognized over multiple reporting periods license andor consulting and training services revenue of 1 million or more within a quarter recognized from such contracts was 851 million 770 million and 715 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively increases in consulting and training services revenue are due primarily to the emphasis we have placed on providing customers with process consulting training and adoption services that help customers improve their product development processes and adoption of our solutions as we have increased our service revenues and expanded our service product offerings including computerbased training products that have a higher margin than other service products we have also improved our service margins an important part of our overall strategy maintenance revenue represented 48 49 and 46 of total revenues in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively 

  

we attribute the total revenue declines from 2003 to 2004 to a number of factors including the relative saturation and increased competitiveness of the north american and european markets for design solutions economic factors resulting in reluctance of our customers to consummate large software purchases our reduced delivery capacity caused by headcount reductions in our services business the weakness in technology spending in the global manufacturing economy during that period and the relative infancy of the plm market the increase in maintenance revenue in 2004 over 2003 was primarily attributable to customers’ adoption of proengineer wildfire and prior period growth in windchillbased solutions license revenue 

  

we derived 62 65 and 63 of our total revenue from sales to customers outside of north america in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively we believe the improvements in our 2005 revenue in north america are attributable to implementation of our strategic initiatives and also indicate that the economy in that region where the manufacturing sector and related technology spending had been weak over the past several years improved over 2004 in addition to our organic growth in north america the acquisition of arbortext whose revenues were concentrated in that region also contributed to our growth there the increase in european revenue in 2005 compared to 2004 is due primarily to improving sales and services performance in strategic accounts and favorable foreign currency exchange as noted above revenue performance in asiapacific in 2005 compared to 2004 reflects a 12 increase in revenues in the pacific rim partially offset by a 1 decrease in revenues in japan japan experienced a decline in license revenue from large deals partially offset by an increase in consulting and training revenue we believe the asiapacific region continues to present an important growth opportunity because global manufacturing companies have continued to invest in that region and the market in that region for both our desktop solutions and enterprise solutions is relatively unsaturated 

  

we have been building and diversifying our reseller channel to become less dependent on a small number of resellers and to provide the resources necessary for more effective distribution of our products although we typically receive lower revenue per seat for an indirect sale versus a direct sale we believe that using diverse and geographically dispersed resellers that focus on smaller businesses provides an efficient and cost effective means to reach these customers and allows our direct sales force to focus on larger sales opportunities total sales from our reseller channel which are primarily for our cadcamcae design solutions were 1386 million 19 of total revenue in 2005 1359 million 21 of total revenue in 2004 and 1060 million 16 of total revenue in 2003 we attribute this performance to our efforts to expand our reseller channel and to the success of proengineer wildfire among small and mediumsized businesses as proengineer wildfire has become increasingly competitive in this market both relative to our historic offerings as well as to competitive offerings in this market segment we continue to see growth in reseller channel revenue in north america and europe while reseller channel performance in asiapacific was not as strong as in our other regions in 2005 we recently made organizational and infrastructure changes to our reseller channel in that region that we expect will result in higher revenue growth in asiapacific in 2006 

  

enterprise solutions revenue 

  

the following table illustrates trends from 2003 to 2005 in our enterprise solutions software license revenue and service revenue 

  

   

total revenue from our enterprise solutions software and related services was 30 27 and 26 of our total revenue in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively 

  

the increase in enterprise solutions revenue in 2005 compared to 2004 was due to 

  

   

   

   

   

enterprise solutions license revenue grew 19 and 3 in 2005 and 2004 respectively compared to the previous periods the number of new windchill seats added during the year was 42 higher in 2005 than in 2004 compared to a decline of 12 in 2004 from 2003 increases in our enterprise solutions maintenance revenue and consulting and training service revenue are due primarily to an increase in the number of new users of our enterprise solutions as new customers are added and existing customers expand their implementation to additional users the increase in 2005 reflects organic growth as well as growth from the acquisition of arbortext consulting and training service revenue growth is also attributable to our focus on new process consulting offerings consulting and training service revenues in 2004 were adversely affected by our reduced services delivery capacity due to our 2004 headcount reductions 

  

we believe our success in growing enterprise solutions revenue is attributable in large part to our targeted windchillbased solutions including our windchill link solutions and related services packages these solutions can be implemented in incremental fashion in accordance with our product development system adoption roadmap which provides customers with a suggested approach for purchasing and implementing our solutions in stages and reduce customers’ initial required investments 

  

we believe we can increase our enterprise solutions revenue by improving our ability to sell enterprise solutions to small and mediumsized businesses to achieve this we are expanding our distribution of plm solutions by offering qualified resellers the ability to sell our windchill link solutions as well as related services in addition during 2005 we began to offer on demand versions of several windchill link solutions that help minimize customers’ cost of ownership and reduce implementation time we describe these on demand solutions under “item 1 business – our principal products and services – enterprise solutions” beginning on page 4 the revenue contribution from these initiatives was not material in 2005 

  

desktop solutions revenue 

  

the following table illustrates trends from 2003 to 2005 in our desktop solutions software license revenue and service revenue 

  

   

total revenue from our desktop solutions and related services was 70 73 and 74 of our total revenue in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively the yearoveryear decline in license revenue in 2005 and 2004 was primarily due to lower revenue from highend packages particularly from large deals in japan in 2004 not replicated in 2005 despite lower revenue from highend packages sales of our lowend and midrange packages within our installed base and to new customers increased and we experienced a 12 increase in the total number of new proengineer seats added during each of 2005 and 2004 compared to new seats added in the previous periods we believe such sales provide the foundation for longterm relationships and repeat business as well as for potential sales of services and our overall product development system within these accounts increases in our desktop solutions maintenance and consulting and training revenue are due primarily to the increase in new seats over the past two years and improvements in our renewal rates we believe these trends are a reflection of further customer adoption of proengineer wildfire the increase in desktop solutions consulting and training service revenue is also due to higher revenue from sales of consulting services and training packages including computerbased training products that help our customers improve user proficiency and engineering productivity the decrease in desktop solutions total service revenue in 2004 was due in large part to license revenue declines in prior periods as well as our reduced services delivery capacity caused by our 2004 headcount reductions 

  

we believe that our decision to offer proengineer packages with differing price points and functionality will continue to contribute to adoption of these solutions we designed these packages to address our customers’ purchasing patterns and to better compete in the small and mediumsized business segment of our market because our low and highend offerings are based on the same architecture our solutions are scalable between different types of users or as customer needs grow which differentiates our products from others in the marketplace our desktop solutions are now more competitive with lowerend modeling tools on the market that are known for ease of use while maintaining the functionality for which proengineer is known 

  

despite recent signs of improvement desktop solutions revenue continues to be adversely affected by the relative maturity and saturation of the north american and european cadcamcae markets the difficulty associated with displacing incumbent product design systems in the discrete market for computeraided design solutions and increased competition and price pressure from products offering more limited functionality at lower cost however despite declines in 2005 desktop solutions revenue in japan compared to the comparable prior period we believe the asiapacific region continues to present an opportunity for growth because the market is relatively unsaturated the number of mechanical engineers is growing and companies are continuing to migrate from twodimensional to threedimensional design tools to address this we have made recent organizational and infrastructure changes in our reseller channel in that region that we expect will result in higher revenue growth in asiapacific in 2006 

  

costs and expenses 

  

over the past several years we have made significant investments necessary to transform our business from providing a single line of technical software with a largely direct distribution model supplemented by a small number of channel partners to providing a family of enterprise solutions with an expanded channel and partnerinvolved distribution model in 2003 after completing a significant portion of this transformation we implemented a restructuring plan to reduce our cost structure which we completed in the fourth quarter of 2004 all cost and expense categories in 2004 and 2003 were impacted by restructuring actions taken in those periods the following table illustrates trends from 2003 to 2005 in our costs and expenses 

  

    

as described in note a of “notes to consolidated financial statements” effective july 3 2005 we adopted sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” accordingly for the three months ended september 30 2005 stockbased compensation was accounted for under sfas no 123r which requires the expensing of the fair value of stockbased awards in our consolidated statement of operations while for the nine months ended july 2 2005 and for 2004 and 2003 stockbased compensation was accounted for under apb no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” which required only the expensing of the intrinsic value of stockbased awards in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 we granted to our employees directors and officers an aggregate of 1928000 shares of restricted stock 809000 shares of which were performancebased awards that could be earned in whole or in part subject to further timebased vesting upon achievement of 2005 performance criteria and 3390007 restricted stock units each of which represents the right to receive one share of our common stock also in the fourth quarter of 2005 we offered eligible 

  

employees the opportunity to exchange eligible stock options for a cash payment employees holding approximately 183 million eligible stock options elected to participate in the stock option exchange accounting for the stock option exchange was recorded in our consolidated financial statements in the fourth quarter of 2005 the aggregate amount of the cash payments made to employees in exchange for their eligible options was 127 million and was paid in the fourth quarter of the total cash payments made in connection with the stock option exchange 05 million was recorded as compensation expense and 122 million was recorded as a charge to stockholders’ equity in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 123r the amounts in the table above include stockbased compensation expense from our stockbased awards and completing the stock option exchange as follows 

  

   

  

total costs and expenses increased to 6349 million in 2005 compared to 6226 million in 2004 headcount increased to 3751 at the end of 2005 from 3042 at the end of 2004 our increase in costs and expenses including headcount was primarily due to the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

 these increases were partially offset by a decrease in restructuring and other charges 

  

we anticipate that we will make additional measured increases to operating expenses to support our base business and to fund the revenuegenerating initiatives described above and in executive overview beginning on page 10 

  

total costs and expenses decreased to 6226 million in 2004 compared to 7516 million in 2003 primarily as a result of our restructuring plan initiated in 2003 and completed in the fourth quarter of 2004 in 2004 to achieve our objective of restoring profitability we implemented cost cutting measures that reduced our headcount resulting in lower aggregate salaries benefits and related costs as a result our headcount decreased to 3042 at the end of 2004 from 3500 at the end of 2003 in addition our cost reduction initiatives resulted in reduced facility charges including rent and related overhead costs primarily as a result of headcount reductions and lease costs related to excess facilities we recorded restructuring and other charges of 429 million and 309 million in 2004 and 2003 respectively see restructuring and other charges credits below and note b of “notes to consolidated financial statements” for further discussion 

  

cost of license revenue 

  

our cost of license revenue consists of fixed and variable costs associated with reproducing and distributing software and documentation as well as royalties paid to third parties for technology embedded in or licensed with our software products cost of license revenue as a percentage of license revenue was 4 for 2005 and 2004 and 5 for 2003 this ratio varies depending on the product mix sold and the effect of fixed and variable royalties in relation to the level of license revenue the decrease in cost of license revenue in 2004 compared to 2003 was primarily due to lower royalty costs of approximately 22 million in 2004 resulting primarily from lower revenue cost of license revenue in 2005 includes amortization of purchased software from our recent acquisitions totaling 06 million compared with none in 2004 and 2003 we expect amortization of purchased software from our completed acquisitions to total approximately 31 million in 2006 

  

cost of service revenue 

  

our cost of service revenue includes costs associated with training customer support and consulting personnel such as salaries and related costs thirdparty subcontractor fees costs associated with the release of maintenance updates including related royalty costs and facility costs cost of service revenue as a percentage of service revenue was 39 in 2005 38 in 2004 and 44 in 2003 service related employee headcount increased 28 at the end of 2005 after a decrease of 17 at the end of 2004 each compared to the prior year at the end of 2005 2004 and 2003 services headcount was 1019 797 and 955 respectively total salaries commissions benefits and travel costs were higher by an aggregate of approximately 140 million including 26 million related to the change in accounting for stockbased compensation described above in 2005 compared to 2004 these costs were higher due to planned increases including by acquisition in our services delivery capacity and higher commissions due to the increase in service revenue partially offset by reductions in employee benefit costs primarily medical and costs related to employees on global assignments the cost of thirdparty consulting services was 82 million higher in 2005 compared to 2004 due to the use of such services in support of increases in training and professional services revenue royalty costs were 35 million higher in 2005 compared to 2004 due primarily to the 50 million onetime benefit recorded in 2004 described below the decreased cost of service revenue in 2004 compared to 2003 was due to the reduction in employee headcount in our services organization at the end of 2004 as compared to the end of 2003 resulting in a 169 million reduction in compensation benefit and travel costs in addition royalty costs were 115 million lower in 2004 than in 2003 primarily as a result of a contract renegotiation finalized in the second quarter of 2004 resulting in a onetime benefit of 50 million from the reversal of an accrual established in the fourth quarter of 2003 

  

sales and marketing 

  

our sales and marketing expenses primarily include salaries and benefits sales commissions advertising and marketing programs travel and facility costs sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenue were 34 in 2005 and 2004 and 44 in 2003 total sales and marketing employee headcount increased 15 at the end of 2005 and decreased 15 at the end of 2004 compared to the prior year at the end of 2005 2004 and 2003 sales and marketing headcount was 1087 945 and 1114 respectively total salaries commissions benefits and travel costs were higher by an aggregate of approximately 234 million including 51 million related to the change in accounting for stockbased compensation described above in 2005 compared to 2004 these costs were higher in 2005 due to planned increases including by acquisition in headcount and higher commissions due primarily to changes to our commission structure and to increased license and service revenue these costs were partially offset by lower costs related to fewer employees on global assignments in addition marketing program costs were 27 million higher in 2005 compared to 2004 these cost increases were partially offset by a 50 million decrease in depreciation rent telephone and office support costs due to facility closures and consolidations compared to 2003 total sales and marketing expenses decreased 24 in 2004 primarily as a result of headcount reductions as well as reductions in marketing program costs which were 84 million lower in 2004 

  

research and development 

  

our research and development expenses consist principally of salaries and benefits costs of computer equipment and facility expenses we released a new version of windchill in the third quarter of 2005 and we are scheduled to release the next version of proengineer wildfire in the spring of 2006 research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenue were 16 in 

  

2005 and 2004 and 19 in 2003 research and development headcount increased 28 at the end of 2005 and decreased 16 at the end of 2004 compared to the prior year at the end of 2005 2004 and 2003 research and development headcount was 1242 971 and 1083 respectively total salaries benefits and travel costs were higher in 2005 compared to 2004 by an aggregate of approximately 112 million including 38 million related to the change in accounting for stockbased compensation described above in addition the cost of thirdparty development services was higher by 30 million the decrease in expenses in 2004 compared to 2003 was due primarily to shifting certain development activities to our existing facilities in india where overall research and development costs are lower to lower depreciation and telecommunication costs and to cost reductions from our restructuring plan completed in 2004 which resulted in lower headcount at the end of 2004 compared to the end of 2003 

  

general and administrative 

  

our general and administrative expenses include the costs of our corporate finance information technology human resources legal and administrative functions as well as bad debt expense general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue were 9 in 2005 and 2004 and 10 in 2003 general and administrative headcount increased by 23 at the end of 2005 after a decrease of 7 at the end of 2004 compared to the prior year at the end of 2005 2004 and 2003 general and administrative headcount was 385 314 and 336 respectively total salaries benefits and travel costs were higher in 2005 compared to 2004 by an aggregate of approximately 69 million including 39 million related to the change in accounting for stockbased compensation described above in addition the cost of outside professional services increased by 35 million primarily related to corporate development initiatives and sarbanesoxley compliance these increases were partially offset by a 41 million reduction in depreciation rent office support and insurance costs and a 15 million decrease in bad debt expense the decrease in expenses in 2004 compared to 2003 was primarily due to a reduction in headcount as well as lower depreciation bad debt expense and insurance costs the decreases were partially offset by an increase in compensation expense associated with incentive plan bonuses for which targets were met in 2004 bad debt expense in 2005 2004 and 2003 was 16 million 31 million and 51 million respectively we attribute these decreases in bad debt expense to improved credit risk management and improving economic conditions 

  

amortization of acquired intangible assets 

  

the amortization of acquired intangible assets line item on the statement of operations represents the amortization of nonproduct related intangible assets from acquisitions amortization of these acquisitionrelated intangibles which totaled 16 million 52 million and 59 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively primarily relates to the amortization of customerrelated intangibles the decrease in 2005 compared to 2004 was due to certain intangible assets being fully amortized in 2004 partially offset by amortization of intangible assets resulting from our acquisitions in 2004 and 2005 we expect amortization of nonproduct related intangible assets from our completed acquisitions to total approximately 46 million in 2006 

  

our acquisition of arbortext in the fourth quarter of 2005 resulted in an increase in intangible assets and goodwill of 1967 million including 353 million of customer lists 105 million of purchased software 08 million of trademarks which are being amortized over estimated useful lives of 10 years 35 years and 5 years respectively and 1501 million of goodwill 

  

our acquisitions of polyplan technologies inc and aptavis technologies corporation in the third quarter of 2005 resulted in an increase in intangible assets and goodwill of 89 million including 33 million in other intangible assets primarily comprised of purchased software which is being amortized over 3 years and 56 million of goodwill 

  

our acquisition of ohio design automation inc in the third quarter of 2004 resulted in an increase in intangible assets and goodwill of 104 million including 18 million for customer lists and 16 million for purchased software which are being amortized over estimated useful lives of 5 years and 3 years respectively and 70 million of goodwill 

  

inprocess research and development 

  

purchased inprocess research and development of 07 million was writtenoff in the fourth quarter of 2005 and relates to two arbortext projects under development for which technological feasibility had not yet been established at the acquisition date and for which there was no alternative future use the value of the purchased inprocess research and development was determined 

  

using the residual income approach which discounts expected future cash flows from projects under development to their net present value these development projects are expected to be completed by the third quarter of 2006 and the expected cost to complete was approximately 2 million as of the acquisition date 

  

restructuring and other charges credits 

  

in 2005 2004 and 2003 we recorded restructuring and other charges credits of 13 million 429 million and 309 million respectively primarily associated with reductions in workforce and excess facility obligations to reduce our cost structure and to improve profitability during those same periods we made cash payments related to restructuring and other charges including payments relating to restructuring and other charges recorded prior to 2003 of 108 million 406 million and 244 million respectively amounts not yet paid at september 30 2005 related to restructuring and other charges taken during the current and all prior periods were 344 million including 29 million recorded in connection with our acquisition of arbortext and primarily relate to excess facility obligations to be paid out through 2014 of the total amount accrued at september 30 2005 we expect to make cash disbursements within the next twelve months estimated at 11 million for restructuring charges incurred in 2005 and prior periods and 3 million for costs associated with the execution of our arbortext integration plan 

  

in the fourth quarter of 2005 we recorded a net credit to restructuring and other charges of 13 million the restructuring credit includes a 30 million credit for changes in our estimated liabilities for facilities that we vacated offset by 17 million of severance and termination costs related to nine employees terminated during the period the 30 million credit is due primarily to reoccupying in the fourth quarter of 2005 a portion of our headquarters facility that was previously vacated and included in restructuring costs in a prior period the space was available for sublease and was being marketed but was reoccupied due to space requirements related to our three acquisitions completed in 2005 and general business growth as of september 30 2005 substantially all of our remaining headquarters excess space has been sublet 

  

in 2004 we recorded restructuring and other charges of 210 million for severance and termination benefits related to 459 employees terminated during 2004 and 219 million related primarily to excess facilities the charges for excess facilities were primarily related to gross lease commitments in excess of estimated sublease income for excess facilities of the total restructuring and other charges recorded in 2004 19 million was noncash for the writeoff of leasehold improvements related to the excess facilities we completed the restructuring program in the fourth quarter of 2004 

  

in 2003 we recorded restructuring charges of 179 million for severance and termination benefits related to 361 employees terminated during 2003 we also recorded charges of 116 million related to excess facilities and 14 million of other costs primarily related to the writeoff of acquired technology the increases in the liability for excess facilities in 2003 related primarily to revised estimates of gross lease commitments in excess of expected sublease income for leases assumed in our 1998 acquisition of computervision corporation as well as to consolidation of existing leased facilities 

  

interest income 

  

interest income relates to earnings on the investment of our available cash balances and totaled 69 million 35 million and 33 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively the increase in 2005 is related primarily to higher average cash balances and interest rates we expect this amount to be lower in 2006 due to the fact that we used 1989 million of cash to acquire arbortext and other businesses in the second half of 2005 the modest increase in interest income in 2004 compared to 2003 was due to higher average cash balances partially offset by lower interest rates 

  

other expense net 

  

other expense net includes costs of hedging contracts certain realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains or losses charges incurred in connection with financing customer contracts writedowns of investments and foreign exchange gains or losses resulting from the required periodend currency remeasurement of the financial statements of our subsidiaries that use the us dollar as their functional currency a large portion of our revenue and expenses is transacted in foreign currencies to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates we engage in hedging transactions involving the use of foreign currency forward contracts primarily in western european and asian currencies other expense net totaled 14 million 39 million and 

  

61 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively the decreases in other expense net in 2005 and 2004 compared to the prior years were due primarily to lower charges in connection with financing customer contracts which were 08 million in 2005 21 million in 2004 and 39 million in 2003 

  

income taxes 

  

our effective tax rate was 8 on pretax income of 913 million in 2005 6 on pretax income of 370 million in 2004 and 19 on a pretax loss of 824 million in 2003 the difference between the statutory federal income tax rate of 35 and the effective tax rate of 8 in 2005 was primarily due to a tax benefit of 121 million arising from the reduction of our tax liabilities upon the favorable resolution of tax audits in a foreign jurisdiction and to taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions with a lower effective tax rate partially offset by us operating losses that could not be benefited the difference between the statutory federal income tax rate of 35 and the effective tax rate of 6 in 2004 was due primarily to an 189 million onetime tax benefit related to a us federal income tax refund described below partially offset by us operating losses that could not be benefited and to taxes payable in certain foreign jurisdictions the difference between the statutory federal income tax rate of 35 and the effective tax rate provision of 19 in 2003 was due primarily to us operating losses that could not be benefited and to taxes payable in certain foreign jurisdictions as a result of operating losses incurred in recent years and uncertainty as to the extent and timing of profitability in future periods in 2002 we increased our valuation allowance for our remaining net deferred tax assets by approximately 480 million through the provision for income taxes due to the uncertainty regarding the realizability of deferred tax assets see critical accounting policies below and note f of “notes to consolidated financial statements” in 2005 2004 and 2003 we maintained our full valuation allowance for deferred tax assets in the us primarily related to operating loss carryforwards and in certain other foreign jurisdictions 

  

in the normal course of business ptc and its subsidiaries are examined by various taxing authorities including the internal revenue service irs in the united states in 2005 we recorded tax benefits of 121 million arising from the reduction of our tax liabilities upon the favorable resolution of foreign jurisdiction tax audits in fiscal 2004 the irs concluded its examination of our income tax returns for fiscal years 1998 through 2000 resulting in a tax refund including interest to us of 395 million we received notice of the refund amount in the fourth quarter of 2004 and we received the refund in the first quarter of 2005 the refund resulted in a nonrecurring tax benefit of 189 million in 2004 at september 30 2004 income taxes receivable included expected refunds of us federal income taxes and related interest totaling 395 million respectively 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

we have prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america in preparing our financial statements we make estimates assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our reported revenues results from operations and net income loss as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet these estimates assumptions and judgments about future events and their effects on our results cannot be determined with certainty and are made based on our historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances these estimates may change as new events occur or additional information is obtained and we may periodically be faced with uncertainties the outcomes of which are not within our control and may not be known for a prolonged period of time 

  

while there are a number of accounting policies methods and estimates affecting our financial statements described in note a of notes to consolidated financial statements  the areas that are our most important critical accounting policies and estimates are described below and include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

a critical accounting policy is one that is both material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires us to make difficult subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate and different estimates that we could have used or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process actual results could differ from those estimates 

  

accounting policies guidelines and interpretations related to our critical accounting policies and estimates are generally subject to numerous sources of authoritative guidance and are often reexamined by accounting standards rule makers and regulators these rule makers andor regulators may promulgate interpretations guidance or regulations that may result in changes to our accounting policies which could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 

  

revenue recognition 

  

while we apply the guidance of statement of position sop no 972 software revenue recognition and statement of position no 989 modification of sop 972 software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions both issued by the american institute of certified public accountants as well as sec staff accounting bulletin 104 revenue recognition we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amounts of software license and services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period our primary judgments involve the following 

  

   

   

   

   

we derive revenues from three primary sources 1 software licenses 2 maintenance services and 3 consulting and training services revenue by type for 2005 2004 and 2003 is as follows 

  

   

for software license arrangements that do not require significant modification or customization of the underlying software we recognize revenue when 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 2 delivery has occurred generally fob shipping point or electronic distribution 3 the fee is fixed or determinable and 4 collection is probable substantially all of our license revenues are recognized in this manner 

  

our software is distributed primarily through our direct sales force in addition we have an indirect distribution channel through alliances with resellers revenue arrangements with resellers are recognized on a sellthrough basis that is when we receive 

  

persuasive evidence that the reseller has sold the products to an enduser customer we do not offer contractual rights of return stock balancing or price protection to our resellers and actual product returns from them have been insignificant to date as a result we do not maintain reserves for product returns and related allowances 

  

at the time of each sale transaction we must make an assessment of the collectibility of the amount due from the customer revenue is only recognized at that time if management deems that collection is probable in making this assessment we consider customer creditworthiness and historical payment experience at that same time we assess whether fees are fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties if the fee is not fixed or determinable revenue is recognized only as payments become due from the customer provided that all other revenue recognition criteria are met in assessing whether the fee is fixed or determinable we consider the payment terms of the transaction and our collection experience in similar transactions without making concessions among other factors our software license arrangements generally do not include customer acceptance provisions however if an arrangement includes an acceptance provision we record revenue only upon the earlier of 1 receipt of written acceptance from the customer or 2 expiration of the acceptance period 

  

our software arrangements often include implementation and consulting services that are sold separately under consulting engagement contracts or as part of the software license arrangement when we determine that such services are not essential to the functionality of the licensed software and qualify as “service transactions” under sop 972 we record revenue separately for the license and service elements of these arrangements generally we consider that a service is not essential to the functionality of the software based on various factors including if the services may be provided by independent third parties experienced in providing such consulting and implementation in coordination with dedicated customer personnel if an arrangement does not qualify for separate accounting of the license and service elements then license revenue is recognized together with the consulting services using either the percentageofcompletion or completedcontract method of contract accounting contract accounting is also applied to any software arrangements that include customerspecific acceptance criteria or where the license payment is tied to the performance of consulting services under the percentageofcompletion method we estimate the stage of completion of contracts with fixed or “not to exceed” fees based on hours or costs incurred to date as compared with estimated total project hours or costs at completion if we do not have a sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion revenue is recognized upon completion of the contract when total cost estimates exceed revenues we accrue for the estimated losses immediately the use of the percentageofcompletion method of accounting requires significant judgment relative to estimating total contract costs including assumptions relative to the length of time to complete the project the nature and complexity of the work to be performed and anticipated changes in salaries and other costs when adjustments in estimated contract costs are determined such revisions may have the effect of adjusting in the current period the earnings applicable to performance in prior periods 

  

we generally use the residual method to recognize revenues from arrangements that include one or more elements to be delivered at a future date when evidence of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists under the residual method the fair value of the undelivered elements eg maintenance consulting and training services based on vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements ie software license if evidence of the fair value of one or more of the undelivered services does not exist all revenues are deferred and recognized when delivery of all of those services has occurred or when fair values can be established we determine vsoe of the fair value of services revenues based upon our recent pricing for those services when sold separately vsoe of the fair value of maintenance services may also be determined based on a substantive maintenance renewal clause if any within a customer contract our current pricing practices are influenced primarily by product type purchase volume maintenance term and customer location we review services revenues sold separately and maintenance renewal rates on a periodic basis and update when appropriate our vsoe of fair value for such services to ensure that it reflects our recent pricing experience 

  

valuation of assets and liabilities of business combinations 

  

in accordance with business combination accounting we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and inprocess research and development based on their estimated fair values determining these fair values requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets 

  

our identifiable intangible assets acquired consist of developed technology core technology tradenames customer lists and contracts software support agreements and related relationships and consulting contracts developed technology consists of 

  

products that have reached technological feasibility core technology represents a combination of processes inventions and trade secrets related to the design and development of acquired products customer lists and contracts and software support agreements and related relationships represent the underlying relationships and agreements with customers of the acquiree’s installed base we have generally valued intangible assets using a discounted cash flow model critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to 

  

   

   

   

   

in addition we estimate the useful lives of our intangible assets based upon the expected period over which we anticipate generating economic benefits from the related intangible asset 

  

net tangible assets consist of the fair values of tangible assets less the fair values of assumed liabilities and obligations except for deferred revenues and restructuring reserves net tangible assets were generally valued by us at the respective carrying amounts recorded by the acquiree as we believed that their carrying values approximated their fair values at the acquisition date 

  

the values assigned to deferred revenue reflect an amount equivalent to the estimated cost plus an appropriate profit margin to perform the services related to the acquiree’s software support contracts restructuring reserves include the severance costs related to employees of the acquiree planned closure of certain facilities and other costs associated with exiting activities of the acquiree 

  

our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable at that time but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions estimates or actual results 

  

valuation of goodwill and acquired intangible assets 

  

our net goodwill and acquired intangible assets totaled 2588 million and 565 million as of september 30 2005 and 2004 respectively as described in note m of “notes to consolidated financial statements” we have two reporting units 1 our software products reportable segment and 2 our services reportable segment as of september 30 2005 and 2004 goodwill and acquired intangible assets in the aggregate attributable to our software products reportable segment was 2426 million and 565 million respectively and attributable to our services reportable segment was 162 million and 0 million respectively the increase in goodwill and acquired intangible assets in 2005 is due primarily to our acquisition of arbortext which resulted in goodwill and acquired intangible assets of 1967 million 

  

we assess the impairment of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets on at least an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable factors we consider important on an overall company basis and reportable segment basis as applicable that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results significant changes in our use of the acquired assets or a significant change in the strategy for our business significant negative industry or economic trends a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period or a reduction of our market capitalization relative to net book value 

  

the goodwill impairment test prescribed by sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires us to identify reporting units and to determine estimates of the fair values of our reporting units as of the date we test for impairment to conduct these tests of goodwill the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value if the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeded its fair value we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value of goodwill and its fair value we estimate the fair values of our reporting units using discounted cash flow valuation models those models require estimates of future revenues profits capital expenditures working capital and discount rates for each reporting unit we estimate these amounts by evaluating historical trends current budgets operating plans and industry data we conduct our annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite lived assets as of the end of the third quarter of each fiscal year we completed our annual impairment review as of the end of the third quarter of 2005 and concluded that no impairment charge was required as of that date 

  

for longlived assets and identifiable intangible assets other than goodwill we reassess the recoverability of the asset based on projected undiscounted future cash flows over the asset’s remaining life if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reportable segment below its carrying value when the carrying value of the asset exceeds its undiscounted cash flows we record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset determined using projected discounted future cash flows of the asset determining the fair value of our reporting units for the purpose of testing the potential impairment of individual assets and goodwill requires significant judgment by management different judgments could yield different results 

  

accounting for income taxes 

  

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to calculate our income tax expense based on taxable income by jurisdiction there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenuesharing and costreimbursement arrangements among related entities and the differing tax treatment of revenue and cost items across various jurisdictions if a foreign jurisdiction were to require us to revise our cost reimbursement arrangements that revision could affect our tax liability 

  

the income tax accounting process also involves estimating our actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheet we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized we must establish a valuation allowance as a charge to income tax expense in 2002 we increased our deferred tax valuation allowance and recorded a corresponding 480 million charge to income tax expense and in 2005 2004 and 2003 we have fully reserved for additional deferred tax assets in the us and certain foreign jurisdictions primarily related to net operating loss carryforwards generated the decision to record the valuation allowance required significant management judgment had we not recorded this valuation allowance we would have reported materially different results significant management judgment is required to determine when the realization of our deferred tax assets in the future is considered more likely than not if and when we conclude that realization is more likely than not we will record a reduction to our valuation allowance that will increase net income goodwill andor additional paidincapital in the period such determination is made while we have realized consolidated operating profits over the last several quarters we have not yet concluded that realization of all of our deferred tax assets in the future is more likely than not in the fourth quarter of 2005 due principally to the tax expense associated with the grant and vesting of restricted stock units and the stock option exchange our us legal entities incurred a taxable loss net deferred tax assets at september 30 2005 were 41 million comprised of deferred tax assets of 1881 million deferred tax liabilities of 314 million and a valuation allowance of 1526 million our deferred tax assets consist primarily of net operating loss carryforwards 

  

accounting for pensions 

  

we sponsor a frozen pension plan covering mostly inactive participants in the united states we make several assumptions that are used in calculating the expense and liability of the plans these key assumptions include the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate in selecting the expected longterm rate of return on assets we consider the average future rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits under the pension plan this includes considering the plan’s asset allocations and the expected returns likely to be earned over the life of this plan the discount rate reflects the estimated rate at which an amount that is invested in a portfolio of highquality debt instruments would provide the future cash flows necessary to pay benefits when they come due in addition our actuarial consultants determine the expense and liabilities of the plan using other assumptions for future experience such as mortality rates the actuarial assumptions used by us may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions or longer or shorter life spans of the participants our actual results could differ materially from those we estimated which could require us to record a greater amount of pension expense in future years for both 2005 and 2004 we used a discount rate of 60 and an expected return on plan assets of 75 

  

certain of our foreign subsidiaries also sponsor pension plans accounting and reporting for these plans requires the use of countryspecific assumptions for discount rates and expected rates of return on assets we apply a consistent methodology in determining 

  

the key assumptions which in addition to future experience assumptions such as mortality rates are used by our actuaries to determine our liability and expense for each of these plans for both 2005 and 2004 we used weighted average discount rates of 55 and a weighted average expected return on plan assets of 48 

  

the most sensitive assumptions used in calculating the expense and liability of our pension plans are the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets a 50 basis point change to our discount rate and expected return on plan assets assumptions would not have changed our pension expense for the year ended september 30 2005 by more than 10 million 

  

accounting for stockbased awards 

  

we adopted sfas no 123r sharebased payment on july 3 2005 effective with the beginning of our fourth quarter sfas no 123r requires us to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grantdate fair value of the award using an option pricing model that cost is recognized as an expense over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award prior to the adoption of sfas no 123r we determined stockbased compensation in accordance with apb no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees  which required only the expensing of the intrinsic value of stockbased awards as substantially all of our stock options issued to employees have had no intrinsic value at their date of grant our recognized stockbased compensation expenses were immaterial prior to adoption of sfas no 123r 

  

we historically granted stock options to employees and offered employees the opportunity to purchase shares under our employee stock purchase plan we did not grant any stock options during 2005 and in mid2005 we suspended offerings under our employee stock purchase plan 

  

going forward we plan to use restricted shares and restricted stock units as our principal equity incentive awards in the fourth quarter of 2005 we granted shares of restricted stock to our directors and executive officers and granted restricted stock units to our employees half of the shares of restricted stock granted to our executive officers have timebased vesting requirements and half of them have performancebased vesting requirements subject to subsequent timebased restrictions under sfas no 123r we will determine the fair value of restricted shares and restricted stock units based on the excess of the fair market value of our common stock at the date of grant as compared to the exercise price if any of the award in determining the amount of expense to be recorded for restricted shares and restricted stock units judgment is required by us to estimate forfeitures of the awards and to assess the probability of achievement of performancebased award targets if actual forfeitures or actual performancebased target achievement differs from our estimates our results of operations could be impacted 

  

allowance for accounts and other receivables 

  

management judgment is required in assessing the collectibility of customer accounts and other receivables for which we generally do not require collateral we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments in determining the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts management specifically analyzes individual accounts receivable historical bad debts customer concentrations customer creditworthiness current economic conditions accounts receivable aging trends and changes in our customer payment terms the following table summarizes our accounts receivable and related reserve balances at september 30 2005 and 2004 

  

   

if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate additional allowances might be required resulting in future operating expenses that are not included in the allowance for doubtful accounts our customer base consists of large numbers of geographically diverse customers dispersed across many industries and no individual customer comprised more than 10 of our net trade accounts receivable for any period presented 

  

restructuring charges 

  

we periodically record restructuring charges resulting from restructuring our operations including consolidations andor relocations of operations changes to our strategic plan or managerial responses to declines in demand increasing costs or other environmental factors the determination of restructuring charges requires management judgment and may include costs related to employee benefits such as costs of severance and termination benefits and estimates of costs for future lease commitments on excess facilities net of estimated future sublease income in determining the amount of the facilities charge we are required to estimate such factors as future vacancy rates the time required to sublet properties and sublease rates these estimates are reviewed quarterly based on known real estate market conditions and the creditworthiness of subtenants and may result in revisions to established facility reserves we have accrued 297 million as of september 30 2005 related to excess facilities compared to 417 million at september 30 2004 representing gross lease commitments with agreements expiring at various dates through 2014 of approximately 620 million net of committed and estimated sublease income of approximately 313 million and a present value factor of 10 million we have entered into signed sublease arrangements for approximately 245 million with the remaining 68 million based on future estimated sublease arrangements including 60 million for space currently available for sublease if our sublease assumptions prove to be inaccurate we may need to make changes in these estimates that would affect our results of operations and potentially our financial condition 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

   

we invest our cash with highly rated financial institutions and in diversified domestic and international money market mutual funds the portfolio is invested in shortterm instruments to ensure cash is available to meet requirements as needed at september 30 2005 cash and cash equivalents totaled 2044 million down from 2949 million at september 30 2004 the decrease in cash and cash equivalents in 2005 is due primarily to acquisitions of businesses which used cash of 1989 million payments for the stock option exchange described below totaling 127 million and additions to property equipment and intangible assets of 161 million offset by 1281 million of cash provided by operations and 102 million provided by net proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock plans the increase in cash and cash equivalents during 2004 consisted primarily of 1013 million provided by operations and 97 million provided by net proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock plans partially offset by 124 million for capital additions to property equipment and intangible assets and 98 million for the acquisition of ohio design 

  

cash provided by operations was 1281 million in 2005 compared to 1013 million in 2004 the higher cash provided by operations was due primarily to 

  

   

   

   

these increases were offset by increases in current and noncurrent accounts receivable due in part to increased revenue in 2005 days sales outstanding remaining relatively flat at 68 days at september 30 2005 compared to 69 days at september 30 2004 and to our decision to decrease our sales of accounts receivable to thirdparty financial institutions in 2005 compared to prior years 

  

cash provided by operations was 1013 million in 2004 compared to 65 million in 2003 the higher cash provided by operations in 2004 as compared to 2003 was due primarily to 

  

   

   

   

these increases were partially offset by 

  

   

   

days sales outstanding in accounts receivable improved to 69 days at september 30 2004 from 77 days at september 30 2003 

  

cash and cash equivalents used provided by investing activities was 2150 million in 2005 compared to 223 million in 2004 and 55 million in 2003 in 2005 and 2004 we had cash expenditures of 1989 million and 98 million respectively for business acquisitions during the fourth quarter of 2005 we completed the acquisition of arbortext for approximately 192 million net of cash acquired cash used for additions to property equipment and intangible assets was 161 million 125 million and 259 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively cash used for additions to property equipment and intangible assets decreased in 2004 due to the completion of our investment in a new erp system in 2003 and to lower capital requirements as a result of our restructuring plan initiated in 2003 and completed in 2004 which reduced the number of our operating facilities and employee headcount our expenditures for property and equipment consist primarily of computer equipment software office equipment and facility improvements cash provided by investing activities in 2003 included net proceeds from sales and maturities of investments of 314 million as we moved our investment portfolio to shortterm securities to minimize interest rate risk 

  

cash used provided by financing activities was 20 million in 2005 97 million in 2004 and 75 million in 2003 the decrease in 2005 compared to 2004 is primarily due to payments of 127 million related to the stock option exchange described below the increase in 2004 compared to 2003 was due primarily to higher proceeds from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans cash proceeds from the issuance of our common stock under our stock plans were 102 million 97 million and 77 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively 

  

in december 2004 the financial accounting standard board fasb issued sfas no 123r sharebased payment regarding revised accounting rules for companysponsored stock purchase plans in light of these accounting changes we suspended offerings under our employee stock purchase plan espp as of the date of the offering that was to have commenced on february 1 2005 

  

on march 10 2005 our stockholders approved amendments to our 2000 equity incentive plan that 1 authorized us to exchange and cancel certain outstanding outofthemoney nonexecutive employee stock options for either cash or shares of restricted stock 2 authorize the grant of restricted stock units and 3 enable us to grant a greater number of shares of restricted stock as equity awards the amendments are designed to reduce the overall number of employee stock options outstanding and reduce potential stockholder dilution we completed the option exchange on august 3 2005 we paid 127 million in exchange for 183 million options going forward we anticipate that we will make more use of restricted stock and restricted stock unit grants which require 

  

fewer shares to deliver comparable value than stock options  the use of restricted shares and restricted stock units coupled with suspension of the espp will result in lower cash proceeds to us the espp and exercise of employee stock options generated cash proceeds of 102 million and 97 million in 2005 and 2004 respectively 

  

in september 1998 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 200 million shares of our common stock and in july 2000 increased the shares authorized for repurchase to 400 million we made no repurchases in 2005 and 2004 since 1998 and through september 30 2005 we repurchased at a cost of 3668 million a total of 312 million shares of the 400 million shares authorized 

  

we believe that existing cash and cash equivalents together with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements through at least the next twelve months during 2006 we expect to make cash disbursements estimated at 11 million for restructuring charges incurred in 2005 and prior periods and 3 million for costs associated with the execution of our arbortext integration plan capital expenditures for 2006 are currently anticipated to be approximately 15 million and we estimate contributions to our defined benefit plans to be approximately 4 million 

  

we completed two acquisitions in the first quarter of 2006 for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 12 million these acquisitions add to our global consulting and training services organization the first was of an entity based solely in germanspeaking europe and expands our consulting delivery capacity and expertise in that region the second was of the assets of a us company that developed and provided training solutions for our products we do not expect any significant revenue contribution in the nearterm from these acquisitions 

  

we have evaluated and expect to continue to evaluate possible strategic transactions including possible dispositions of certain businesses on an ongoing basis and at any given time may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to possible strategic transactions our cash position could be reduced and we may incur debt obligations to the extent we complete any significant transactions 

  

contractual obligations 

  

we lease office facilities and certain equipment under operating leases that expire at various dates through 2014 including an operating lease agreement related to our headquarters office in needham massachusetts entered into in 2000 which expires in december 2012 subject to certain renewal rights these leases qualify for operating lease accounting treatment and as such are not included on our balance sheet at september 30 2005 our contractual obligations including future minimum lease payments net of sublease income under noncancellable operating leases are as follows 

  

     

   

as of september 30 2005 we have letters of credit and bank guarantees outstanding of approximately 63 million primarily related to the lease of our headquarters in needham massachusetts 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

we have not created and are not party to any specialpurpose or offbalance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital incurring debt or operating parts of our business that are not consolidated to the extent of our ownership interest therein into our financial statements we have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby we have subordinated retained interests derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks contingent liabilities or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing liquidity market risk or credit risk support to us 

  

new accounting pronouncements 

  

in accordance with recently issued accounting pronouncements we will be required to comply with certain changes in accounting rules and regulations 

  

accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations 

  

in march 2005 the fasb issued interpretation no 47 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no 143 fin 47 fin 47 is effective for fiscal years ending after december 15 2005 fin 47 clarifies that an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the liability’s fair value can be reasonably estimated and clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation we do not expect that the adoption of fin 47 will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 

  

accounting changes and error correction 

  

on june 7 2005 the fasb issued statement no 154 accounting changes and error corrections  a replacement of apb opinion no 20 accounting changes  and statement no 3 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements sfas no 154 sfas no 154 changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle previously most voluntary changes in accounting principles required recognition in a cumulative effect adjustment within net income of the period of the change sfas no 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods’ financial statements unless it is impracticable to determine either the periodspecific effects or the cumulative effect of the change sfas no 154 is effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after december 15 2005 however this standard does not change the transition provisions of any existing accounting pronouncements we will determine the impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements when an accounting change or error correction occurs 

  

important factors that may affect future results 

  

the following are important factors we have identified that could affect our future results they should be considered when evaluating forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report on form 10k and otherwise made by us or on our behalf because these factors could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in forwardlooking statements 

  

i operational considerations 

  

our operating results fluctuate within each quarter and from quarter to quarter making our future revenues and operating results difficult to predict 

  

while our sales cycle varies substantially from customer to customer a high percentage of our revenue has historically been generated in the third month of each fiscal quarter and this revenue tends to be concentrated in the later part of that month our orders early in a quarter will not generally occur at a rate which if sustained throughout the quarter would be sufficient to assure that we will meet our revenue targets for any particular quarter moreover our transition from a oneproduct company to a multiproduct company our increased use of indirect distribution channels through alliances with resellers and other strategic partners and our shift in business emphasis to offering a product development system comprised of components that can be purchased in stages have resulted in more unpredictable and often longer sales cycles for products and services accordingly our quarterly results may be difficult to predict prior to the end of the quarter any inability to obtain large orders or orders in large volumes or to make shipments or perform services in the period immediately preceding the end of any particular quarter may cause the results for that quarter to fall short of our revenue targets in addition our operating expenses are based on expected future revenue and are largely fixed for the short term as a result a revenue shortfall in any quarter could cause our earnings for that quarter to fall below expectations as well any failure to meet our quarterly revenue or earnings targets could adversely impact the market price of our stock 

  

other factors that may cause quartertoquarter revenue and earnings fluctuations or that may affect our ability to make quarterend shipments include the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

in addition the levels of quarterly or annual software or service revenue in general or for particular geographic areas may not be comparable to those achieved in previous periods 

  

general economic and political conditions may impact our results 

  

our revenue growth and profitability depends on the overall demand for software and related services over the past several years this demand has been adversely affected by unfavorable economic conditions as customers have reduced or have deferred spending on information technology improvements which in turn has affected our operating results although we recently have seen modest improvements in information technology spending a return to unfavorable economic conditions could materially and adversely affect us 

  

political and social events in recent years including concerns regarding terrorism have the potential to put further pressure on economic conditions both domestically and internationally the potential turmoil that may result from such events contributes to the uncertainty of the economic climate the impact of such conditions may have a materially adverse impact on our business operating results and financial position 

  

our cost structure is relatively fixed in the short term which makes it difficult to reduce our expenses quickly in response to declines in revenue or revenue growth 

  

we made incremental expenditures to support our revenue growth in 2005 and to support anticipated future growth our expenses associated with headcount and facilities can be difficult to reduce quickly due to the nature of those items if revenue does not grow 

  

at the rate we expect or if it declines our expenses may constitute a larger percentage of our operating budget than we planned which would adversely affect our profitability 

  

we use in tandem with our direct sales force third parties such as resellers and other strategic partners for the distribution and implementation of our software solutions which makes it more difficult to manage the sales process 

  

we have entered into relationships with groups of geographically dispersed resellers and other strategic partners to promote sell andor implement our products which can reduce our control over the sales process and the delivery of services to our customers our ability to distribute and implement our software solutions through third parties will depend on 

  

   

   

   

   

we may be unable to implement new initiatives successfully 

  

part of our recent success has resulted from our ability to implement new initiatives including new product introductions technology acquisitions and organizational changes our future operating results will continue to depend upon 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

we may be unable to successfully acquire and integrate strategic businesses and any businesses we acquire may not achieve the revenue and earnings we anticipated 

  

the success of our longterm strategic plan depends in part on our ability to acquire strategic businesses if we are unable to identify and acquire appropriate strategic businesses or if the businesses we acquire do not generate the revenue and earnings we expect we may not achieve our revenue targets 

  

in addition business combinations involve a number of factors that affect operations including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

as a result we may fail to successfully integrate and manage businesses that we may acquire without incurring substantial expenses delays or other problems that could negatively impact our results of operations if our shortterm liquidity declines or we are forced to divert attention from other initiatives due to resource constraints in connection with acquisitionrelated activity our ability to implement other strategic initiatives or make investments in our operational infrastructure could be impaired 

  

we are dependent on key personnel whose loss could cause delays in our product development and sales efforts 

  

our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical managerial and sales personnel competition for such personnel in our industry is intense this competition is even greater in offshore regions where we have shifted certain research and development resources and where concerted efforts to solicit employees are not uncommon we assume that we will continue to be able to attract and retain such personnel our failure to do so however could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

we must continually modify and enhance our products to keep pace with changing technology and we may experience delays in developing and debugging our software 

  

we must continually modify and enhance our products to keep pace with changes in computer software hardware and database technology as well as emerging internet standards we must also continually expend efforts to review and fix errors “bugs” found in our current and upcoming software releases our ability to remain competitive will depend on our ability to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

also as is common in the computer software industry we may from time to time experience delays in our product development and “debugging” efforts our performance could be hurt by significant delays in developing completing or shipping new or enhanced products moreover if significant bugs were found in our software products we could be adversely impacted by negative customer reaction and could experience delays in our new product development efforts as development resources might need to be shifted toward our debugging efforts among other things such delays could cause us to incorrectly predict the fiscal quarter in which we will realize revenue from the shipment of the new or enhanced products and give our competitors a greater opportunity to market competing products 

  

we may be adversely affected by a decline in demand for plm solutions 

  

we currently derive our license and service revenues predominantly from our integrated plm software products and services and we expect this to continue into the future as a result factors affecting the demand for plm software solutions or pricing pressures on this single category could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

  

we depend on sales within the discrete manufacturing market 

  

a large amount of our revenues are related to sales to customers in the discrete manufacturing sector a decline in spending in this sector could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

  

we depend on sales from outside the united states that could be adversely affected by changes in the international markets 

  

a significant portion of our business comes from outside the united states accordingly our performance could be adversely affected by economic downturns in europe or the asiapacific region another consequence of significant international business is that a large percentage of our revenues and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies that fluctuate in value although we may from time to time enter into foreign exchange forward contracts andor foreign exchange option contracts to offset a portion of the foreign exchange fluctuations unanticipated events may have a material impact on our results other risks associated with international business include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights 

  

our software products and our trademarks including our company names product names and logos are proprietary we protect our intellectual property rights in these items by relying on copyrights trademarks patents and common law safeguards including trade secret protection as well as restrictions on disclosures and transferability contained in our agreements with other parties 

  

despite these measures the laws of all relevant jurisdictions may not afford adequate protection to our products and other intellectual property in addition we frequently encounter attempts by individuals and companies to pirate our software solutions if our measures to protect our intellectual property rights fail others may be able to use those rights which could reduce our competitiveness and harm our business 

  

intellectual property infringement claims could be asserted against us which could be expensive to defend and could result in the loss of our rights 

  

the software industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding copyright patent and other intellectual property rights while we have not to date had any significant claims of this type asserted against us such claims could be asserted against us in the future if a lawsuit of this type is filed it could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel we cannot be sure that we would prevail against any such asserted claims if we did not prevail we could be prevented from using that intellectual property or required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements which might not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all in addition to possible claims with respect to our proprietary information some of our products contain technology developed by and licensed from third parties and we may likewise be susceptible to infringement claims with respect to these thirdparty technologies 

  

ii product related considerations 

  

increasing competition in the computeraided design marketplace may reduce our revenues 

  

a large portion of our revenues are currently derived from our computeraided design solutions and there are an increasing number of competitive design products some of which emphasize lower price points and ease of use compared to the more robust functionality of our solutions this increased competition makes attracting new customers more difficult in addition some competitive products have reached a level of functionality whereby product differentiation is less likely in and of itself to dislodge incumbent design systems given the training data conversion and other startup costs associated with system replacement although proengineer wildfire which focuses on plm interoperability and ease of use and other initiatives are designed to address these competitive pressures increased competition and further market acceptance of competitive products could have a negative effect on pricing and revenue for our products which could have a material adverse affect on our results 

  

in addition even though our design software is capable of performing on a variety of platforms as compared to several of our competitors whose products focus on single platform applications particularly windowsbased platforms we may be unable to create a competitive advantage by offering multiple platform applications 

  

as we expand the breadth of our product line and add to the vertical markets in which we serve we may face increased pressure to provide enhanced products which may be difficult with our limited development resources 

  

we continue to enhance our existing product line by releasing updates as well as new productsmodules our competitive position and operating results could suffer if 

  

   

   

   

   

   

growth in the computeraided design solutions industry has slowed 

  

growth in certain segments of the computeraided design solutions industry has slowed and coupled with decreased functional differentiation among flexible engineering tools may adversely affect our ability to penetrate the market for new customers and 

  

recapture our market share over the long term we believe our emphasis on plm solutions will allow us to differentiate our cadcamcae solutions from the competition and stabilize sales of our cadcamcae solutions products while we seek to increase sales of our enterprise solutions however the strategy may not be successful or may take longer than we expect our operating results in any quarter could be materially adversely affected if these assumptions are incorrect 

  

our assumptions about the product lifecycle management plm market opportunity may be wrong 

  

we have identified plm as a market opportunity for us and have devoted significant resources toward capitalizing on that opportunity we offer a suite of plm solutions and related services targeted at this market based on our enterprise solutions together with our desktop solutions this suite includes software and services that use internet technologies to enable our customers’ employees suppliers and customers to collaboratively develop build distribute and manage products throughout their entire lifecycle because the market for software products that enable companies to collaborate on product information on an enterprisewide level is newly emerging we cannot be sure of the size of this market whether it will grow whether companies will elect to use our products or acquire plm solutions from other sources or forego plm initiatives altogether 

  

in addition companies that have already invested substantial resources in other methods of sharing product information in the designthroughmanufacture process may be reluctant to adopt a new approach that may replace limit or compete with their existing systems or methods we expect that we will continue to need to educate prospective customers about the uses and benefits of our products demand for and market acceptance of our products will be affected by the success of those efforts 

  

we must successfully differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors 

  

the success of our plm strategy will depend in large part on the ability of our solutions to meet customer expectations especially with respect to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

our opportunity in the small and mediumsized business market for our solutions when manufacturers migrate from twodimensional design tools to entrylevel threedimensional design tools depends on large part on our ability to educate consumers on the benefits and ease of use of our products likewise with larger strategic customers we must differentiate our products’ capabilities from those of our competitors including larger companies with established enterprisewide relationships with these customers 

  

our solutions strategy is developing 

  

we are pursuing a strategy to provide a series of easily deployable plm solutions that address specific business challenges that arise at points along the product lifecycle timeline our windchill link solutions by offering preconfigured fully integrated applications that can be implemented quickly our strategy is designed both to solve customers’ problems relating to costly largescale implementation projects and to provide customers with the ability to deploy a product development system that meets their evolving requirements if we are unable to provide these solutions or are unable to meet customer expectations our overall revenue may be adversely affected 

  

we have also been enhancing our suite of products to allow us to offer solutions aimed at vertical industries outside the discrete manufacturing market that we have traditionally served these include ecm solutions for customers in the life sciences financial 

  

services government and publishing markets and our enterprise solutions specially configured for the retail footwear and apparel industry while these solutions are generally comprised of a subset of our overall plm solutions configured to meet the specific needs of the vertical industry we may be unable to penetrate these markets support these solutions or maintain customer relationships in order to attain sustained business if we are unable to do so our success in these new markets will be limited 

  

our windchill link solutions may crowd out service revenue and our initiatives to use select resellers to distribute these solutions may put pressure on license margins 

  

our introduction of our windchill link solutions which have been developed to permit quick installation and provide customers more autonomy over solving their problems may have an adverse effect on our service revenue additionally we also have begun to offer a limited number of qualified resellers the ability to offer our windchill link solutions we believe that facilitating ease of implementation and entering into these relationships will best serve to expand the coverage of our plm software solutions generate sufficient additional license revenue to compensate for reduced margins and provide the necessary regional coverage for their implementation and support if these assumptions are inaccurate or if projected additional license revenue andor broader market coverage does not materialize our revenues may be adversely affected 

  

plm software solutions must meet our customers’ expectations for integration with existing systems to generate references for new accounts 

  

our plm software must integrate with our customers’ and their partners’ existing computer systems and software programs in certain cases we use thirdparty technologies to facilitate these integrations as many of our customers will be facing these integration issues for the first time particularly in the context of collaborating with customers supply chain partners and other members of the extended enterprise our customers could become dissatisfied with our products or services if systems integration proves to be difficult costly or time consuming and our operating results could be adversely affected moreover due to the emerging nature of the industry and technology the sales process relies in large part on customer references accordingly if our customers become dissatisfied future business and revenues may be adversely affected 

  

competition is increasing which may reduce our profits and limit or reduce our market share 

  

the market for our plm software solutions is new highly fragmented rapidly changing and increasingly competitive we expect competition to intensify which could result in price reductions for our products and services reduced gross margins and loss of market share our primary competition comes from 

  

   

   

in addition analysts expect future consolidation within the software industry which could give rise to new competitors to compete effectively in this evolving industry we must 

  

   

   

   

further our services organization may face increasing competition for followon consulting implementation and education services from other thirdparty consultants and service providers including those of larger better known consulting firms that exert considerable influence within portions of our customer base to overcome the influence of larger enterprise software and consulting firms within our customer base we must successfully demonstrate the superiority of our offerings as well as a high level of customer satisfaction 

  

iii other considerations 

  

if companies are unable to use the internet as a medium of secure collaboration our plm strategy would be seriously harmed 

  

the use of the internet for collaboration is still relatively new if the infrastructure for the internet does not efficiently support enterprises and their supply chain partners or if concerns over the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks inhibit the growth of the internet as a means of collaborating across enterprises companies and their supply chain partners may not adopt or continue to use the internet as a medium of exchanging product information if this happens we may be unable to retain customers or to attract new customers which would impede our planned growth 

  

if we implement a reverse stock split our total market capitalization after the reverse stock split may be lower than the total market capitalization before the reverse stock split and the market price of ptc common stock following the reverse stock split may not exceed or remain higher than the market price before the proposed reverse stock split 

  

on march 10 2005 our stockholders authorized us to implement a 2for5 reverse stock split at any time before our 2006 annual meeting which will be held on march 1 2006 if we implement the proposed reverse stock split the total market capitalization of ptc common stock the aggregate value of all ptc common stock at the then market price after the reverse stock split may not be equal to or greater than the total market capitalization before the reverse stock split and the per share market price of ptc common stock following the reverse stock split may not trade at or above a price in direct proportion to the reduction in the number of shares of ptc common stock outstanding before the reverse stock split for example based on the closing market price of ptc common stock on december 9 2005 of 581 per share if the board of directors decided to implement the reverse stock split the per share postsplit market price of ptc common stock may not remain at or above 14525 per share or greater 

  

in addition a decline in the market price of ptc common stock after the reverse stock split may result in a greater percentage decline than would occur in the absence of a reverse stock split and the liquidity of ptc common stock could be adversely affected following such a reverse stock split 

  

further a reverse stock split would increase the number of stockholders who own odd lots less than 100 shares potentially increasing their trading costs as holders of odd lots typically incur higher costs to sell their shares and may have greater difficulty in effecting sales 

  

finally the increased proportion of authorized and unissued shares to outstanding shares as a result of a reverse stock split could in certain circumstances have an antitakeover effect for example it would permit issuances that would dilute the stock ownership of a person seeking to effect a change in the composition of the board of directors or contemplating a tender offer or other transaction for the combination of ptc with another company 

  

our stock price has been highly volatile which may make it harder to resell your shares at a time and at a price that is favorable to you 

  

market prices for securities of software companies have generally been volatile in particular the market price of these stocks has been and may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies the trading prices and valuations of these stocks and of ours may not be predictable negative changes in the public’s perception of the prospects of software companies or of ptc or the plm market generally could depress our stock price regardless of our results 

  

also traditionally a large percentage of our common stock has been held by institutional investors purchases and sales of our common stock by these institutional investors could have a significant impact on the market price of the stock for more information about those investors please see our proxy statement with respect to our most recent annual meeting of stockholders and schedules 13d and 13g filed with the sec with respect to our common stock 

  

we are currently defending a lawsuit seeking substantial damages in which we could be liable 

  

on may 30 2003 a lawsuit was filed against us in the us district court for the district of massachusetts by rand a technology corporation and rand technologies limited together “rand” rand historically had been our largest distributor the complaint 

  

alleges various breaches of a revised oneyear distribution agreement entered into in december 2002 as well as other agreements between rand and us and also asserts certain noncontract claims the complaint as amended seeks equitable relief and substantial damages on november 24 2003 we filed our substantive response to rand’s complaint and asserted counterclaims against rand during the second quarter of 2005 rand quantified its claimed actual damages as being in excess of 50 million and rand asserts that this amount should be trebled by the court as a result of several recent rulings by the court some of rand’s claims have been dismissed while others will proceed to trial and rand’s possible maximum recovery under the lawsuit may have been reduced in addition the court has excluded the testimony of the damages expert hired by rand to substantiate rand’s damages quantification the court has also issued a ruling granting ptc summary judgment on one of ptc’s counterclaims against rand despite these rulings several of rand’s claims as well as certain of our counterclaims remain to be tried before a jury we believe rand’s claims and its damages assessment associated with those claims are without merit and will continue to contest them vigorously we also intend diligently to prosecute our counterclaims we cannot predict the ultimate resolution of this action at this time and we cannot assure you that this action if determined adversely to us will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

we face exposure to financial market risks including adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 

  

foreign currency exchange risk 

  

our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to western european countries and japan we enter into various hedging transactions to manage this risk we do not enter into or hold foreign currency derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

  

our nonus revenues generally are transacted through our nonus subsidiaries and typically are denominated in their local currency in addition our nonus expenses that are incurred by our nonus subsidiaries typically are denominated in their local currency approximately 62 65 and 63 of our total revenue was from sales to customers outside of north america in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively approximately 45 45 and 43 of our total expenses were incurred by our subsidiaries domiciled outside of north america in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively 

  

our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations arises in part from intercompany transactions with most intercompany transactions occurring between a us dollar functional currency entity and a foreign currency denominated entity intercompany transactions typically are denominated in the local currency of the nonus subsidiary in order to centralize foreign currency risk also both ptc the parent company and our nonus subsidiaries may transact business with our customers and vendors in a currency other than their functional currency “transaction risk” in addition we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results and balances of our nonus subsidiaries are translated into us dollars “translation risk” if sales to customers outside of the united states continue to comprise a growing percentage of total revenues our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates could increase 

  

our foreign currency risk management strategy is principally designed to mitigate the future potential financial impact of changes in the value of transactions and balances denominated in foreign currency resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates our foreign currency hedging program uses forward contracts to manage the foreign currency exposures that exist as part of our ongoing business operations the contracts primarily are denominated in european currencies and japanese yen and have maturities of less than three months 

  

generally we do not designate foreign currency forward contracts as hedges for accounting purposes and changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized immediately in earnings because we enter into forward contracts only as an economic hedge any gain or loss on the underlying foreigndenominated balance would be offset by the loss or gain on the forward contract gains and losses on forward contracts and foreign denominated receivables and payables are included in other income expense net as 

  

of september 30 2005 and 2004 we had outstanding forward contracts with notional amounts equivalent to approximately 567 million 183 million in euros 155 million in british pounds 65 million in japanese yen 50 million in korean won and 114 million in other currencies and 833 million 589 million in euros 121 million in british pounds 64 million in japanese yen and 59 million in other currencies respectively 

  

we periodically use foreign currency option contracts to hedge specific forecasted net cash flow transactions that are derived from anticipated nonus revenue foreign currency option contracts are designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes and changes in the fair value of the option contract are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings when the underlying forecasted transaction impacts earnings as of september 30 2005 and 2004 there were no foreign currency option contracts outstanding 

  

cash and cash equivalents 

  

as of september 30 2005 cash equivalents are invested in highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased we invest our cash with highly rated financial institutions in north america europe and asiapacific and in diversified domestic and international money market mutual funds at september 30 2005 we had 770 million 645 million 492 million and 137 million of cash and cash equivalents in the united states europe japan and other nonus countries principally in asiapacific respectively given the short maturities and investment grade quality of the portfolio holdings at september 30 2005 a hypothetical 10 change in interest rates would not materially affect the fair value of our cash and cash equivalents 

  

our invested cash is subject to interest rate and for nonus operations foreign currency risk in a declining interest rate environment we would experience a decrease in interest income the opposite holds true in a rising interest rate environment over the past several years the us federal reserve board european central bank and bank of england have changed certain benchmark interest rates which has led to declines and increases in market interest rates these changes in market interest rates have resulted in fluctuations in interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents interest income will continue to fluctuate based on changes in market interest rates and levels of cash available for investment our consolidated cash balances were impacted unfavorably in 2005 and favorably in 2004 by the weakening and strengthening respectively of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar particularly with respect to the euro and the japanese yen

 item 9a controls and procedures 

  

effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures 

  

our management under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer our principal executive officer and principal financial officer respectively has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended as of the end of the period covered by this report based on this evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec rules and forms and that information is accumulated and communicated to our management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures 

  

on november 2 2005 we announced that we had identified irregularities in certain sales orders in the asiapacific region our audit committee using outside advisors undertook an investigation regarding the accounting impact of order practices in the region that investigation has been completed and we have determined that the errors identified in the investigation which principally relate to our 20012003 fiscal years are not material to our reported financial results for prior and current periods and do not require restatement of those results in order to address the matters identified during the investigation and during our assessment of our internal control over financial reporting we are implementing enhancements to our sales and finance procedures in the asiapacific region in fiscal year 2006 we are continuing to review business practices in the region to ensure compliance with our policies 

  

management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting 

  

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f of the exchange act as a process designed by or under the supervision of our principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by our board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that 

  

   

   

   

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of september 30 2005 using the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal controlintegrated framework  management excluded arbortext inc from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of september 30 2005 because it was acquired by us in a purchase business combination during the fourth quarter of 2005 arbortext inc is a wholly owned subsidiary whose total assets and total revenues each represented less than 3 of our related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended september 30 2005 

  

based on this assessment and those criteria our management concluded that as of september 30 2005 our internal control over financial reporting was effective 

  

our management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of september 30 2005 has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which appears under item 8 

  

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

  

there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act that occurred during the quarter ended september 30 2005 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

our footprint of capabilities aligns on an optimized system architecture which is built from the ground up to address the needs of the digital product value chain our product development system architecture is 

  

   

   

   

the following software solutions are part of our overall strategy to provide an integrated portfolio of plm solutions that address specific business challenges that occur at various points in the product lifecycle they are designed to enable manufacturers to implement a product development system appropriate for their particular requirements allowing them to deliver new products to market faster and manage the complexities of product development throughout an evolving supply chain 

  

design solutions 

  

our family of engineering design software encompasses a broad spectrum of engineering disciplines essential to the development of virtually all manufactured products ranging from consumer products to jet aircraft manufacturers compete on the basis of cost time to market and product performance criteria which are significantly affected by the quality and length of the product development process our software solutions offer highperformance product definition capabilities for the creation of digital products that improve product quality and reduce time to market by enabling endusers to evaluate easily multiple design alternatives and to share data with bidirectional associativity 

  

the cornerstone of our design solutions software is proengineer ®  a threedimensional product design solution based on a robust parametric featurebased solid modeler enabling changes made during the design process to be associatively updated throughout the design proengineer consists of capabilities for detailed design cad manufacturingproduction cam and simulationanalysis cae as well as facilities for exchanging cad data with a multitude of sources and in varied standard formats allowing companies to create more innovative differentiated and functional products quickly and easily

the windchill modules have standard features and functions with capabilities that include product and process management collaboration and product planning the predefined templates eg document folders and workflows may be used as is or may be configured to the customer’s business environment for example the workflow template may be changed to reflect the customer’s organizational approval preferences 

  

additionally upon our acquisition of ohio design automation inc in the third quarter of 2004 we now offer the intercomm suite of electronic design collaboration solutions to enable enterprisewide visualization verification annotation and automated comparison of electronic design intent the intercomm solutions provide easy access to complex cae and electronic computer aided design data created in leading electronic design automation eda tools these solutions are targeted toward high tech and electronics manufacturers and other manufacturers of products that contain electronic components in addition to offering the intercomm products as stand alone solutions we have begun to integrate this technology into the windchill product line for future release 

  

services 

  

maintenance services 

  

we offer maintenance support plans for our software products customers who participate in our maintenance support plans receive periodic software updates and new releases active maintenance plan customers also have direct access to our global technical support team of certified engineers an iso 9001 accredited organization resulting in timely and accurate issue resolution in addition we provide selfservice support tools that allow our customers access at all times to an extensive amount of information quickly and dynamically 

  

other services 

  

our software solutions and maintenance support offerings are complemented by additional service offerings from our services organization as well as from thirdparty resellers and other strategic services partners we designed our portfolio of services offerings to leverage our product and process expertise and create value for customers we offer a comprehensive portfolio of services to facilitate the adoption of our technology into an optimized product development environment ensuring alignment of business processes with strategy conditioning the organization to follow new rules and procedures deployment of the “right” technology that supports organizational and strategic goals and driving technology adoption through training programs our services organization focuses on 

  

implementation services  we offer a range of technology installation configuration and migration services from prepackaged “quick start” deployments to full system integration 

  

process and technology adoption services  our consulting services facilitate widespread acceptance and utilization of our solutions addressing organizational challenges and competing priorities our proven methodology helps condition an organization to adopt new processes and enable target users successfully to utilize the applications for measurable productivity gains 

  

education services  we offer an extensive curriculum of instructorled and internetbased training courses to accelerate adoption of the product development system and realize value across the entire enterprise our education services also assist our customers’ users to overcome resistance to change and reluctance to use new tools 

  

product development 

  

for our products to remain competitive we must provide our customers with new and innovative software solutions as a result we continue to spend on research and development and we regularly are looking for opportunities to acquire new technologies suited to our customers’ needs we also must efficiently manage our development resources to ensure that the appropriate balance based on both product development plans and customer demand is reached between product lines 

  

our ability to rapidly develop new design products is facilitated by the modular structure of our software code this structure enables functional capabilities of existing products to be utilized by new software applications or modules thereby reducing the amount of new code required to develop additional products the major benefit of this approach is more rapid development of new functionality our windchill technology has expanded the breadth of our offerings allowing for a comprehensive suite of plm solutions much of this technology is internetcentric javabased objectoriented software and our products depend on these evolving technologies we also license certain technologies from third parties to augment the functionality of our products we generally pay these third parties either periodic royalties or fixed fees for the use of their technologies and rely on them for development and other support we continually review the associated costs development resource savings support levels and if applicable experience with the third party to determine whether the utilization of such technologies is beneficial 

  

we are focusing much of our research and development investment on integrating our products into a unified product development system this strategy is supported by changes we have made to both our product planning and product testing processes these planning and testing phase changes ensure that the products work together in a cohesive system across specific customer business processes 

  

we also work closely with our customers to define improvements and enhancements to be integrated into our products using this approach customers become involved in the software design process to help validate feasibility and to provide feedback on functionality early in the development of our products in addition we maintain software and hardware partner programs designed to provide partners both with access to our products and with the mechanisms and environment to facilitate the integration of complementary products with our product lines through our open software toolkits program members can build tightly integrated solutions that satisfy the various requirements of our customers 

  

information about our research and development expenditures for the threeyear period from 2002 through 2004 may be found in the section titled “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” beginning on page 8 below 

  

sales and marketing 

  

we derive most of our revenue from products and services distributed directly by our sales force to our enduser customers in addition we offer products through thirdparty distributors no single customer accounted for more than 10 of our revenue in any of the last three fiscal years our direct sales force focuses on large accounts while our reseller channel provides a costeffective means of covering the small and medium business market 

  

within our direct sales force there are both strategic accounts and general business accounts units the strategic accounts unit is further segmented into vertical groups such as aerospace and defense automotive consumer products electronics and high technology footwear and apparel industrial products and life sciences this vertical orientation is mirrored in our services delivery organization and increasingly in the products we deliver to strategic accounts in addition we continue to broaden our indirect distribution channel through alliances with thirdparty resellers and other strategic partners who provide products andor services that complement our offerings our resellers distribute products such as proengineer and provide related services throughout north america europe and parts of asiapacific our other strategic partners help complement our product development system with ancillary offerings we also have begun to train a select number of resellers to distribute our windchill link solutions to the small and medium business market 

  

information about our international and domestic operations may be found in note l of “notes to consolidated financial statements” and the section titled “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” beginning on page 8 below 

  

competition 

  

there are a number of companies offering solutions that address specific functional areas covered by our plm solutions such as dassault systemes and ugs for traditional design solutions pdm solutions and visualization and digital mockup solutions agile software corp and matrixone for pdm solutions and i2 technologies inc for part sourcing solutions in addition larger 

  

betterknown enterprisesolution companies with established customers have entered the plm market offering solutions integrated with their other enterprise software applications for example sap offers a solution that controls product data within the larger framework of its erp solution we believe that our plm solutions currently offer broader and deeper functionality more specifically targeted toward the product development processes within discrete manufacturing companies we along with our resellers compete with design products from companies such as autodesk inc and solidworks a subsidiary of dassault systemes for sales to smaller manufacturing customers 

  

proprietary rights 

  

our software products and our trademarks including our company names product names and logos are proprietary we protect our intellectual property rights in these items by relying on copyrights trademarks patents and common law safeguards including trade secret protection as well as restrictions on disclosures and transferability contained in our agreements with other parties despite these measures there can be no assurance that the laws of all relevant jurisdictions will afford adequate protection to our products and other intellectual property 

  

the software industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding copyright patent and other intellectual property rights while we have not to date had any material claims of this type asserted against us there can be no assurance that someone will not assert such claims against us with respect to existing or future products or other intellectual property or that if asserted we would prevail in such claims in the event a lawsuit of this type is filed it could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel whether or not we ultimately prevail 

  

we believe that due to the rapid pace of innovation within our industry factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel are as important to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position within the industry as are the various legal protections surrounding our technology we believe that our products technology and trademarks do not infringe any existing proprietary rights of others although there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims in the future certain of our products also contain technology developed and licensed from third parties we likewise may be susceptible to infringement claims with respect to these thirdparty technologies

backlog 

  

we generally ship our products within 30 days after acceptance of a customer order a high percentage of our license revenue historically has been generated in the third month of each fiscal quarter and this revenue tends to be concentrated in the later part of that month accordingly orders may exist at the end of a quarter that have not been shipped and not recognized as revenue we do not believe that our backlog at any particular point in time is indicative of future sales levels 

  

employees 

  

as of september 30 2004 we had 3042 employees including 945 in sales and marketing 812 in customer support training and consulting 314 in general and administration and 971 in product development of these employees 1362 were located in the united states and 1680 were located outside the united states

executive overview 

  

over the last several years we have been transforming ptc from a oneproduct company in a mature cadcamcae market to a multiproduct company in the emerging plm market our core business focus has been to provide design solutions to customers through our flagship proengineer ® design software and revenue associated with our design solutions continues to comprise a majority of our revenue during the past few years however the discrete market for computeraided design solutions has declined and our revenue in this market also has declined although much of this decline is a result of market factors including unwillingness by customers to invest in this market during difficult economic conditions the decline in our design solutions revenue also is attributable to the relative saturation and increased competitiveness of the north american and european markets for design solutions and the relative difficulty of displacing incumbent software vendors within this finite market 

  

although the discrete market for computeraided design solutions has declined we believe that asiapacific continues to present opportunity for growth as global manufacturing companies have continued to invest in that region the market in that region for both our design and collaboration and control solutions is relatively unsaturated and economic conditions in that region appear to be improving additionally we believe that there is opportunity for growth in the collaboration and control solutions market and we have seen this market and the computeraided design solutions market converge into a broader plm opportunity to position our company to capitalize on the opportunity presented by the emerging plm market we have among other things significantly remodeled our product lines overhauled our distribution infrastructure and created marketing and sales tools aimed at educating our customers concerning the benefits of our offerings much of this investment occurred during the recent economic downturn which in turn put pressure on our revenue performance and operating profitability nevertheless using cash built up during the 1990s when we experienced sustained growth with our design solutions as well as using cash generated from our ongoing operations we were able to proceed with these strategic investments we believe that our investment in this strategy will 

  

contribute to our success over the long term we recently have introduced awardwinning products that allow our customers to implement a scalable product development system that meets their requirements for both functionality and return on investment two critical variables in today’s economic environment 

  

with a good portion of this business transformation investment behind us beginning in 2003 and continuing during 2004 we embarked on cost cutting initiatives focusing on improving profitability although these reductions likely negatively impacted our overall revenue performance in 2003 and 2004 as demonstrated in the following graphs these cost reductions have improved our overall profitability in 2004 and have provided operating leverage for the future 

  

  

looking forward we are focusing on our longterm goals of growing revenue and increasing our operating margins by leveraging our industryleading solutions improved distribution model and reduced cost structure our goal is to increase revenue both by increasing sales of our existing products and by pursuing strategic corporate development opportunities to achieve these goals we intend to embark on a course of making measured increases to our direct sales force and reseller channel to make strategic investments in vertical product solutions as demand for our products dictate and to continue to make strategic investments in the asiapacific market while remaining focused on profitability and actively evaluating potential acquisitions our overall performance will depend on among other factors i improved economic conditions and the strengthening of technology spending in the global manufacturing sector ii our ability to elevate plm expenditures over other technology spending as a budgetary priority among our customers iii our ability to successfully execute our product strategy to provide an integrated easy to use and rapidly deployable suite of plm software solutions that customers can deploy to create a product development system that meets their evolving requirements iv our ability to differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors including larger companies with established enterprise relationships with our customers and v our ability to successfully execute on corporate development initiatives our enhanced suite of plm software solutions provides the foundation for our future growth as these solutions provide a basis for expanding our relationships with existing customers who have previously purchased our traditional highend design products we must accordingly focus on enhancing and marketing our product and service offerings so that our customers are able to understand and realize their advantages 

  

our performance also will depend on our ability to undertake our strategic initiatives while at the same time controlling increases in our current operating cost structure in 2003 we began implementing cost cutting initiatives discussed further below designed to reduce our quarterly operating cost structure to approximately 150 million excluding restructuring charges by the end of fiscal 2004 by the end of the second quarter of 2004 those cost reductions had reduced our quarterly operating cost structure to under 150 million in connection with these reductions we incurred restructuring charges of 429 million in 2004 and 309 million in 2003 we completed our restructuring program in the fourth quarter of 2004 

  

finally our success also will depend on other factors including i our ability to optimize our sales and services coverage and productivity through among other means effective utilization and management of our resellers and other strategic partners as well as our own sales force ii our ability to further improve customer satisfaction and to build customer references iii our effective management of our development resources iv our success at penetrating strategic emerging markets and v our ability to migrate our customers to a more robust plm product development system we believe that we have made progress on these initiatives however spending in our sector of the economy has been weak although recent economic indicators have suggested that technology spending has begun to increase modestly technology spending in the manufacturing sector is expected to lag behind overall increases in technology spending 

  

additional factors affecting our revenues and operating results are identified under “important factors that may affect future results” beginning on page 24

although we experienced modest improvements in our revenue in the second half of 2004 compared to the second half of 2003 our total revenue in 2004 as well as in 2003 and 2002 has declined we attribute these declines to a number of factors including the relative saturation and increased competitiveness of the north american and european markets for design solutions continued reluctance of our customers to consummate large software purchases reduced delivery capacity in connection with headcount reductions in our services business ongoing weakness in technology spending in the global manufacturing economy and the relative infancy of the plm market 

  

we derived 65 63 and 58 of our total revenue from sales to customers outside of north america in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively while we believe ongoing weakness in technology spending continues to affect all of our geographic regions we believe that asiapacific presents the greatest opportunity for growth as global manufacturing companies have continued to invest in that region the market in that region for both our design and collaboration and control solutions is relatively unsaturated and economic conditions in that region appear to be improving 

  

license revenue accounted for 30 31 and 33 of total revenue in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively service revenue which has a lower gross profit margin than license revenue accounted for 70 69 and 67 of total revenue in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively although service revenue as a percentage of overall revenue has increased slightly over this threeyear period the composition of our service revenue has changed compared to 2003 maintenance revenue for 2004 was up 5 down 2 on a consistent foreign currency basis representing 70 of overall services revenue in 2004 compared to 66 in 2003 while other service revenue in 2004 was down 13 over 2003 representing 30 of overall service revenue in 2004 compared to 34 in 2003 maintenance revenue in 2004 was favorably impacted by customers’ adoption of proengineer wildfire and growth in windchill license revenue however our other service revenue consulting implementation education and other support revenue was adversely affected by the removal of a portion of our services delivery headcount in connection with our cost reductions 

  

in the second quarter of 2003 with the launch of proengineer wildfire we began selling a product development system package called “flex 3c” for create collaborate and control this package includes proengineer wildfire with advanced engineering modules windchill projectlink and windchill pdmlink as a data management option because the package includes both design solutions and collaboration and control solutions for purposes of reporting revenues by product categories we allocate revenue from sales of the flex 3c package among our two product categories revenue from sales of new flex 3c licenses is allocated 90 to our design solutions and 10 to our collaboration and control solutions revenue from upgrades to the flex 3c package is allocated 50 to our design solutions and 50 to our collaboration and control solutions in line with customer demand for a complete product development system we foresee that we will continue to offer packages that include both design solutions products and collaboration and control solutions products as such the delineation between the two product lines may become less meaningful and accordingly we may revise our product categories 

  

we have been building and diversifying our reseller channel to become less dependent on a small number of distributors and to provide the resources necessary for more effective distribution of our products although we typically receive lower revenue per seat for an indirect sale versus a direct sale we believe that utilizing diverse and geographically dispersed distributors that focus on smaller businesses will provide an efficient and cost effective means to reach these customers while allowing our direct sales force to focus on larger sales opportunities license sales from our reseller channel which are primarily for design solutions were 562 million 459 million and 440 million in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively this growth is due in part to our efforts to expand our reseller channel as mentioned above we also attribute the increase in reseller channel revenue to the growing success of proengineer wildfire in small and medium businesses both relative to our historic offerings as well as to competitive offerings in this market segment increases in revenue from our reseller channel have occurred in tandem with the expiration of our arrangement with rand a technology corporation which historically had been our largest distributor rand a technology corporation’s distribution rights for certain territories expired on december 31 2003 and for the remaining territories expired at the end of march 2004 the expiration of rand’s distribution rights has not had a material effect on our operating results as the customers formerly serviced by rand may now be serviced by ptc directly or by other ptc resellers we are also currently involved in a lawsuit with rand as described in part i item 3 “legal proceedings”  

  

collaboration and control solutions revenue 

  

the following table illustrates trends from 2002 to 2004 in our collaboration and control solutions software license revenue and service revenue 

  

   

total revenue from our collaboration and control solutions software and related services was 27 26 and 24 of our total revenue in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively 

  

collaboration and control solutions license revenue grew 3 in 2004 compared to 2003 after having decreased 7 in 2003 compared to 2002 although we are encouraged by this recent performance particularly in the second part of 2004 the plm market is still in its early stages and we continue to observe reluctance on the part of our customers to consummate large software purchases particularly in this evolving market further we have seen an ongoing trend of customers purchasing plm solutions in incremental fashion and have continued to see sales shift from enterpriselevel windchill modules to our windchill link solutions we feel that we have addressed this evolving customer demand with our windchill link solutions described below as well as with our product development system adoption roadmap which provides customers with a suggested approach for purchasing and implementing our solutions in stages 

  

the increase in collaboration and control solutions maintenance revenue for all periods presented is attributable to a growing user base of our windchill solutions and the introduction of our flex 3c package in 2003 which includes windchill software other service revenues have been adversely affected by the removal of a portion of our delivery capacity in connection with our cost reductions 

  

to improve our ability to provide plm solutions to a broader range of customers to complement our enterprise offerings and to meet evolving customer demand we have introduced windchillbased solutions targeted at specific businesscritical plm processes our windchill link solutions in 2004 2003 and 2002 windchill link solutions license revenue was 297 million 299 million and 114 million respectively which represented 50 52 and 18 respectively of our collaboration and control license revenue we expect that our windchill link solutions will continue to gain acceptance with existing and new customers and that they will comprise a large portion of our overall windchill license revenue we believe these solutions address a growing customer demand for better return on investment as they can be implemented in incremental fashion as the requirements of our customers and the general market change we plan periodically to evaluate the need for additional solutions 

  

in addition to these product changes we also have begun to expand our distribution of our plm solutions by recently offering a limited number of qualified resellers the ability to sell our windchill link solutions as well as related services in 2004 we also completed the acquisition of ohio design automation inc a developer of collaboration solutions for electronics design this acquisition will allow us to better serve the high technology and electronics industries by providing the technology necessary to offer an integrated solution enabling the dynamic management of both mechanical and electrical design information we have begun to integrate ohio design automation’s technology into the windchill product line for future release while continuing to offer the technology on a standalone basis ohio design automation’s revenues on a historic standalone basis were not significant 

  

design solutions revenue 

  

the following table illustrates trends from 2002 to 2004 in our design solutions software license revenue and service revenue 

  

   

total revenue from our design solutions and related services was 73 74 and 76 of our total revenue in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively compared to the prior year design solutions license revenue reflects an increase in software unit sales of 12 in 2004 and a decline in software unit sales of 9 in 2003 and reflects decreases in the average selling price per seat of 16 in 2004 and 10 in 2003 the 2004 increase in unit sales or seats and decrease in the average selling price per seat are attributable in part to a higher mix of lowerend software packages being sold due to growing acceptance of proengineer wildfire in the lowend of the mechanical computeraided design market as well as to an increased mix of sales completed by resellers for which we receive lower revenue per seat the decrease in design solutions total service revenue is due in large part to the lag effect of license revenue declines in prior periods and also has been adversely affected by the removal of a portion of our services delivery capacity in connection with our cost reductions 

  

while we have experienced fluctuations in our design solutions revenue quarter to quarter overall we are cautiously optimistic that with the introduction of proengineer wildfire discussed further below our design solutions revenue has begun to stabilize however in light of the unfavorable market conditions described below future revenue trends for our design solutions and related services remain uncertain 

  

design solutions revenue continues to be adversely affected by i the relative maturity and saturation of the north american and european markets ii the difficulty associated with displacing incumbent product design systems in the discrete market for computeraided design solutions iii increased competition and price pressure from products offering more limited functionality at lower cost and iv weakness in technology spending in the global manufacturing economy which has led to a decline in largedollar license transactions the decrease in our design solutions revenue during 2003 compared to 2002 also reflects the sale of our icem surfacing business in the fourth quarter of 2002 the icem business had contributed revenue of 112 million in 2002 

  

to address the decline in our design solutions revenue we have introduced design solutions packages that have price points functionality and easeofuse features that appeal to a broader spectrum of design solution users proengineer wildfire released in february 2003 and updated with proengineer wildfire 20 in may 2004 supports internet interfaces and windchillbased interfaces and provides customers with the opportunity to integrate more readily traditional design solutions with collaboration and control solutions the product’s user interface makes it more competitive with lowerend modeling tools on the market that are known for easeofuse while maintaining the powerful functionality of proengineer the new internet interface which is unique to proengineer offers a differentiated design solution to manufacturing companies looking for a complete product development system all proengineer customers on an active maintenance plan received proengineer wildfire as a maintenance release consistent with their current configurations and we attribute our recent growth in design solutions maintenance revenue in part to the success of proengineer wildfire among existing customers we also offer various technology and service upgrade packages allowing customers to purchase upgrades from their existing product configuration to the full suite of proengineer wildfire functionality 

  

costs and expenses 

  

over the past several years we have made significant investments needed to transform our business from providing a single line of technical software with a direct distribution model to providing a family of enterprise solutions with an expanded channel 

  

and partnerinvolved distribution model we undertook to reduce our cost structure after completing a significant portion of this transformation and we believe we will be able to maintain product quality and customer satisfaction even with our reduced cost structure all cost and expense categories in 2004 2003 and 2002 were impacted by restructuring actions taken in those periods the following table illustrates trends from 2002 to 2004 in our costs and expenses 

  

    

compared to the prior year total costs and expenses decreased 1290 million and 689 million in 2004 and 2003 respectively primarily as a result of our restructuring plan initiated in 2003 and completed in the fourth quarter of 2004 to achieve our objective of restoring profitability we implemented cost cutting measures that reduced our headcount resulting in lower aggregate salaries benefits and related costs as a result our headcount has decreased over the last three years to 3042 3500 and 3803 at the end of 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively in addition our cost reduction initiatives resulted in reduced facility charges including rent and related overhead costs primarily as a result of headcount reductions and lease costs related to excess facilities we recorded restructuring and other charges of 429 million 309 million and 312 million in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively see “ restructuring and other charges ” below and note b of “notes to consolidated financial statements” for further discussion 

  

the decrease in costs and expenses in 2003 from 2002 was also due to lower amortization of goodwill and certain intangible assets as a result of the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  and lower variable expenses resulting from lower revenues 

  

cost of license revenue 

  

our cost of license revenue consists of fixed and variable costs associated with reproducing and distributing software and documentation as well as royalties owed to third parties for technology embedded in or licensed with our software products cost of license revenue as a percentage of license revenue was 4 for 2004 5 for 2003 and 7 for 2002 cost of license revenue as a percent of license revenue can vary depending on product mix sold and the effect of fixed and variable royalties in relation to the level of license revenue the decrease in cost of license revenue in 2004 and 2003 compared to the prior periods was primarily due to lower royalty costs of approximately 22 million and 44 million respectively resulting primarily from lower revenue 

  

cost of service revenue 

  

our cost of service revenue includes costs associated with training customer support and consulting personnel such as salaries benefits and travel thirdparty subcontractor fees costs associated with the release of maintenance updates including related royalty costs and facility costs cost of service revenue as a percentage of service revenue was 38 in 2004 44 in 2003 and 40 in 2002 the decreased cost of service revenue in 2004 compared to prior periods is due primarily to our removal of a portion of our services delivery headcount service revenue margins improved in 2004 from 2003 primarily due to this reduction in servicerelated employee headcount reducing headcount in our services organization by 17 at the end of 2004 as compared to the end of 2003 and resulting in a 169 million reduction in compensation benefit and travel costs in addition royalty costs were 

  

115 million lower in 2004 than in 2003 primarily as a result of a contract renegotiation finalized in the second quarter of 2004 resulting in a onetime benefit of 50 million from the reversal of an accrual established in the fourth quarter of 2003 compared to 2002 service revenue margins in 2003 declined due to lower revenue and higher cost of service expense including the fourth quarter 2003 accrual referred to above partially offset by a 6 decrease in servicerelated employee headcount at the end of 2003 compared to the end of 2002 

  

sales and marketing 

  

our sales and marketing expenses primarily include salaries and benefits sales commissions advertising and marketing programs travel and facility costs sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenue were 34 44 and 45 for 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively total sales and marketing employee headcount decreased 15 at the end of 2004 and 18 at the end of 2003 compared to the prior year at the end of 2004 2003 and 2002 sales and marketing headcount was 945 1114 and 1358 respectively compared to the prior year total sales and marketing expenses decreased 24 in 2004 and 10 in 2003 primarily as a result of the headcount reductions as well as to reductions in marketing program costs which compared to the prior period were 84 million and 62 million lower in 2004 and 2003 respectively in addition sales commissions were lower by approximately 101 million in 2003 compared to 2002 due to lower license and service revenue 

  

research and development 

  

our research and development expenses consist principally of salaries and benefits costs of computer equipment and facility expenses major activities of this organization include developing new releases of our software that work together in a more integral fashion and that include functionality enhancements desired by our customers research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenue were 16 19 and 19 in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively compared to the prior year research and development expenses decreased 16 in 2004 and decreased 6 in 2003 the decrease in 2004 and 2003 from the prior periods is due primarily to shifting certain development activities to our existing facilities in india where overall research and development costs are lower to lower depreciation and telecommunication costs and in 2004 to cost reductions from our restructuring plan completed in that year which resulted in a 10 lower headcount at the end of 2004 compared to the end of 2003 

  

general and administrative 

  

our general and administrative expenses include the costs of our corporate finance information technology human resources and administrative functions as well as bad debt expense general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue were 9 10 and 9 for 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively compared to the prior year these costs decreased 16 in 2004 and increased 3 in 2003 the decrease in 2004 is primarily due to a 7 reduction in headcount as well as lower depreciation bad debt expense and insurance costs the decreases were partially offset by an increase in compensation expense associated with incentive plan bonuses for which targets were met in 2004 the increase in 2003 is primarily related to increased insurance costs and investments in information technology systems as well as an increase in bad debt expense bad debt expense in 2004 2003 and 2002 was 31 million 51 million and 43 million respectively 

  

amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets 

  

amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets totaled 52 million 59 million and 358 million in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively these costs represent the amortization of acquired intangible assets including developed technology and customer lists and for intangible assets acquired prior to october 1 2002 these costs also include the amortization of goodwill trademarks and assembled workforce in july 2001 the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas no 142 requires that effective october 1 2002 ratable amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives be replaced with periodic impairment tests of those assets and that certain intangible assets other than goodwill be amortized over their useful lives in accordance with sfas no 142 beginning october 1 2002 we no longer amortize goodwill and certain intangible assets with an indefinite useful life including acquired trademarks as a result amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets decreased 299 million in 2003 compared to 2002 for a further discussion see critical accounting policies— valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets below and note d of “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

  

in the third quarter of 2004 we completed the acquisition of ohio design automation inc for 98 million in cash ohio design automation develops collaboration solutions for electronics design the purchase price was allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on our estimates of fair value the values assigned included intangible assets of 18 million for customer lists and 16 million for purchased software which are being amortized over estimated useful lives of 5 years and 3 years respectively the excess purchase price over the amounts allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed of 70 million was recorded as goodwill upon the fulfillment of certain specified conditions an additional 2 million related to the acquisition will be paid through april 2007 any such contingent payments will be recorded as operating expenses as incurred 

  

restructuring and other charges 

  

in 2004 2003 and 2002 we recorded restructuring and other charges of 429 million 309 million and 312 million respectively primarily associated with reductions in workforce and excess facility obligations to reduce our cost structure and to improve profitability during those same periods we made cash payments related to restructuring and other charges of 406 million 244 million and 425 million respectively amounts not yet paid at september 30 2004 related to restructuring and other charges taken during the current and all prior periods were 433 million and primarily relate to excess facility obligations to be paid out through 2014 of the total amount accrued at september 30 2004 we expect to pay approximately 12 million within the next twelve months 

  

in 2004 we recorded restructuring and other charges of 210 million for severance and termination benefits related to 459 employees terminated during 2004 and 219 million related primarily to excess facilities the charges for excess facilities are primarily related to gross lease commitments in excess of estimated sublease income for excess facilities of the total restructuring and other charges recorded in 2004 19 million was noncash for the writeoff of leasehold improvements related to the excess facilities this restructuring program was completed in the fourth quarter of 2004 

  

in 2003 we recorded restructuring charges of 179 million for severance and termination benefits related to 361 employees terminated during 2003 we also recorded charges of 116 million related to excess facilities and 14 million of other costs primarily related to the writeoff of acquired technology the increases in the liability for excess facilities in 2003 related primarily to revised estimates of gross lease commitments in excess of expected sublease income for leases assumed in our 1998 acquisition of computervision corporation as well as to consolidating existing leased facilities 

  

in 2002 we recorded restructuring and other charges of 173 million for severance and termination benefits related to approximately 310 employees who were notified or terminated during 2002 and 139 million related to excess facilities the excess facilities charge was primarily comprised of an increase to computervision lease liabilities for existing excess facilities necessitated by changing real estate market conditions and related actions taken by several subtenants 

  

interest income 

  

interest income relates to earnings on the investment of our excess cash balances in various financial instruments and totaled 35 million 33 million and 41 million in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively the modest increase in interest income in 2004 compared to 2003 was due to earnings on higher average cash balances at lower interest rates in 2004 than in 2003 the 20 decrease in interest income in 2003 compared to 2002 resulted primarily from lower investment returns and declines in average investment balances 

  

other expense net 

  

other expense net includes costs of hedging contracts certain realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains or losses charges incurred in connection with financing customer contracts writedowns of investments and foreign exchange gains or losses resulting from the required periodend currency remeasurement of the financial statements of our subsidiaries that use the us dollar as their functional currency a large portion of our revenue and expenses is transacted in foreign currencies to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates we engage in hedging transactions involving the use of foreign currency forward contracts and from time to time foreign currency option contracts primarily in the euro and in asian currencies other expense net totaled 39 million 61 million and 86 million in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively the 36 decrease in other expense net in 2004 compared to 2003 was due primarily to lower charges in connection with financing customer contracts which 

  

were 21 million in 2004 compared to 39 million in 2003 the 30 decrease in other expense net in 2003 compared to 2002 was due primarily to lower costs of foreign currency hedging see item 7a below and note a of “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

  

gain on sale of a business 

  

in the fourth quarter of 2002 we completed the sale of our icem surfacing business for 102 million in cash resulting in a pretax gain of 87 million 

  

income taxes 

  

our effective tax rate was 6 on pretax income of 370 million in 2004 19 on a pretax loss of 824 million in 2003 and 26 on a pretax loss of 743 million in 2002 the difference between the statutory federal income tax rate of 35 and the effective tax rate of 6 in 2004 was due primarily to an 189 million onetime tax benefit related to the us federal income tax refund described below partially offset by us operating losses that could not be benefited and to taxes payable in certain foreign jurisdictions the difference between the statutory federal income tax rate benefit of 35 and the effective tax rate provision of 19 in 2003 was due primarily to us operating losses that could not be benefited and to taxes payable in certain foreign jurisdictions the difference between the statutory federal income tax rate benefit of 35 and the effective tax rate provision of 26 in 2002 was due primarily to the increase in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets discussed below and nondeductible acquisitionrelated amortization costs offset by a benefit due to the sale of the icem business as a result of operating losses incurred in recent years and uncertainty as to the extent and timing of profitability in future periods in 2002 we increased our valuation allowance for our remaining net deferred tax assets by approximately 480 million through the provision for income taxes due to the uncertainty regarding the realizability of deferred tax assets see critical accounting policies below and note e of “notes to consolidated financial statements” in 2004 and 2003 we further increased our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to match the increase in deferred tax assets primarily related to us operating losses 

  

in the normal course of business ptc and its subsidiaries are examined by various taxing authorities including the internal revenue service irs in the united states in fiscal 2004 the irs concluded its examination of our income tax returns for fiscal years 1998 through 2000 resulting in a tax refund including interest to us of 395 million notification of the refund amount was received in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the refund was received in the first quarter of 2005 the refund resulted in a nonrecurring tax benefit of 189 million in 2004 at september 30 2004 and 2003 income taxes receivable included expected refunds of us federal income taxes and related interest totaling 395 million and 233 million respectively 

  

critical accounting policies 

  

we have prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america in preparing our financial statements we make estimates assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our reported revenues results from operations and net income loss as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet these estimates assumptions and judgments about future events and their effects on our results cannot be determined with certainty and are made based on our historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances these estimates may change as new events occur or additional information is obtained and we may periodically be faced with uncertainties the outcomes of which are not within our control and may not be known for a prolonged period of time while there are a number of accounting policies methods and estimates affecting our financial statements described in note a of “notes to consolidated financial statements” the areas that are our most important critical accounting policies include revenue recognition valuation of goodwill and intangible assets accounting for income taxes allowance for accounts and other receivables restructuring charges and transfers of financial assets these areas are described below a critical accounting policy is one that is both material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires us to make difficult subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate and different estimates that we could have used or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process actual results could differ from those estimates 

  

accounting policies guidelines and interpretations related to our critical accounting policies are generally subject to numerous sources of authoritative guidance and are often reexamined by accounting standards rule makers and regulators these rule makers andor regulators may promulgate interpretations guidance or regulations that may result in changes to our accounting policies which could result in a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 

  

revenue recognition 

  

while we apply the guidance of statement of position sop no 972 software revenue recognition and statement of position no 989 modification of sop 972 software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions both issued by the american institute of certified public accountants as well as sec staff accounting bulletin 104 revenue recognition we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amounts of software license and services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period our primary judgments involve the following 

  

   

   

   

   

we derive revenues from three primary sources 1 software licenses 2 maintenance services and 3 other services which include consulting and education services revenue by type for 2004 2003 and 2002 was as follows 

  

   

for software license arrangements that do not require significant modification or customization of the underlying software we recognize revenue when 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 2 delivery has occurred generally fob shipping point or electronic distribution 3 the fee is fixed or determinable and 4 collection is probable substantially all of our license revenues are recognized in this manner 

  

our software is distributed primarily through our direct sales force however our indirect distribution channel continues to expand through alliances with resellers revenue arrangements with resellers are recognized on a sellthrough basis that is when we receive persuasive evidence that the reseller has sold the products to an enduser customer we do not offer contractual rights of return stock balancing or price protection to our resellers and actual product returns from them have been insignificant to date as a result we do not maintain reserves for product returns and related allowances 

  

at the time of each sale transaction we must make an assessment of the collectibility of the amount due from the customer revenue is only recognized at that time if management deems that collection is probable in making this assessment we consider customer creditworthiness and historical payment experience at that same time we assess whether fees are fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties if the fee is not fixed or determinable revenue is recognized only as payments become due from the customer provided that all other revenue recognition criteria are met in assessing whether the fee is fixed or determinable we consider the payment terms of the transaction and our collection experience in similar transactions without making concessions among other factors our software license arrangements generally do not include customer acceptance provisions however if an arrangement includes an acceptance provision we record revenue only upon the earlier of 1 receipt of written acceptance from the customer or 2 expiration of the acceptance period 

  

our software arrangements often include implementation and consulting services that are sold separately under consulting engagement contracts or as part of the software license arrangement when we determine that such services are not essential to the functionality of the licensed software and qualify as “service transactions” under sop 972 we record revenue separately for the license and service elements of these arrangements generally we consider that a service is not essential to the functionality of the software based on various factors including if the services may be provided by independent third parties experienced in providing such consulting and implementation in coordination with dedicated customer personnel if an arrangement does not qualify for separate accounting of the license and service elements then license revenue is recognized together with the consulting services using either the percentageofcompletion or completedcontract method of contract accounting contract accounting is also applied to any software arrangements that include customerspecific acceptance criteria or where the license payment is tied to the performance of consulting services under the percentageofcompletion method we estimate the stage of completion of contracts with fixed or “not to exceed” fees based on hours or costs incurred to date as compared with estimated total project hours or costs at completion if we do not have a sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion revenue is recognized upon completion of the contract when total cost estimates exceed revenues we accrue for the estimated losses immediately the use of the percentageofcompletion method of accounting requires significant judgment relative to estimating total contract costs including assumptions relative to the length of time to complete the project the nature and complexity of the work to be performed and anticipated changes in salaries and other costs when adjustments in estimated contract costs are determined such revisions may have the effect of adjusting in the current period the earnings applicable to performance in prior periods 

  

we generally use the residual method to recognize revenues from arrangements that include one or more elements to be delivered at a future date when evidence of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists under the residual method the fair value of the undelivered elements eg maintenance consulting and education services based on vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements ie software license if evidence of the fair value of one or more of the undelivered services does not exist all revenues are deferred and recognized when delivery of all of those services has occurred or when fair values can be established we determine vsoe of the fair value of services revenues based upon our recent pricing for those services when sold separately vsoe of the fair value of maintenance services may also be determined based on a substantive maintenance renewal clause if any within a customer contract our current pricing practices are influenced primarily by product type purchase volume maintenance term and customer location we review services revenues sold separately and maintenance renewal rates on a periodic basis and update when appropriate our vsoe of fair value for such services to ensure that it reflects our recent pricing experience 

  

valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets 

  

our net goodwill and other intangible assets totaled 565 million and 519 million as of september 30 2004 and 2003 respectively we assess the impairment of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets on at least an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business significant negative industry or economic trends a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period or a reduction of our market capitalization relative to net book value 

  

the goodwill impairment test prescribed by sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires us to identify reporting units and to determine estimates of the fair values of our reporting units as of the date we test for impairment as described in note l of “notes to consolidated financial statements” we have two reporting units 1 our software products reportable segment and 2 our services reportable segment all goodwill is attributable to our software products reportable segment to conduct these tests of goodwill the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value if the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeded its fair value we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value of goodwill and its fair value we estimate the fair values of our reporting units using discounted cash flow valuation models those models require estimates of future revenues profits capital expenditures and working capital for each unit we estimate these amounts by evaluating historical trends current budgets operating plans and industry data we conduct our annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite lived assets as of the end of the third quarter of each fiscal year we completed our annual impairment review as of the end of the third quarter of 2004 and concluded that as of july 3 2004 no impairment charge was required there have not been any events or changes in circumstances since july 3 2004 that indicate that the carrying values of goodwill or other intangible assets may not be recoverable there can be no assurance that at the time subsequent impairment 

  

reviews are completed an impairment charge will not be recorded in light of the factors described above if a charge were deemed necessary in the future it would directly affect net income loss for the period in which the charge was taken 

  

for longlived assets and identifiable intangible assets other than goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets we reassess the recoverability of the asset based on projected undiscounted future cash flows over the asset’s remaining life if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reportable segment below its carrying value when the carrying value of the asset exceeds its undiscounted cash flows we record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset determined using projected discounted future cash flows of the asset determining the fair value of individual assets and goodwill includes significant judgment by management different judgments could yield different results 

  

accounting for income taxes 

  

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to calculate our income tax expense based on taxable income by jurisdiction there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenuesharing and costreimbursement arrangements among related entities and the differing tax treatment of revenue and cost items across various jurisdictions if a foreign jurisdiction were to determine that our cost reimbursement arrangements need revision that determination could affect our tax liability 

  

the income tax accounting process also involves estimating our actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheet we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized we must establish a valuation allowance as a charge to income tax expense in 2002 we increased our deferred tax valuation allowance and recorded a corresponding 480 million charge to income tax expense and in 2004 and 2003 we have fully reserved for additional deferred tax assets primarily related to net operating loss carryforwards generated the decision to record the valuation allowance required significant management judgment had we not recorded this valuation allowance we would have reported materially different results if the realization of deferred tax assets in the future is considered more likely than not a reduction in the valuation allowance would increase net income in the period such determination is made net deferred tax liabilities at september 30 2004 were 11 million comprised of deferred tax assets of 1644 million a valuation allowance of 1420 million and deferred tax liabilities of 235 million our deferred tax assets consist primarily of net operating loss carryforwards 

  

allowance for accounts and other receivables 

  

management judgment is required in assessing the collectibility of customer accounts and other receivables for which we generally do not require collateral we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments in determining the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts management specifically analyzes individual accounts receivable historical bad debts customer concentrations customer creditworthiness current economic conditions accounts receivable aging trends and changes in our customer payment terms the following table summarizes our accounts receivable and related reserve balances as of september 30 2004 and september 30 2003 

  

   

if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate additional allowances might be required resulting in future operating expenses that are not included in the allowance for doubtful accounts our customer base consists of large numbers of geographically diverse customers dispersed across many industries and no individual customer comprised more than 10 of our net trade accounts receivable for any period presented 

  

restructuring charges 

  

we periodically record restructuring charges resulting from restructuring our operations including consolidations andor relocations of operations changes in our strategic plan or managerial responses to declines in demand increasing costs or other environmental factors the determination of restructuring charges requires management judgment and may include costs related to employee benefits such as costs of severance and termination benefits and estimates of costs for future lease commitments on excess facilities net of estimated future sublease income in determining the amount of the facilities charge we are required to estimate such factors as future vacancy rates the time required to sublet properties and sublease rates these estimates will be reviewed quarterly based on known real estate market conditions and the credit worthiness of subtenants and may result in revisions to established facility reserves we have accrued 417 million as of september 30 2004 compared to 368 million at september 30 2003 related to excess facilities representing gross lease commitments with agreements expiring at various dates through 2014 of approximately 789 million net of committed and estimated sublease income of approximately 351 million and a present value factor of 21 million we have entered into signed sublease arrangements for approximately 240 million with the remaining 111 million based on future estimated sublease arrangements including 78 million for space currently available for sublease if our sublease assumptions prove to be inaccurate we may need to make changes in these estimates that would affect our results of operations and potentially our financial condition 

  

transfers of financial assets 

  

we offer our customers the option to purchase software and services through payment plans we may transfer future payments under certain of these contracts to thirdparty financial institutions on a nonrecourse basis we record such transfers as sales of the related accounts receivable when we surrender control of such receivables under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 140 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

   

our operating activities the proceeds from our issuance of stock under stock plans and existing cash and cash equivalents provided sufficient resources to fund our employee base capital asset needs stock repurchases acquisitions and financing needs in all years presented 

  

as of september 30 2004 cash and cash equivalents totaled 2949 million up from 2053 million at september 30 2003 we invest our cash with highly rated financial institutions and in diversified domestic and international money market mutual funds the portfolio is invested in shortterm instruments to ensure cash is available to meet requirements as needed the increase in cash and cash equivalents during 2004 consisted primarily of 1013 million provided by operations and 97 million provided by net proceeds from the issuance of common stock partially offset by 124 million for capital additions to property equipment and intangible assets and 98 million for an acquisition of a business 

  

cash provided by operations was 1013 million in 2004 compared to 65 million in 2003 and cash used in operations of 226 million in 2002 the higher cash provided by operations in 2004 as compared to 2003 was due primarily to 1 improved profitability in 2004 versus 2003 net income increased 1331 million in 2004 to 348 million from a net loss of 983 million in 2003 2 an increase in deferred revenue of 13 million in 2004 compared to a decrease in deferred revenue of 367 million in 2003 and 3 pension contributions of 27 million in 2004 compared to 107 million in 2003 partially offset by a net tax 

  

payments of 57 million in 2004 compared to 533 million in net refunds in 2003 and b cash expenditures for restructuring and other charges of 406 million in 2004 compared to 244 million in 2003 days sales outstanding in accounts receivable improved to 69 days at the end of 2004 from 77 days at the end of 2003 and 76 days at the end of 2002 

  

the higher cash provided by operations in 2003 as compared to 2002 was due primarily to 1 net tax refunds totaling 533 million received in 2003 compared to 35 million received in 2002 and 2 reduced cash expenditures to fund restructuring initiatives of 244 million in 2003 compared to 425 million in 2002 partially offset by a pension contributions of 107 million in 2003 compared to 41 million in 2002 and b net losses before depreciation amortization and other noncash charges of 483 million in 2003 compared to 243 million in 2002 in 2003 we also generated approximately 142 million from the sale of shortterm accounts receivable on a nonrecourse basis to a thirdparty financial institution as a means of accelerating cash collections which was more costeffective than offering prompt payment discounts 

  

cash and cash equivalents used provided by investing activities was 223 million in 2004 compared to 55 million in 2003 and 214 million in 2002 cash used for additions to property equipment and intangible assets was 124 million 259 million and 317 million in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively cash used for additions to property equipment and intangible assets has decreased due to the completion of our investment in a new erp system in 2003 and also due to lower capital requirements as a result of our restructuring plan initiated in 2003 and completed in 2004 which reduced the number of our operating facilities and employee headcount our expenditures for property and equipment consist primarily of computer equipment software office equipment and facility improvements in 2004 we had cash expenditures of 98 million for the acquisition of a business and in 2002 we had cash proceeds of 102 million from the sale of business in 2003 we received net proceeds from sales and maturities of investments of 314 million as we moved our investment portfolio to shortterm securities to minimize interest rate risk 

  

cash provided by financing activities was 97 million in 2004 75 million in 2003 and 36 million in 2002 the increase in 2004 compared to 2003 was due primarily to higher proceeds from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans the increase in 2003 compared to 2002 was due to lower stock repurchases in 2003 partially offset by lower proceeds from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans cash proceeds from the issuance of our common stock under our stock plans were 97 million 77 million and 86 million in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively in september 1998 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 200 million shares of our common stock and in july 2000 increased the shares authorized for repurchase to 400 million in 2003 and 2002 we used cash to repurchase 02 million and 50 million respectively of our common stock there were no repurchases in 2004 since 1998 and through september 30 2004 we repurchased at a cost of 3668 million a total of 312 million shares of the 400 million shares so authorized in 2002 135 million shares of treasury stock were retired and restored to the status of authorized but unissued shares all shares of our common stock repurchased in the future if any shall automatically be restored to the status of authorized and unissued shares 

  

we believe that existing cash and cash equivalents together with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements through at least the next twelve months in the first quarter of 2005 we received a us federal income tax refund of 395 million during 2005 we expect to make cash disbursements estimated at 12 million for restructuring charges incurred in 2004 and prior periods capital expenditures for 2005 are currently anticipated to be approximately 15 million our cash position could be adversely affected if we are not able to continue to generate operating profits 

  

we have evaluated and expect to continue to evaluate possible acquisition transactions and possible dispositions of certain businesses on an ongoing basis and at any given time may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to possible acquisitions or dispositions our cash position could be reduced and we may incur debt obligations to the extent we complete any significant acquisitions 

  

contractual obligations 

  

we lease office facilities and certain equipment under operating leases that expire at various dates through 2014 including an operating lease agreement related to our headquarters office in needham massachusetts entered into in 2000 which expires in 

  

december 2012 subject to certain renewal rights these leases qualify for operating lease accounting treatment and as such are not included on our balance sheet at september 30 2004 our contractual obligations including future minimum lease payments net of sublease income under noncancellable operating leases are as follows 

  

      

as of september 30 2004 we have letters of credit outstanding of approximately 64 million primarily related to the lease of our headquarters in needham massachusetts 

  

new accounting pronouncements 

  

in accordance with recently issued accounting pronouncements we will be required to comply with certain changes in accounting rules and regulations see note a of “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

  

important factors that may affect future results 

  

the following are some of the factors that could affect our future results they should be considered in connection with evaluating forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report on form 10k and otherwise made by us or on our behalf because these factors could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in forwardlooking statements 

  

i operational considerations 

  

our operating results fluctuate within each quarter and from quarter to quarter making our future revenues and operating results difficult to predict 

  

while our sales cycle varies substantially from customer to customer a high percentage of our revenue has historically been generated in the third month of each fiscal quarter and this revenue tends to be concentrated in the later part of that month our orders early in a quarter will not generally occur at a rate which if sustained throughout the quarter would be sufficient to assure that we will meet our revenue targets for any particular quarter moreover our transition from a oneproduct company to a multiproduct company our increased utilization of indirect distribution channels through alliances with resellers and other strategic partners and our shift in business emphasis to offering a product development system comprised of components that can be 

  

purchased in stages have resulted in more unpredictable and often longer sales cycles for products and services accordingly our quarterly results may be difficult to predict prior to the end of the quarter any inability to obtain large orders or orders in large volumes or to make shipments or perform services in the period immediately preceding the end of any particular quarter may cause the results for that quarter to fall short of our revenue targets in addition our operating expenses are based on expected future revenue and are largely fixed for the short term as a result a revenue shortfall in any quarter could cause our earnings for that quarter to fall below expectations as well any failure to meet our quarterly revenue or earnings targets could adversely impact the market price of our stock 

  

other factors that may cause quartertoquarter revenue and earnings fluctuations or that may affect our ability to make quarter end shipments include the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

in addition the levels of quarterly or annual software or service revenue in general or for particular geographic areas may not be comparable to those achieved in previous periods 

  

general economic and political conditions may impact our results 

  

our revenue growth and profitability depends on the overall demand for software and related services this demand has been adversely affected by unfavorable economic conditions as customers have reduced or are deferring spending on information technology improvements which in turn has affected our operating results if the recent unfavorable economic conditions continue the economic slowdown has the potential to continue to materially and adversely affect us 

  

politicalsocial events in recent years such as the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome and concerns regarding terrorism have the potential to put further pressure on economic conditions both domestically and internationally the potential turmoil that may result from such events contributes to the uncertainty of the economic climate the impact of these or future similar conditions may have a materially adverse impact on our business operating results and financial position 

  

we utilize third parties such as resellers and other strategic partners for the distribution and implementation of our software solutions which makes it more difficult to manage the sales process 

  

we have entered into relationships with groups of geographically dispersed resellers and other strategic partners to promote sell andor implement our products which can result in a reduction in our control over the sales process and the delivery of services to our customers the successful utilization of third parties will depend on 

  

   

   

   

we may not be able to implement new initiatives successfully 

  

part of our success in the past has resulted from our ability to implement new initiatives including new product introductions technology acquisitions and organizational changes our future operating results will continue to depend upon 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

we are dependent on key personnel whose loss could cause delays in our product development and sales efforts 

  

our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical managerial and sales personnel competition for such personnel in the high technology industry is intense we assume that we will continue to be able to attract and retain such personnel the failure to do so however could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

we must continually modify and enhance our products to keep pace with changing technology and we may experience delays in developing and debugging our software 

  

we must continually modify and enhance our products to keep pace with changes in computer software hardware and database technology as well as emerging internet standards we must also continually expend efforts to review and fix errors “bugs” found in our current and upcoming software releases our ability to remain competitive will depend on our ability to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

also as is common in the computer software industry we may from time to time experience delays in our product development and “debugging” efforts our performance could be hurt by significant delays in developing completing or shipping new or enhanced products moreover if significant bugs were found in our software products we may be impacted by negative customer reaction and could experience delays in our new product development efforts as development resources may need to be shifted toward our debugging efforts among other things such delays could cause us to incorrectly predict the fiscal quarter in which we will realize revenue from the shipment of the new or enhanced products and give our competitors a greater opportunity to market competing products 

  

we may be unable to price our products competitively or distribute them effectively 

  

our success is tied to our ability to price our products and services competitively and to deliver them efficiently including our ability to 

  

   

   

   

we may be adversely affected by a decline in demand for plm solutions 

  

we currently derive our license and service revenues from a group of related plm software products and services and we expect this to continue into the future as a result factors affecting the demand for plm software solutions or pricing pressures on this single category could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

  

we depend on sales within the discrete manufacturing market 

  

a large amount of our revenues are related to sales to customers in the discrete manufacturing sector a decline in spending in this sector could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

  

we depend on sales from outside the united states that could be adversely affected by changes in the international markets 

  

a significant portion of our business comes from outside the united states accordingly our performance could be adversely affected by economic downturns in europe or the asiapacific region another consequence of significant international business is that a large percentage of our revenues and expenses is denominated in foreign currencies that fluctuate in value although we may from time to time enter into foreign exchange forward contracts andor foreign exchange option contracts to offset a portion of the foreign exchange fluctuations unanticipated events may have a material impact on our results other risks associated with international business include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

we may not be able to obtain copyright or patent protection for the software products we develop or our other trademarks 

  

our software products and our other trademarks including our company names product names and logos are proprietary we protect our intellectual property rights in these items by relying on copyrights trademarks patents and common law safeguards including trade secret protection as well as restrictions on disclosures and transferability contained in our agreements with other parties despite these measures there can be no assurance that the laws of all relevant jurisdictions will afford adequate protection to our products and other intellectual property the software industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding copyright patent and other intellectual property rights while we have not to date had any significant claims of this type asserted against us there can be no assurance that someone will not assert such claims against us with respect to existing or future products or other intellectual property or that if asserted we would prevail in such claims in the event a lawsuit of this type is filed it could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel whether or not we ultimately prevail certain of our products also contain technology developed and licensed from third parties we may likewise be susceptible to infringement claims with respect to these thirdparty technologies 

  

ii design solutions related considerations 

  

increasing competition in the computer aided design marketplace may reduce our revenues 

  

there are an increasing number of competitive design products some of which emphasize lower price points and ease of use compared to the more robust functionality of our solutions this increased competition makes attracting new customers more difficult in addition some competitive products have reached a level of functionality whereby product differentiation is less likely in and of itself to dislodge incumbent design systems given the training data conversion and other startup costs associated with system replacement we recently have introduced proengineer wildfire which focuses on plm interoperability and easeofuse although proengineer wildfire and other initiatives are designed to address these competitive pressures increased competition and further market acceptance of competitive products could have a negative effect on pricing and revenue for our products which could have a material adverse affect on our results 

  

in addition our design software is capable of performing on a variety of platforms several of our competitors focus on single platform applications particularly windowsbased platforms there can be no assurance that we will have a competitive advantage with multiple platform applications 

  

we continue to enhance our existing product line by releasing updates as well as new productsmodules our competitive position and operating results could suffer if 

  

   

   

   

   

growth in the computer aided design solutions industry has slowed 

  

growth in certain segments of the computer aided design solutions industry has slowed and coupled with decreased functional differentiation among flexible engineering tools may adversely affect our ability to penetrate the market for new customers and recapture our market share over the long term we believe our emphasis on plm solutions will allow us to differentiate our design solutions from the competition and stabilize sales of our design solutions products while we seek to increase sales of our collaboration and control solutions however the strategy may not be successful or may take longer than we plan there could be a material adverse affect on our operating results in any quarter if these assumptions prove to be incorrect 

  

iii collaboration and control solutions and overall plm related considerations 

  

we are attempting to capitalize on a market opportunity known as product lifecycle management plm it may be that our assumptions about this market opportunity are wrong which could adversely affect our results 

  

we have identified plm as a new market opportunity for us and have devoted significant resources toward capitalizing on that opportunity our collaboration and control solutions together with our design solutions allow us to offer a suite of plm 

  

solutions and related services targeted at this market this suite includes software and services that utilize internet technologies to permit our customers’ employees suppliers and customers to collaboratively develop build distribute and manage products throughout their entire lifecycle because the market for software products that allow companies to collaborate on product information on an enterprisewide level is newly emerging we cannot be certain as to the size of this market whether it will grow or whether companies will elect to utilize our products or acquire them from other sources or forego plm initiatives altogether 

  

in addition companies that have already invested substantial resources in other methods of sharing product information in the designthroughmanufacture process may be reluctant to adopt a new approach that may replace limit or compete with their existing systems or methods we expect that we will continue to need to educate prospective customers about the uses and benefits of our products demand for and market acceptance of our products will be affected by the success of those efforts 

  

our windchill technology which is central to our plm strategy is not yet well established in the marketplace 

  

the success of our plm strategy will depend in large part on the ability of our windchillbased solutions to meet customer expectations especially with respect to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

the software is still relatively new if our customers cannot successfully deploy our solutions or if our solutions are not well accepted within our customers’ organizations by their users after deployment our operating results may be affected 

  

our plm solutions strategy is developing 

  

we are pursuing a strategy to provide a series of easily deployable plm solutions that address specific business challenges that arise at points along the product lifecycle timeline our windchill link solutions these windchill link solutions utilize our internetbased windchill architecture as well as components of our design solutions by offering preconfigured fully integrated applications that can be implemented quickly our strategy is designed both to solve customers’ problems relating to costly largescale implementation projects and to provide customers with the ability to deploy a product development system that meets their evolving requirements if we are unable to provide these solutions or are unable to meet customer expectations our overall revenue may be adversely affected 

  

our windchill link solutions may crowd out service revenue and our initiatives to utilize select resellers to distribute these solutions may put pressure on license margins 

  

our introduction of our windchill link solutions which have been developed to permit quick installation and provide customers more autonomy over solving their problems may have an adverse effect on our service revenue additionally we also have begun to offer a limited number of qualified resellers the ability to offer our windchill link solutions we believe that entering into these relationships will best serve to expand the coverage of our plm software solutions generate sufficient additional license revenue to compensate for reduced margins and provide the necessary regional coverage for their implementation and support if these assumptions prove to be inaccurate or if projected additional license revenue andor broader market coverage does not materialize our revenues may be adversely affected 

  

plm software solutions must meet our customers’ expectations for integration with existing systems to generate references for new accounts 

  

our plm software must integrate with our customers’ and their partners’ existing computer systems and software programs in certain cases we utilize thirdparty technologies to facilitate these integrations as many of our customers will be facing these 

  

integration issues for the first time particularly in the context of collaborating with customers supply chain partners and other members of the extended enterprise our customers could become dissatisfied with our products or services if systems integration proves to be difficult costly or time consuming and thus our operating results may be adversely affected moreover due to the emerging nature of the industry and technology the sales process relies in large part on customer references accordingly if our customers become dissatisfied future business and revenues may be adversely affected 

  

competition may increase which may reduce our profits and limit or reduce our market share 

  

the market for our plm software solutions is new highly fragmented rapidly changing and increasingly competitive we expect competition to intensify which could result in price reductions for our products and services reduced gross margins and loss of market share our primary competition comes from 

  

   

   

to compete effectively in this evolving industry we must successfully develop solutions that are technologically superior to those of our competitors effectively demonstrate the value proposition offered by our solutions including return on investment and value creation and overcome the perception based on our historical roots that we are solely a mechanical computer aided design mcad company 

  

in addition our services organization may face increasing competition for followon consulting implementation and education services from other thirdparty consultants and service providers including those of larger better known consulting firms that exert considerable influence within portions of our customer base to overcome the influence of larger enterprise software and consulting firms within our customer base we must successfully demonstrate the superiority of our offerings as well as a high level of customer satisfaction 

  

if the internet does not continue to develop or reliably support the demands placed on it by electronic commerce we may experience a loss of sales 

  

our success depends upon continued growth in the use of the internet as a medium of collaboration and commerce the use of the internet for collaboration and commerce is still relatively new as a result a sufficiently broad base of companies and their supply chain may not adopt or continue to use the internet as a medium of exchanging product information our plm strategy would be seriously harmed if 

  

   

   

our plm strategy will also be seriously harmed if the internet infrastructure is not able to support the demands placed on it by increased usage or the limited capacity of networks to transmit large amounts of data or if delays in the development or adoption of new equipment standards or protocols required to handle increased levels of internet activity or increased governmental regulation cause the internet to lose its viability as a means of communication between manufacturers and their customers and supply chain partners 

  

iv other considerations 

  

we will be required to obtain the attestation of our independent auditors relating to our internal controls over financial reporting 

  

section 404 of the sarbanes oxley act of 2002 requires that we receive the attestation of our independent auditors of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended  the “exchange act”  we must include in our fiscal 2005 annual report on form 10k 

  

including our financial statements our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting with our independent auditor’s attestation we have embarked on a program to review document and test our internal controls over financial reporting for presentation to and review by our independent auditors while we believe our internal controls over financial reporting are adequate and have been well documented there can be no assurances that we will receive the required attestation or that unforeseen circumstances will result in one or more of our controls becoming ineffective if we are not able to implement the requirements of section 404 in a timely manner our future financial performance and the market price of our stock may be adversely affected and we would potentially be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities including the securities and exchange commission or the nasdaq national market 

  

our stock price has been highly volatile this may make it harder to resell your shares at the time and at a price that is favorable to you 

  

market prices for securities of software companies have generally been volatile in particular the market price of these stocks has been and may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies the trading prices and valuations of these stocks and of ours may not be predictable negative changes in the public’s perception of the prospects of software companies or of ptc or the plm market generally could depress our stock price regardless of our results 

  

also traditionally a large percentage of our common stock has been held by institutional investors purchases and sales of our common stock by certain of these institutional investors could have a significant impact on the market price of the stock for more information please see our proxy statement with respect to our most recent annual meeting of stockholders and schedules 13d and 13g filed with the sec with respect to our common stock 

  

shortterm liquidity 

  

although we were profitable in the last three quarters of 2004 after several quarters of operating losses our liquidity position may be adversely affected if we are unable to sustain operating profitability or in the event we undertake larger corporate development initiatives which may lead to a diminished ability to implement strategic initiatives andor make investments in our operational infrastructure 

  

we are currently defending a lawsuit seeking substantial damages in which we could be liable 

  

on may 30 2003 a lawsuit was filed against us in the us district court for the district of massachusetts by rand a technology corporation and rand technologies limited collectively “rand” rand historically had been our largest distributor the complaint alleges various breaches of a revised distribution agreement entered into in december 2002 as well as other agreements between rand and us and also asserts certain noncontract claims the complaint as amended seeks equitable relief and substantial damages on november 24 2003 we filed our substantive response to rand’s complaint and asserted counterclaims against rand including among other things that rand’s action in filing the lawsuit constituted a breach of the december 2002 agreement which established certain dispute resolution procedures and which we believe discharged any and all claims arising prior to that date we believe rand’s claims are without merit and will continue to contest them vigorously we also intend diligently to prosecute our counterclaims we cannot predict the ultimate resolution of this action at this time and there can be no assurance that this action will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

we face exposure to financial market risks including adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 

  

foreign currency exchange risk 

  

our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to western european countries that use the euro as a common currency and to japan we enter into various hedging transactions to manage this risk we do not enter into or hold foreign currency derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

  

our international revenues generally are transacted through our nonus subsidiaries and typically are denominated in their local currency in addition our international expenses that are incurred by our international subsidiaries typically are denominated in their local currency approximately 65 63 and 58 of our total revenue was from sales to customers outside of north america in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively approximately 45 43 and 42 of our total expenses were incurred by our subsidiaries domiciled outside of north america in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively 

  

our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations arises in part from intercompany transactions with most intercompany transactions occurring between a us dollar functional currency entity and a foreign currency denominated entity intercompany transactions typically are denominated in the local currency of the international subsidiary in order to centralize foreign currency risk also both ptc the parent company and our international subsidiaries may transact business with our customers and vendors in a currency other than their functional currency “transaction risk” in addition we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results and balances of our international subsidiaries are translated into us dollars “translation risk” if sales to customers outside of the united states continue to comprise a growing percentage of total revenues our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates could increase 

  

our foreign currency risk management strategy is principally designed to mitigate the future potential financial impact of changes in the value of transactions and balances denominated in foreign currency resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates our foreign currency hedging program utilizes forward contracts to manage the foreign currency exposures that exist as part of our ongoing business operations the contracts primarily are denominated in european currencies and japanese yen and have maturities of less than three months 

  

generally we do not designate foreign currency forward contracts as hedges for accounting purposes and changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized immediately in earnings because we enter into forward contracts only as an economic hedge any gain or loss on the underlying foreigndenominated balance would be offset by the loss or gain on the forward contract gains and losses on forward contracts and foreign denominated receivables and payables are included in other income expense net as of september 30 2004 and 2003 we had outstanding forward contracts with notional amounts equivalent to approximately 833 million 589 million in euros 121 million in british pounds 64 million in japanese yen and 59 million in other currencies and 757 million 568 million in euros 81 million in british pounds 41 million in japanese yen and 67 million in other currencies respectively 

  

we periodically use foreign currency option contracts to hedge specific forecasted net cash flow transactions that are derived from anticipated international revenue foreign currency option contracts are designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes and changes in the fair value of the option contract are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings when the underlying forecasted transaction impacts earnings as of september 30 2004 and 2003 there were no foreign currency option contracts outstanding 

  

cash and cash equivalents 

  

as of september 30 2004 cash equivalents are invested in highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased we invest our cash with highly rated financial institutions in north america europe and asiapacific and in diversified domestic and international money market mutual funds at september 30 2004 we had 1289 million 924 million 642 million and 94 million of cash and cash equivalents in the united states europe japan and other international countries principally in asiapacific respectively given the short maturities and investment grade quality of the portfolio holdings at september 30 2004 a hypothetical 10 change in interest rates would not materially affect the fair value of our cash and cash equivalents 

  

our invested cash is subject to interest rate and for international operations foreign currency risk in a declining interest rate environment we would experience a decrease in interest income the opposite holds true in a rising interest rate environment over the past several years the us federal reserve board european central bank and bank of england have significantly decreased certain benchmark interest rates which has led to a general decline in market interest rates this decline in market interest rates has resulted in lower interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents in the second half of 2004 the us federal reserve board increased benchmark interest rates slightly interest income will continue to fluctuate based on changes in market interest rates and levels of cash available for investment during 2004 and 2003 our consolidated cash balances were impacted favorably by strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar particularly with respect to the euro and the japanese yen

nonstockholder approved plan 

  

ptc maintains the 1997 nonstatutory stock option the “plan” the purpose of the plan is to attract and retain key employees and consultants of the company and our majorityowned subsidiaries to provide an incentive for them to achieve longrange performance goals and to enable them to participate in our longterm growth our employees and consultants and those of any of our majorityowned subsidiaries capable of contributing significantly to the successful performance of the company are eligible for option awards under the plan our officers and directors are not eligible to participate in the plan options granted under the plan may only be stock options that are not intended to be “incentive stock options” within the meaning of section 422 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended 

  

the plan is administered by the committee subject to the provisions of the plan the committee has the authority to select the employees and consultants to whom options are granted and determine the terms of each option including the amount exercise price vesting schedule generally in four equal annual installments on each of the first four anniversaries of the date of grant and term which may not exceed ten years the per share exercise price of an option must be at least 100 of the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant 

  

options generally are exercisable only during an optionee’s term of employment or engagement as a consultant and for a period of between ten and ninety days after that term ends in the case of termination as a result of death or permanent disability options generally are exercisable thereafter for twelve months in the case of termination as a result of retirement options generally are exercisable thereafter for three months during the lifetime of the optionee his or her option is exercisable only by him or her and is not transferable except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution 

  

the committee may act to preserve an optionee’s rights under an option in the event of a change in control of ptc by i accelerating any time period relating to the exercise of the option ii providing for compensating payments to the optionee iii 

  

adjusting the terms of the option to reflect the change in control iv causing the option to be assumed by another entity or v making any other provision that the committee may consider equitable to optionees and in the best interests of ptc unless otherwise determined by the board stock options held by senior vice president and vice president level employees become exercisable in full if within one year following a change in control of ptc such employee’s employment is terminated without cause by the employee due to a change in status or due to his or her death or partial or total disability 

  

the board of directors may amend suspend or terminate the plan or any portion thereof at any time the committee may amend modify or terminate any outstanding award with the respective optionee’s consent unless the amendment would not materially and adversely affect the optionee in which case consent is not required however the committee may not without stockholder approval amend any outstanding option to reduce the exercise price at any time during the term of such option

windchill enterprise 

  

this product consists of a suite of commercial “offtheshelf” application modules for an engineering environment consisting principally of the following a vault for data management to store and retrieve product files workflow applications for sequencing the flow of product information and change management processes visualization software for enabling the customer to see a threedimensional view of product data and when desired data adaptors for connecting to standard computer aided design cad software or standard enterprise resource planning erp systems via standard application interfaces the application modules include standard features and functions with capabilities in 

  

product management offers enterprise scalable pdm functionality to promote concurrent engineering and to create a single source of product information available to all functional organizations facilitating product change management throughout the entire product lifecycle 

  

collaboration provides an environment where businesses can share product and process information throughout the extended enterprise regardless of where that information resides or in what format it is 

  

product planning enables businesses to meet the increasing demand for customtailored products while minimizing the overall number of product variations this is accomplished by providing the means to define engineeredtoorder products supply customerspecific portals and easily identify existing variations for future reuse 

  

sourcing gives manufacturers the ability to reduce global procurement and product development costs by standardizing and consolidating part and supplier information the application module enables companies to identify reusable parts commercially available solutions and preferred sources 

  

manufacturing integrates a company’s product development and design with its manufacturing processes by creating and maintaining detailed process plans and executing production analysis and process simulation this application module allows companies to increase information capture and reuse optimize manufacturing processes and share this knowledge across the enterprise 

  

production integrates windchill with marketleading erp systems allowing the exchange of productrelated information including part masters bills of material and engineering change information between windchill and those systems 

  

windchill link solutions 

  

these solutions consist of preconfigured integrated products that utilize the webbased windchill architecture as well as components of our design solutions and our windchill enterprise application modules these products can be implemented in as little as several weeks in accordance with a predefined implementation methodology and with little configuration these products are

product development 

  

for our products and services to be competitive we must provide our customers with new and innovative software and service solutions as a result we continue to spend on research and development and we regularly are looking for opportunities to acquire new technologies suited to our customers’ needs we also must efficiently manage our development resources to ensure that the appropriate balance based on both product development plans and customer demand is reached between product lines 

  

our ability to rapidly develop new design products is facilitated by the modular structure of our software code this structure enables functional capabilities of existing products to be utilized by new software applications or modules thereby reducing the amount of new code required to develop additional products the major benefit of this approach is rapid development of new functionality 

  

our windchill technology has expanded the breadth of our offerings allowing for a comprehensive suite of plm solutions much of this technology is internetcentric javabased objectoriented software our products depend on these evolving technologies as well as certain licensed thirdparty technologies 

  

we work closely with our customers to define improvements and enhancements to be integrated into our products using this approach customers become involved in the software design process to validate feasibility and to influence functionality early in the product life cycle in addition we maintain software and hardware partner programs designed to provide partners both with access to our products and with the mechanisms and environment to facilitate the integration of complementary products with our product lines through our open software toolkits program members can build tightly integrated solutions that satisfy the various requirements of our customers 

  

our fiscal year research and development expenses were 1361 million in 2002 1489 million in 2001 and 1438 million in 2000 

sales and marketing 

  

we derive most of our revenue from products distributed directly by our sales force to our enduser customers in addition we offer products through thirdparty distributors and we also offer certain of our design solutions over the internet no single customer accounted for more than 10 of our revenue in any of the last three fiscal years 

  

within our direct sales force there are both strategic accounts and general business accounts units the strategic accounts unit is further segmented into vertical groupings based on industry characteristics in addition we continue to broaden our indirect distribution channel through alliances with thirdparty systems integrators resellers and other strategic partners the systems integrators work in tandem with our direct sales force to locate and target potential plm opportunities we also have signed agreements with approximately 180 resellers giving them the rights to distribute our design solutions products and to provide related services throughout north america europe and parts of asiapacific

forwardlooking statements 

  

statements in this annual report on form 10k about our anticipated financial results and longterm growth as well as about the development of our products and markets are forward looking statements that are based on our current plans and assumptions important information about the bases for these plans and assumptions and certain factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements is contained below and in “important factors that may affect future results” beginning on page 21 unless otherwise indicated all references to a year reflect our fiscal year that ends on september 30 

  

introduction 

  

as described in note b to our accompanying consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k and on page f27 we have restated our financial statements for the fiscal years ended september 30 2001 2000 and 1999 in connection with the implementation of a new accounting system in late 2002 we subsequently determined that we had miscalculated the allocation of deferred maintenance revenues from 1999 through 2002 resulting in revenues not being recognized in the proper periods we identified an aggregate of 334 million of maintenance revenue recognized during the periods 1999 through 2002 that should have been deferred at september 30 2002 to be recognized in fiscal 2003 and later periods as a result service 

revenue has been reduced by 120 million 28 million 145 million and 41 million for fiscal years 2002 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively the financial information for all periods included in the following discussion gives effect to the restatement 

  

a summary of the effects of the restatement on our consolidated financial statements for 2001 and 2000 is as follows 

  

 

  

 

  

we delayed filing of this annual report on form 10k because of the need to determine the allocation of deferred maintenance revenue in 2002 and prior periods we required additional time to quantify and assess the effect and to determine the appropriate resolution in the company’s financial statements due to this delay we received a nasdaq staff determination letter on january 15 2003 advising that we were not in compliance with the filing requirements for continued listing set forth in nasdaq marketplace rule 4310 c14 accordingly the nasdaq staff determination letter stated that our common stock was subject to delisting from the nasdaq stock market in accordance with nasdaq procedure we requested a nasdaq listing qualifications panel hearing to review the staff determination the hearing request stayed the delisting of our securities pending the panel’s decision a hearing date has been set for february 14 2003 and delisting can be prevented by the panel although by this filing we are now current with our sec filings there can be no assurance that the panel will grant ptc’s request for continued listing 

  

business overview 

  

historically our core business focus has been to provide design solutions to customers through our flagship proengineer design software and we continue to provide our customers with industry leading product development manufacturing and engineering design solutions based on this software license and services revenue associated with our design solutions continues to comprise a majority of our revenue 

  

while the discrete market for computeraided design solutions has declined we believe that there is opportunity for growth in an adjacent collaboration and control solutions market as these two markets converge into the 

broader plm opportunity we see an opportunity to address several key challenges that manufacturing companies face in their product development processes more frequent change heterogeneity of systems and increased communication inside and outside the manufacturing enterprise to support growing outsourcing and increasingly transparent supply chains accordingly we have channeled significant resources into our windchillbased collaboration and control solutions technology 

  

in 1998 we introduced our webbased windchill information management and collaboration software that works across the complete product lifecycle from product planning and design through manufacturing distribution and retirement during 2001 and 2002 we introduced a series of point solutions that utilize the webbased windchill architecture each designed to address businesscritical manufacturing functions these solutions include windchill projectlink windchill pdmlink windchill partslink and windchill dynamicdesignlink 

  

in addition we continue to improve the usability of our design solutions and to more tightly integrate them with our collaboration and control solutions we have introduced a preproduction evaluation release of proengineer wildfire the next release of our proengineer design solution proengineer wildfire which we expect to begin commercial shipments of during the first calendar quarter of 2003 is designed to offer design engineers enhanced ease of use and integration with our windchill suite of solutions 

  

these design solution and collaboration and control solution products are part of our overall strategy to provide a complete portfolio of plm solutions that address specific business challenges that occur at various points in the product lifecycle going forward we plan to evaluate periodically the requirements of our customers and general market need for additional solutions 

  

all of our software solutions continue to be distributed primarily through our direct sales force in tandem with our direct sales force we utilize both an inside sales group focused predominately on telesales and existing accounts and an indirect distribution channel our indirect distribution channel has been broadened over the last two years through formal and informal alliances with thirdparty systems integrators resellers and other strategic partners the systems integrator partners work with our direct sales force to locate and target potential plm opportunities we have also increased the number of resellers for our design solutions to provide greater geographic and smaller account coverage while we do not expect these reseller relationships to have any significant immediate impact we plan to continue to work on strengthening these relationships to achieve greater market penetration over time

revenue 

  

total revenue 

  

our revenue consists of software license revenue and service revenue service revenue includes maintenance new releases and technical support consulting and education revenues we derived 58 56 and 59 of our total revenue from sales to customers outside of north america in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively overall our total revenue decreased 21 in 2002 compared to 2001 after an increase of 2 in 2001 compared to 2000 total revenue in 2002 reflects a decrease in both our total collaboration and control windchillbased solutions revenue and our total design solutions revenue total revenue was adversely affected by continued weakness in technology spending in the global manufacturing economy and declines in our market share for our design solutions products 

  

license revenue accounted for 33 of total revenue in 2002 and 41 of total revenue in both 2001 and 2000 total license revenue decreased 36 in 2002 compared to 2001 and increased 1 in 2001 compared to 2000 service revenue accounted for 67 of total revenue in 2002 and 59 of total revenue in both 2001 and 2000 service revenue which has a lower gross profit margin than license revenue decreased 10 in 2002 compared to 2001 and increased 3 in 2001 compared to 2000 service revenue has been and may continue to be adversely affected by lower license sales in current and prior periods 

  

collaboration and control windchillbased solutions revenue 

  

total revenue from our windchillbased collaboration and control solutions software and related services was 24 23 and 19 of our total revenue in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively this revenue declined 19 in 

2002 compared to 2001 after growing 23 in 2001 compared to 2000 we attribute this decrease to what we perceive as a temporary economyrelated market decline as we have maintained our market share during 2002 to meet what we believe is an opportunity for growth in the broader plm solutions market we have invested over the past two years significant resources in our windchill technology while we continue to derive our overall license and service revenue primarily from our design solutions our collaboration and control solutions revenue continues to comprise an increasing percentage of total revenue 

  

license revenue for our collaboration and control software decreased 36 to 619 million in 2002 compared to 962 million in 2001 and increased 3 in 2001 compared to 931 million in 2000 service revenue related to collaboration and control software decreased 5 in 2002 to 1151 million from 1211 million in 2001 compared to an increase of 45 in 2001 from 834 million in 2000 windchillbased license and service revenue was adversely affected by a decline in large customer commitments beginning in the second half of 2001 and continuing through 2002 we attribute the decrease in what had been a growing product line to the reluctance of our customers to consummate large enterprise software purchases in the current unstable economic climate planned growth in our partner program described below resulting in lower service revenues and to a lesser extent customer uncertainty experienced during 2002 related to our rapid introduction of various products over the past year 

  

since introducing our windchill technology we have focused on offering enterprisewide solutions which are characterized by longer and less predictable sales cycles and more complex service engagements while comprising a small portion of our overall revenues these enterprise offerings still account for much of our collaboration and control related revenue to complement our enterprise offerings we have introduced windchillbased point solutions targeted at specific businesscritical plm processes our windchill link solutions these windchill link solutions can be implemented both easily and quickly which may limit service revenue opportunities but should help generate additional license revenue once they begin to gain acceptance in the marketplace we believe these solutions address a growing customer demand for improved and faster return on investment and plan to evaluate periodically the requirements of our customers and general market need for additional solutions 

  

we also have entered into business relationships with leading systems integrators and other strategic partners to expand the footprint of our distribution and services efforts while these initiatives have contributed to recent declines in service revenues and may limit some opportunities for additional service revenue growth within enterpriselevel implementations we believe that entering into these relationships will best serve to expand the coverage of our collaboration and control software solutions generate additional license and maintenance revenue and provide necessary expertise for implementation and support of our products 

  

design solutions revenue 

  

total revenue from our design solutions and related services was 76 77 and 81 of our total revenue in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively we have been experiencing declines in our design solutions revenue and our market share total revenue from our design solutions decreased 22 to 5649 million in 2002 compared to 7203 million in 2001 and decreased 3 in 2001 compared to 7423 million in 2000 total license revenue for our design solutions decreased 37 to 1810 million in 2002 compared to 2857 million in 2001 after remaining flat in 2001 compared to 2855 million in 2000 service revenue for our design solutions decreased 12 to 3839 million in 2002 compared to 4345 million in 2001 and decreased 5 in 2001 compared to 4569 million in 2000 our design solutions software unit sales decreased by 29 in 2002 compared to 2001 and decreased 1 in 2001 compared to 2000 the average selling price of our design solutions software decreased by 11 in 2002 compared to 2001 after a slight increase of 1 in 2001 compared to 2000 reasons for declines in our design solutions revenue include the weakness in technology spending in the global manufacturing economy which has led to a decline in large dollar license transactions with existing customers increased competition and price pressure from products offering more limited functionality at lower cost the difficulty associated with displacing incumbent product design systems in the discrete market for computeraided 

design solutions the redeployment of our direct sales and marketing resources to our collaboration and control solutions and the transition period associated with our continuing investment and increased use of our indirect distribution channel 

  

to address the decline in our design solutions revenue and loss of market share we are in the process of introducing design solutions packages that have price points functionality and easeofuse features that appeal to the entire spectrum of design solution users proengineer wildfire currently in preproduction supports web interfaces and windchillbased interfaces that will provide customers with the opportunity to more readily integrate traditional design solutions with collaboration and control solutions the product’s new user interface makes it more competitive with lowerend modeling tools on the market known for easeofuse while maintaining the powerful functionality of proengineer the new web interface is unique to proengineer and creates a differentiated design solution for manufacturing companies looking for a complete product development system production version shipments are expected to begin in the first calendar quarter of 2003 

  

to provide the resources necessary for the effective distribution of our design solutions we have been building and diversifying our reseller channel to become less dependent on a small number of distributors we believe that utilizing diverse and geographically dispersed distributors that focus on smaller businesses provides an efficient and cost effective means to reach these customers while allowing our direct sales force to focus on higher impact sales opportunities in 2002 2001 and 2000 we licensed approximately 75 87 and 92 respectively of our design solutions products directly to enduser customers the balance was licensed through thirdparty distributors we expect the percentage of our design solutions that we license through thirdparty distributors and agents will continue to increase and that this revenue will become more diversified across our many distributors 

  

  

  

outlook 

  

looking forward our overall performance will depend on improved economic conditions and the strengthening of technology spending in the global manufacturing sector our ability to elevate plm expenditures over other technology spending as a budgetary priority among our customers our ability to successfully execute our product strategy to provide an integrated easy to use and rapidly deployable suite of plm software solutions that enable creation collaboration and control across the extended design chain with a proven return on investment and our 

ability to differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors we have over the course of 2001 and 2002 released a suite of windchill link point solutions targeted for the market that we see developing for overall plm solutions and have introduced the preproduction version of proengineer wildfire the next release of our proengineer design solution proengineer wildfire is designed to offer design engineers enhanced ease of use and the ability to integrate design tools with our windchill link solutions this suite of plm solutions provides the foundation for our future growth as they expand upon traditional highend design solutions for which the market has declined we must accordingly focus on refining and marketing these solutions so that our customers are able to clearly recognize and understand their advantages 

  

as a key component to informing our customers about plm we recently announced “the way to product first a roadmap for creating and capturing value” the way to product first is a detailed product development strategy roadmap for manufacturing companies trying to improve their use of the product development process to create sustainable value it provides a framework for companies looking to improve their business with a centralized focus on creating better products through specific product development strategies initiatives and competencies we believe the roadmap clearly demonstrates the link between the product development process and achieving corporate goals and objectives as such the roadmap will be an important tool for demonstrating the value of our plm solutions 

  

our success also will depend on other factors including our ability to optimize our sales coverage and productivity through among other means effective utilization and management of our thirdparty systems integrator partners resellers and other strategic partners as well as our own sales teams our ability to further improve customer satisfaction and to build customer references and our success at penetrating strategic emerging markets we believe we have made progress on these initiatives however spending in our sector of the economy is weak and in our view is likely to continue at disappointing levels for the next several quarters we believe that the weakness in the economy continues to impact our revenue by causing our customers to reduce or defer their expenditures for software and services 

  

additional factors affecting our revenues and operating results are identified under “ important factors that may affect future results ” below 

  

costs and expenses 

  

all cost and expense categories in 2002 2001 and 2000 were impacted by restructuring charges taken in those periods our operating expenses are based on anticipated future revenue and are largely fixed for the short term due to lower than expected revenues we initiated cost cutting measures and reduced our headcount to 3803 and 4533 at the end of 2002 and 2001 respectively down from 4725 at september 30 2000 as a result of these headcount reductions and excess facility costs we recorded restructuring charges of 312 million in 2002 426 million in 2001 and 215 million in 2000 see “ restructuring charges ” below and note c of “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

  

as a result of restructuring initiatives costs and expenses excluding amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets and restructuring charges decreased 13 in 2002 to 7535 million compared to 8628 million in 2001 and decreased 2 in 2001 compared to 8817 million in 2000 

  

cost of license revenue 

  

our cost of license revenue consists of costs associated with reproducing and distributing software and documentation and the payment of royalties cost of license revenue was 167 million 157 million and 167 million for 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively cost of license revenue as a percentage of license revenue was 7 for 2002 and 4 for both 2001 and 2000 

  

cost of service revenue 

  

  

our cost of service revenue includes costs associated with training customer support and consulting personnel such as salaries and related costs and the release of maintenance updates cost of service revenue as a percentage of service revenue was 40 in 2002 45 in 2001 and 43 in 2000 service revenue margins improved primarily as a result of a higher mix of maintenance revenue in 2002 as well as a decrease in servicerelated employee headcount of 20 from september 30 2001 to september 30 2002 in 2001 we initiated and implemented a strategy to develop systems integrator alliances and programs that has allowed us to reduce the staffing necessary to support our product offerings the startup costs of implementing these initiatives were incurred in 2001 and the ongoing cost of maintaining this program has been lower in 2002 compared to 2001 

  

sales and marketing 

  

our sales and marketing expenses primarily include salaries and benefits sales commissions advertising and marketing programs travel and facility costs sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenue were 45 41 and 45 for 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively total sales and marketing employee headcount decreased 17 at the end of 2002 and 3 at the end of 2001 compared to the prior year at the end of 2002 2001 and 2000 sales and marketing headcount was 1358 employees 1646 employees and 1702 employees respectively compared to the prior year total sales and marketing expenses decreased 13 in 2002 and 9 in 2001 these decreases are primarily due to reduced headcount the centralization of our presales delivery group through the establishment of “innovationcenters” and lower commissions resulting from lower license revenue these cost reductions were partially offset by an increase in marketing programs in 2002 

  

research and development 

  

our research and development expenses consist principally of salaries and benefits expenses associated with product translations costs of computer equipment used in software development and facility expenses compared to the prior year research and development expenses decreased 9 in 2002 and increased 4 in 2001 the decrease in research and development expenses in 2002 is primarily due to an 11 decrease in headcount at the end of 2002 compared to 2001 the increase in 2001 is primarily attributable to investments in windchillbased solutions research and development 

  

general and administrative 

  

our general and administrative expenses include the costs of our corporate finance information technology human resources and administrative functions compared to the prior year these costs decreased 2 in 2002 and 3 in 2001 the decrease in 2002 reflects a 13 decrease in headcount partially offset by an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts expense and investments in information technology systems and financial infrastructure the decrease in 2001 is due primarily to a lower allowance for doubtful accounts expense partially offset by an increase in headcount and investments in information technology systems and business process improvements the allowance for doubtful accounts expense in 2002 2001 and 2000 was 43 million 29 million and 76 million respectively 

  

amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets 

  

these costs represent the amortization of intangible assets acquired including developed technology goodwill customer lists assembled work force and trade names amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets as a percentage of total revenue was 5 in 2002 and 4 in both 2001 and 2000 amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets is principally from our 1999 acquisitions of division group plc and auxilium inc as a result of adopting sfas no 142 beginning in the first quarter of 2003 quarterly amortization of goodwill and intangible assets related to goodwill will be reduced by approximately 7 million 

  

restructuring charges 

  

in 2002 2001 and 2000 we recorded restructuring charges of 312 million 426 million and 215 million primarily associated with reductions in workforce to reduce our cost structure and improve profitability in 2002 2001 and 2000 we made cash payments of 425 million 244 million and 303 million for restructuring charges respectively amounts not yet paid at september 30 2002 related to restructuring charges were 380 million primarily related to excess facility obligations and severance termination benefits of which we expect to pay approximately 15 million within the next twelve months 

  

the restructuring charges in 2002 include 173 million for severance and termination benefits of approximately 310 employees who were notified or identified for termination during the year and 139 million for excess facilities the excess facilities charges are primarily comprised of an increase to reserves on existing excess facilities needed as a result of current real estate market conditions and related actions taken by several sublease tenants during our fourth quarter of 2002 

  

the restructuring charges in 2001 include 257 million for severance and termination benefits of approximately 720 employees who were notified or identified for termination during the year 99 million for facility consolidations and 70 million primarily for a writedown of assets related to a focus shift in certain products the noncash portion of this restructuring charge was 40 million 

  

the restructuring charges in 2000 include 119 million for severance and termination benefits of approximately 280 employees who were notified or identified for termination during the year and 96 million for facility consolidations 

  

writedown of investments 

  

we periodically review equity investments for impairment based on market conditions the industry sectors in which the investment entity operates the viability and prospects of each entity as well as the continued strategic importance of the investment to us a writedown of the related investment is recorded when an impairment is considered other than temporary in 2002 and 2001 we recorded writedowns on several equity investments of 10 million and 104 million respectively to reflect other than temporary declines in valuation at september 30 2002 and 2001 equity investments included in other longterm assets were 10 million and 20 million respectively 

  

gain on sale of a business 

  

in the fourth quarter of 2002 we completed the sale of our icem surfacing business for 102 million in cash resulting in a pretax gain of 87 million 

  

interest income 

  

interest income relates to earnings on the investment of our excess cash balances in various financial instruments the 59 and 24 decrease in interest income in 2002 and 2001 respectively resulted primarily from lower annual yields and lower average cash balances 

  

other income expense net 

  

a large portion of our revenue and expenses is transacted in foreign currencies to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates we routinely engage in hedging transactions involving the use of foreign currency forward contracts and from timetotime foreign currency option contracts primarily in the euro and in asian currencies our other income expense net includes the costs of the hedging contracts the gain or loss from the translation of results for subsidiaries for which the us dollar is the functional currency and other 

charges primarily related to financing costs see item 7a below and note a of “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

  

income taxes 

  

our effective tax rate was 26 on a pretax loss of 743 million in 2002 compared to an effective tax rate benefit of 26 in 2001 and 26 in 2000 the difference between the statutory federal income tax rate benefit of 35 and the effective tax rate provision of 26 recorded in 2002 is due primarily to the increase in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets discussed below and nondeductible acquisitionrelated amortization costs offset by a benefit due to the sale of the icem business as a result of operating losses incurred in recent years and uncertainty as to the extent and timing of profitability in future periods we increased our valuation allowance for our remaining net deferred tax assets by approximately 480 million through the provision for income taxes in 2002 due to the uncertainty regarding their realizability see critical accounting policies and note e of “notes to consolidated financial statements” the reduced effective tax rate benefit in 2001 compared to the statutory federal income tax rate benefit of 35 resulted primarily from the nondeductibility of certain acquisitionrelated amortization costs net operating losses of foreign entities that could not be benefited and a valuation allowance that was established for foreign tax credit carryforwards partially offset by a decrease of deferred tax liabilities related to unrepatriated foreign earnings the reduced effective tax rate benefit in 2000 resulted primarily from the nondeductability of certain acquisitionrelated amortization costs and net operating losses of foreign entities which could not be benefited 

  

critical accounting policies 

  

the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses management has made its best estimates and judgments giving due consideration to materiality and these estimates judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process actual results could differ from those estimates note a to the consolidated financial statements included herein describes our significant accounting policies 

  

certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application these include 

  

revenue recognition 

  

we derive revenues from two primary sources 1 software license revenues and 2 services revenues which include maintenance consulting and education revenues while the basis for software revenue recognition is substantially governed by the provisions of statement of position no 972 “software revenue recognition” “sop 972” and statement of position no 989 “modification of sop 972 software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions” “sop 989” both issued by the american institute of certified public accountants and sec staff accounting bulletin 101 “revenue recognition in financial statements” we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of software license and services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period 

  

for software license arrangements that do not require significant modification or customization of the underlying software we recognize revenue when 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 2 delivery has occurred fob shipping point or electronic distribution 3 the fee is deemed fixed or determinable and 4 collection is probable substantially all of our license revenues are recognized in this manner 

  

our software is distributed primarily through our direct sales force however our indirect distribution channel continues to expand through alliances with resellers revenue arrangements with resellers are recognized on a sellthrough basis that is when we receive persuasive evidence that the reseller has sold the products to an end user customer we do not offer contractual rights of return stock balancing or price protection 

  

we assess whether fees are fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties at the time of sale and recognize revenue if all other revenue recognition criteria are met if the fee is not fixed or determinable revenue is recognized as payments become due from the customer 

  

our license arrangements generally do not include acceptance provisions however if an arrangement includes an acceptance provision acceptance occurs upon the earlier of receipt of a written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period we record revenue only after customer acceptance if any has occurred 

  

our software arrangements may include consulting services sold separately under consulting engagement contracts that generally include implementation these services may be provided completely or partially by independent thirdparties experienced in providing such consulting and implementation in coordination with dedicated customer personnel revenues from these arrangements are generally accounted for separately from the license revenue because the arrangements qualify as “service transactions” as defined in sop 972 the more significant factors considered in determining whether the revenue should be accounted for separately include the nature of services ie consideration of whether the services are essential to the functionality of the licensed product degree of risk availability of services from other vendors timing of payments and impact of milestones or acceptance criteria on the realizability of the software license fee 

  

if an arrangement does not qualify for separate accounting of the license and service transactions then license revenue is recognized together with the consulting services based on contract accounting using either the percentageofcompletion or completedcontract method as described below contract accounting is also applied to any software arrangements 1 that include milestones or customer specific acceptance criteria which may affect collection of the license fees 2 where services include significant modification or customization of the software or 3 where the license payment is tied to the performance of consulting services 

  

we estimate the percentage of completion on contracts with fixed or “not to exceed” fees on a monthly basis utilizing hours incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated hours to complete the project if we do not have a sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion revenue is recognized upon completion of the contract when total cost estimates exceed revenues we accrue for the estimated losses immediately 

  

we account for software license revenues included in multiple element arrangements using the residual method prescribed in sop 989 under the residual method the fair value of the undelivered elements ie maintenance consulting and education services based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements ie software license if evidence of the fair value of one or more of the undelivered services does not exist revenues are deferred and recognized when delivery of those services occurs or fair value can be established we determine vsoe of fair value for services revenues based upon our current pricing for those services when sold separately and vsoe of fair value for maintenance services may additionally be measured by substantive renewal rates our current pricing practices are influenced primarily by product type purchase volume maintenance term and customer location we review services revenues sold separately and maintenance renewal rates on a periodic basis and update when appropriate our vsoe of fair value for such services revenues to ensure that it reflects our current pricing significant incremental discounts offered in multiple element arrangements that would be characterized as separate elements are infrequent and are allocated to software license revenues under the residual method 

  

maintenance services generally include rights to unspecified upgrades when and if available telephone support updates and bug fixes maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract on a straightline basis when all the revenue recognition requirements are met it is uncommon for us to offer a specified upgrade to an existing product however in such instances revenue is deferred until the future obligation is delivered 

  

consulting revenues are generally recognized as the services are performed on a time and materials basis consulting revenues for fixedpriced contracts are recognized using percentage of completion accounting described above if there is a significant uncertainty about the project completion or receipt of payment for the consulting services revenue is deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved reimbursements of outofpocket expenditures incurred in connection with providing consulting services are included in services revenue with the offsetting expense recorded in cost of services revenue 

  

education services include handson webbased and classroom training and selfevaluation education revenues are recognized as the related training services are provided 

  

valuation of longlived assets 

  

we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles longlived assets and related goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business significant negative industry or economic trends a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period or a reduction of our market capitalization relative to net book value if an impairment review is triggered we measure any impairment based on projected cash flows our net goodwill and other intangible assets totaled 543 million and 928 million as of september 30 2002 and 2001 respectively 

  

we adopted statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” effective october 1 2002 and as a result we will no longer amortize goodwill as a result of adopting sfas no 142 quarterly amortization of goodwill and intangible assets related to goodwill will be reduced by approximately 7 million in 2003 compared to 2002 in lieu of amortization we are required to perform an initial impairment review of our goodwill in 2003 and an annual impairment review thereafter we currently do not expect to record an impairment charge upon completion of the initial impairment review however if a charge was deemed necessary it would directly affect net income for the period in which the charge was taken there can be no assurance that at the time the review is completed an impairment charge will not be recorded in light of the factors described in the preceding paragraph 

  

accounting for income taxes 

  

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process involves estimating our actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items such as deferred revenue for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheet we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized we must establish a valuation allowance to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 

  

significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets net deferred tax liabilities at september 30 2002 were 06 million comprised of deferred tax assets of 1174 million a 

valuation allowance of 963 million and deferred tax liabilities of 217 million our deferred tax assets consist primarily of net operating loss carryforwards in 2002 we increased our deferred tax valuation allowance and recorded a corresponding 480 million charge to income tax expense the decision to record the valuation allowance required significant judgment had we not recorded this valuation allowance we would have reported materially different results if the realization of deferred tax assets in the future is considered more likely than not an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase net income in the period such determination was made 

  

allowance for accounts and other receivables 

  

management judgment is required in assessing the collectability of customer accounts and other receivables for which we generally do not require collateral we accordingly maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments management specifically analyzes individual accounts receivable historical bad debts customer concentrations customer creditworthiness current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 

  

our accounts receivable balance was 1575 million net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of 62 million as of september 30 2002 if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate additional allowances may be required resulting in future operating expenses that are not included in the allowance for doubtful accounts concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables is not significant except for a receivable from our largest distributor rand a technology corporation which accounted for 9 of total receivables as of september 30 2002 in the first quarter of 2003 we amended our distribution agreements with rand covering certain territories and rand’s distribution rights under these agreements will now expire on december 31 2003 rather than october 1 2005 we do not expect the revisions to the distribution agreements to have a material impact on our operating results 

  

restructuring charges 

  

we periodically record restructuring charges resulting from restructuring operations including consolidations andor relocations of operations changes in our strategic plan or managerial responses to declines in demand increasing costs or other environmental factors the determination of restructuring charges requires management’s judgment and may include costs related to employee benefits such as costs of severance and termination benefits and costs for future lease commitments on excess facilities net of estimated future sublease income in determining the amount of the facilities charge we are required to estimate such factors as future vacancy rates the time required to sublet properties and sublease rates these estimates will be reviewed and potentially revised on a quarterly basis based on known real estate market conditions and the credit worthiness of subtenants resulting in revisions to established facility reserves in june 2002 the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 146 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  in sfas no 146 an entity’s commitment to a plan does not by itself create a present obligation to other parties that meets the definition of a liability sfas no 146 also establishes that fair value is the objective for the initial measurement of the liability sfas no 146 will be effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december 31 2002 

  

accounting changes 

  

accounting policies guidelines and interpretations related to our critical accounting policies are generally subject to numerous sources of authoritative guidance and are often reexamined by accounting standards rule makers and regulators these rule makers andor regulators may promulgate interpretations guidance or regulations that may result in changes to our accounting policies which could result in a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

 

  

our operating activities the proceeds from our issuance of stock under stock plans and existing cash and investments provided sufficient resources to fund our employee base capital asset needs stock repurchases acquisitions and financing needs in all years presented 

  

as of september 30 2002 cash and investments totaled 2104 million down from 2491 million at september 30 2001 our investment portfolio is diversified among security types industries and individual issuers our investments are generally liquid and investment grade the portfolio is primarily invested in shortterm securities to minimize interest rate risk and to ensure cash is available to meet requirements as needed the decrease in cash and investments during 2002 consisted primarily of 226 million used for operations and 214 million used for investing activities partially offset by 36 million provided by financing activities 

  

cash used for operations was 226 million in 2002 compared to 511 million of cash provided by operations in 2001 the additional cash required for operations in 2002 was due primarily to higher net operating losses of 785 million in 2002 compared to 58 million in 2001 and cash disbursements to fund cost cutting measures consisting primarily of headcount reductions of 425 million in 2002 compared to 244 million in 2001 partially offset by favorable changes in operating assets and liabilities 

  

cash used to fund investing activities was 214 million in 2002 compared to 467 million in 2001 the decrease in cash used to fund investing activities in 2002 compared to 2001 is due primarily to lower capital expenditures in 2002 and 102 million of proceeds from the sale of a business in 2002 partially offset by lower net proceeds from sales and maturities of investments in 2002 2001 and 2000 we acquired 317 million 644 million and 398 million respectively of capital equipment and other intangible assets our expenditures for property and equipment consist primarily of computer equipment software office equipment and facility improvements the capital expenditures for 2001 include approximately 282 million for tenant improvements furniture and fixtures related to our facility consolidation in massachusetts we spent 79 million in 2000 to acquire businesses in december 1999 we sold land and certain improvements under construction for 308 million and entered into an operating lease covering approximately 381000 square feet of office space in needham massachusetts to consolidate our massachusetts facilities 

  

cash provided by financing activities was 36 million in 2002 compared to cash used for financing activities of 1075 million in 2001 the increase is due to lower stock repurchases in 2002 partially offset by lower proceeds from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans in 2002 2001 and 2000 we used cash to repurchase 50 million 1317 million and 900 million respectively of our common stock these expenditures were partially offset by proceeds of 86 million 242 million and 796 million in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively from the issuance of our common stock under our stock plans since 1998 through september 2002 we repurchased at a cost of 3667 million a total of 311 million shares of the 400 million shares authorized by the board of directors to be repurchased under our repurchase program in 2002 135 million shares of treasury stock were retired and restored to the status of authorized but unissued shares all shares of our common stock repurchased in the future if any shall automatically be restored to the status of authorized and unissued shares 

  

we lease office facilities and certain equipment under operating leases that expire at various dates through 2014 including an operating lease agreement related to our headquarters office in needham massachusetts entered 

into in 2000 which expires in december 2012 subject to certain renewal rights these leases qualify for operating lease accounting treatment and as such were not included on our balance sheet at september 30 2002 our future minimum lease payments net of sublease income for the next five years under noncancellable operating leases with remaining terms of one or more years are 409 million 322 million 273 million 215 million and 185 million for the years 2003 through 2007 respectively and 800 million thereafter for further information on our operating lease commitments refer to note g of “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

  

we believe that existing cash and shortterm investments together with cash generated from operations and the issuance of common stock under our stock plans will be sufficient to meet our working capital financing and capital expenditure requirements through at least 2003 in the first quarter of 2003 we received a us federal income tax refund of 482 million and we made a 106 million cash contribution to our us defined benefit pension plan during 2003 we expect to incur cash disbursements estimated at 12 million for restructuring charges incurred in prior periods capital expenditures for 2003 are currently anticipated to approximate capital expenditures incurred during fiscal 2002 but could be reduced if our growth is less than anticipated our cash position could be adversely affected should operating losses continue and we continue to invest in our collaboration and control business without realizing business growth 

  

new accounting pronouncements 

  

in accordance with recently issued accounting pronouncements we will be required to comply with certain changes in accounting rules and regulations see note a of “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

  

important factors that may affect future results 

  

the following are some of the factors that could affect our future results they should be considered in connection with evaluating forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report on form 10k and otherwise made by us or on our behalf because these factors could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in forwardlooking statements 

  

i operational considerations 

  

our operating results fluctuate within each quarter and from quarter to quarter making our future revenues and operating results difficult to predict 

  

while our sales cycle varies substantially from customer to customer we usually realize a high percentage of our revenue in the third month of each fiscal quarter and this revenue tends to be concentrated in the later part of that month our orders early in a quarter will not generally occur at a rate which if sustained throughout the quarter would be sufficient to assure that we will meet our revenue targets for any particular quarter moreover our transition from a oneproduct to a multiproduct company our increased utilization of indirect distribution channels through alliances with thirdparty systems integrators resellers and other strategic partners and our shift in business emphasis to a more solutionsoriented sales process have resulted in more unpredictable and often longer sales cycles for products and services accordingly our quarterly results may be difficult to predict prior to the end of the quarter any inability to obtain large orders or orders in large volumes or to make shipments or perform services in the period immediately preceding the end of any particular quarter may cause the results for that quarter to fall short of our revenue targets in addition our operating expenses are based on expected future revenue and are relatively fixed for the short term as a result a revenue shortfall in any quarter could cause our earnings for that quarter to fall below expectations as well any failure to meet our quarterly revenue or earnings targets could adversely impact the market price of our stock 

  

other factors that may cause quartertoquarter revenue and earnings fluctuations or that may affect our ability to make quarter end shipments include the following 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

in addition the levels of quarterly or annual software or service revenue in general or for particular geographic areas may not be comparable to those achieved in previous periods 

  

general economic and political conditions may impact our results 

  

our revenue growth and profitability depends on the overall demand for software and related services this demand can be adversely affected by unfavorable economic conditions as customers reduce or defer spending on information technology improvements we may be especially prone to this as a result of the relatively large license transactions we have historically relied upon accordingly general economic and business conditions may affect our future operating results if the recent unfavorable economic conditions continue the economic slowdown has the potential to materially and adversely affect us a softening demand for software caused by a prolonged slowdown of the economy would result in decreased revenue or lower revenue growth rates 

  

politicalsocial events in recent years including the september 11 2001 tragedy have put further pressure on economic conditions both domestically and internationally the potential turmoil that may result from such events contributes to the uncertainty of the economic climate further reducing predictability and our ability to develop and implement longterm strategic plans in light of the foregoing the impact of these or future similar events may have a materially adverse impact on our business operating results and financial position 

  

moreover the uncertain economic conditions have hampered our ability to make measured predictions as to our business reducing our ability to develop and implement longterm business strategies and models 

  

we may not be able to implement new initiatives successfully 

  

part of our success in the past has resulted from our ability to implement new initiatives our future operating results will continue to depend upon 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

we are dependent on key personnel whose loss could cause delays in our product development and sales efforts 

  

our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical managerial and sales personnel competition for such personnel in the high technology industry is intense we assume that we will continue to be able to attract and retain such personnel the failure to do so however could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

we must continually modify and enhance our products to keep pace with changing technology and we may experience delays in developing and debugging our software 

  

we must continually modify and enhance our products to keep pace with changes in computer software hardware and database technology as well as emerging internet standards our ability to remain competitive will depend on our ability to 

  

 

  

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

also as is common in the computer software industry we may from time to time experience delays in our product development and “debugging” efforts our performance could be hurt by significant delays in developing completing or shipping new or enhanced products among other things such delays could cause us to incorrectly predict the fiscal quarter in which we will realize revenue from the shipment of the new or enhanced products and give our competitors a greater opportunity to market competing products 

  

we may be unable to price our products competitively or distribute them effectively 

  

our success is tied to our ability to price our products and services competitively and to deliver them efficiently including our ability to 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

we may be adversely affected by a decline in demand for plm solutions 

  

we currently derive our license and service revenues from a group of related plm software products and services and we expect this to continue into the future as a result factors affecting the demand for plm software solutions or pricing pressures on this single category could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

  

we depend on sales within the discrete manufacturing market 

  

a large amount of our revenues are related to sales to customers in the discrete manufacturing sector a decline in spending in this sector could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

  

we depend on sales from outside the united states that could be adversely affected by changes in the international markets 

  

a significant portion of our business comes from outside the united states accordingly our performance could be adversely affected by economic downturns in europe or the asiapacific region another consequence of significant international business is that a large percentage of our revenues and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies that fluctuate in value although we may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign exchange option contracts to offset a portion of the foreign exchange fluctuations unanticipated events may have a material impact on our results other risks associated with international business include 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

we may not be able to obtain copyright or patent protection for the software products we develop or our other trademarks 

  

our software products and our other trademarks including our company names product names and logos are proprietary we protect our intellectual property rights in these items by relying on copyrights trademarks patents and common law safeguards including trade secret protection as well as restrictions on disclosures and transferability contained in our agreements with other parties despite these measures there can be no assurance that the laws of all relevant jurisdictions will afford adequate protection to our products and other intellectual property the software industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding copyright patent and other 

intellectual property rights while we have not to date had any significant claims of this type asserted against us there can be no assurance that someone will not assert such claims against us with respect to existing or future products or other intellectual property or that if asserted we would prevail in such claims in the event a lawsuit of this type is filed it could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel whether or not we ultimately prevail certain of our products also contain technology developed and licensed from third parties we may likewise be susceptible to infringement claims with respect to these third party technologies 

  

ii design solutions related considerations 

  

increasing competition in the computer aided design marketplace may reduce our revenues 

  

there are an increasing number of competitive design products some competitive products have reached a level of functionality whereby product differentiation is less likely in and of itself to dislodge incumbent design systems given the training and other startup costs associated with system replacement we are in the process of introducing the next major release of our design solutions proengineer wildfire which focuses on plm interoperability and easeofuse although proengineer wildfire and other initiatives are designed to address these competitive pressures increased competition and further market acceptance of competitive products could have a negative effect on pricing and revenue for our products which could have a material adverse affect on our results 

  

in addition our design software is capable of performing on a variety of platforms several of our competitors focus on single platform applications particularly windowsbased platforms there can be no assurance that we will have a competitive advantage with multiple platform applications 

  

we continue to enhance our existing product line by releasing updates as well as new productsmodules our competitive position and operating results could suffer if 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

growth in the computer aided design industry has slowed 

  

growth in certain segments of the computer aided design solutions industry has slowed and coupled with decreased functional differentiation among flexible engineering tools may adversely affect our ability to penetrate the market for new customers and recapture our market share over the long term we believe our emphasis on plm solutions will allow us to differentiate our design solutions from the competition and invigorate sales of those products however the strategy may not be successful or may take longer than we plan there could be a material adverse affect on our operating results in any quarter if these assumptions prove to be incorrect 

  

iii collaboration and control solutions and overall plm related considerations 

  

we are attempting to capitalize on a webbased businesstobusiness market opportunity known as product lifecycle management plm it may be that our assumptions about this market opportunity are wrong which could adversely affect our results 

  

we have identified plm as a new market opportunity for us and have devoted significant resources toward capitalizing on that opportunity our collaboration and control windchillbased solutions together with our 

design solutions allow us to offer a suite of plm solutions and related services targeted at this market this suite includes software and services that utilize internet technologies to permit our customers’ employees suppliers and customers to collaboratively develop build distribute and manage products throughout their entire lifecycle because the market for software products that allow companies to collaborate on product information on an enterprisewide level is newly emerging and because companies have not traditionally linked customers and suppliers in this process directly we cannot be certain as to the size of this market whether it will grow or whether companies will elect to utilize our products rather than attempt to develop applications internally acquire them from other sources or to forego plm initiatives altogether 

  

in addition companies that have already invested substantial resources in other methods of sharing product information in the designthroughmanufacture process may be reluctant to adopt a new approach that may replace limit or compete with their existing systems or methods we expect that we will continue to need to pursue intensive marketing and sales efforts to educate prospective customers about the uses and benefits of our products demand for and market acceptance of our products will be affected by the success of those efforts 

  

our windchill technology which is central to our plm strategy is not yet well established in the marketplace 

  

the success of our plm strategy will depend in large part on the ability of our windchillbased solutions to meet customer expectations especially with respect to 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

the software is still relatively new if our customers cannot successfully deploy largescale implementation projects or if they determine that we or our partners are unable to accommodate largescale deployments our operating results may be affected 

  

our plm point solutions strategy is developing 

  

we are pursuing a strategy to provide a series of easily deployable plm solutions that address specific business challenges that arise at points along the product lifecycle timeline these plm point solutions utilize our webbased windchill architecture as well as components of our design solutions our strategy is designed to solve customers’ problems relating to costly large scale implementation projects by providing preconfigured fully integrated applications that can be implemented quickly if we are unable to provide these solutions or are unable to meet customer expectations our overall revenue may be adversely affected 

  

we utilize third parties such as systems integrators resellers and strategic partners for the distribution and implementation of windchillbased software solutions which makes it more difficult to manage the sales process 

  

our plm enterprise level solutions may require largescale organizational implementations that in today’s marketplace are often performed by third parties we have entered into and are currently developing additional relationships with third parties and intend to continue to do so using third parties to both implement and promote our products can result in a reduction in our control over the sales process and the delivery of services to our customers in addition the successful utilization of third parties will depend on 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

our utilization of third party service providers and our plm point solutions offerings may crowd out service revenue 

  

our utilization of these third party service providers as well as our introduction of plm point solutions which provide customers more autonomy over solving their problems may have an adverse affect on our service revenue we believe that entering into these relationships and offering these solutions will best serve to expand the coverage of our plm software solutions generate additional license revenue and provide the necessary expertise for their implementation and support if these assumptions prove to be inaccurate or projected additional license revenue andor broader market coverage does not materialize our revenues may be adversely affected 

  

plm software solutions must meet our customer’s expectations for integration with existing systems to generate references for new accounts 

  

our plm software must integrate with our customers’ and their partners’ existing computer systems and software programs ours is one of the first plm solutions and thus many customers will be facing these integration issues for the first time particularly in the context of collaborating with customers supply chain partners and other members of the extended enterprise our customers could become dissatisfied with our products or services if systems integration proves to be difficult costly or time consuming and thus our operating results may be adversely affected moreover due to the emerging nature of the industry and technology the sales process relies in large part on customer references accordingly if our customers become dissatisfied future business and revenues may be adversely affected 

  

competition may increase which may reduce our profits and limit or reduce our market share 

  

the market for our plm software solutions is new highly fragmented rapidly changing and increasingly competitive we expect competition to intensify which could result in price reductions for our products and services reduced gross margins and loss of market share our primary competition comes from 

  

 

  

 

  

in addition our services organization may face increasing competition for followon consulting implementation and education services from other thirdparty consultants and service providers 

  

if the internet does not continue to develop or reliably support the demands placed on it by electronic commerce we may experience a loss of sales 

  

our success depends upon continued growth in the use of the internet as a medium of commerce although the internet is experiencing rapid growth in the overall number of users this growth is a recent phenomenon and may not continue furthermore the use of the internet for commerce is still relatively new as a result a sufficiently broad base of companies and their supply chain may not adopt or continue to use the internet as a medium of exchanging product information our plm strategy would be seriously harmed if 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

our plm strategy will also be seriously harmed if the internet infrastructure is not able to support the demands placed on it by increased usage or the limited capacity of networks to transmit large amounts of data or if delays in the development or adoption of new equipment standards or protocols required to handle increased levels of internet activity or increased governmental regulation cause the internet to lose its viability as a means of communication between manufacturers and their customers and supply chain partners 

  

certain of our windchillbased solutions provide the ability to utilize plm capabilities on internet exchanges portals and marketplaces accordingly their success will be highly dependent upon the success of the internet as a viable collaboration medium and on our successful development and integration of the technologies necessary to offer tools for exchanges portals and other forms of internet marketplaces that are acceptable to customers and suitable for the evolving nature of the internet 

  

iv other considerations 

  

we are filing our form 10k late if as a result our stock is delisted from the nasdaq stock market our stockholders will have less liquidity and our stock price may decline 

  

due to the delay in filing this annual report on form 10k we have received a nasdaq staff determination letter stating that our common stock is subject to delisting from the nasdaq stock market we have requested a hearing to review the staff determination and delisting can be prevented by the hearing panel although we are now current on our sec filings there can be no assurance that the panel will grant ptc’s request for continued listing if our common stock is delisted from the nasdaq stock market this would result in less liquidity for shareholders and potential sales by certain institutional investors which make up a significant portion of our shareholders these factors may have a negative impact on the market price of our stock 

  

our stock price has been highly volatile this may make it harder to resell your shares at the time and at a price that is favorable to you 

  

market prices for securities of software companies have generally been volatile in particular the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations 

  

in addition our expanded focus on delivering webbased solutions may cause us to be viewed in part as an internet company until the third quarter of 2000 the trading prices of internet stocks in general were unusually high under conventional valuation standards such as pricetoearnings and pricetosales ratio since then they have experienced fluctuations unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies the trading prices and valuations of these stocks and of ours may not be predicted negative changes in the public’s perception of the prospects of internet or ecommerce companies or of ptc as an internet company could depress our stock price regardless of our results 

  

also traditionally a large percentage of our common stock has been held by institutional investors purchases and sales of our common stock by certain of these institutional investors could have a significant impact on the market price of the stock for more information please see our proxy statement with respect to our most recent annual meeting of stockholders and schedules 13d and 13g filed with the sec with respect to our common stock 

  

shortterm liquidity 

  

our cash position has declined as a result of losses in the business should those losses continue our liquidity position may be adversely affected which may lead to a diminished ability to implement strategic initiatives andor make investments in our operational infrastructure 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

we face exposure to financial market risks including adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results our primary exposure has been related to local currency revenue and operating expenses in europe and the asiapacific region historically we have hedged currency exposures associated with certain accounts receivable denominated in local currencies and certain anticipated foreign currency net cash flows the goal of our hedging activity is to reduce the impact of currency fluctuations on certain local currency accounts receivable and foreign currency net cash flows the success of this activity depends upon forecasts of transaction activity denominated in various currencies to the extent that these forecasts are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses outstanding forward foreign currency contracts at september 30 2002 matured within three months and did not have a material impact on our financial results 

  

the carrying amounts reflected in the consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value at the balance sheet date due to the short maturities of these instruments 

  

we maintain investment portfolio holdings of various issuers types and maturities these securities are generally classified as available for sale and consequently are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses included in stockholders’ equity given the short maturities and investment grade quality of the portfolio holdings at september 30 2002 a sharp rise in interest rates should not have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio 

  

the following table presents hypothetical changes in fair values in our financial instruments at september 30 2002 that are sensitive to changes in interest rates our modeling technique measures the change in fair value arising from selected potential changes in interest rates movements in interest rates of plus or minus 50 basis points bp and 100 bp reflect immediate hypothetical shifts in the fair value of these investments fair value represents the market principal plus accrued interest and dividends of certain interestratesensitive securities considered cash equivalents or investments for financial reporting purposes at september 30 2002 

  

 

  

the federal reserve has adjusted the federal funds rate by a 75 bp move once and a 50 bp move thirteen times during the last 40 quarters whereas they have never adjusted the federal funds rate by a 100 bp move during the same period the last 50 bp move occurred in november 2002

equity compensation plan information as of september 30 2002 

  

the following table sets forth information regarding our equity compensation plans as of september 30 2002 

  

 

 

 

  

nonstockholder approved plan 

  

the company maintains the ptc 1997 nonstatutory stock option the “plan” the purpose of the plan is to attract and retain key employees and consultants of the company and our majorityowned subsidiaries to provide an incentive for them to achieve longrange performance goals and to enable them to participate in our longterm growth our employees and consultants and those of any of our majorityowned subsidiaries capable of contributing significantly to the successful performance of the company are eligible for option awards under the plan our officers and directors are not eligible to participate in the plan options granted under the plan may only be stock options that are not intended to be “incentive stock options” within the meaning of section 422 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended 

  

the plan is administered by the compensation committee of our board of directors subject to the provisions of the plan the committee has the authority to select the employees and consultants to whom options are granted and determine the terms of each option including the amount exercise price vesting schedule generally in four equal annual installments on each of the first four anniversaries of the date of grant and term which may not exceed ten years the per share exercise price of an option must be at least 100 of the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant 

  

options generally are exercisable only during an optionee’s term of employment or engagement as a consultant and for a period of between ten and ninety days after that term ends in the case of termination as a result of death or permanent disability options generally are exercisable thereafter for twelve months in the case of termination as a result of retirement options generally are exercisable thereafter for three months during the lifetime of the optionee his or her option is exercisable only by him or her and is not transferable except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution 

  

the committee may act to preserve an optionee’s rights under an option in the event of a change in control of the company by i accelerating any time period relating to the exercise of the option ii providing for compensating payments to the optionee iii adjusting the terms of the option to reflect the change in control iv causing the option to be assumed by another entity or v making any other provision that the committee may consider equitable to optionees and in the best interests of the company 

  

the board of directors may amend suspend or terminate the plan or any portion thereof at any time the committee may amend modify or terminate any outstanding award with the respective optionee’s consent unless the amendment would not materially and adversely affect the optionee in which case consent is not required however the committee may not without stockholder approval amend any outstanding option to reduce the exercise price at any time during the term of such option 

  

plans assumed in connection with a merger or other acquisition transaction 

  

the company has also assumed stock options under certain equity plans in the course of its merger and acquisition activities these plans are all inactive and no future options may be granted under them the plans are all substantially similar to the plan discussed above except that certain of the options outstanding are “incentive stock options” within the meaning of section 422 of the code
